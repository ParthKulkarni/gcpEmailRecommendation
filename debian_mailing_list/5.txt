I admit this example is unfair since it's just a bug for a check that
would totally be worth it.
I have very little time for Debian. Each time I update a package, I have
to bump Standards-Version and fix new Lintian warnings. I would
appreciate if we would assess the time developers will take to update
packages because of a change.
