It's worth noting that Linux recently gained SPDX tags indicating the
licence of (almost) every source file in Linux.  But I'm not aware of
any work to list all the copyright holders.  (The only times I've heard
people talk about tracing all the copyright holders, is in the context
of proposed relicensing.)

I have been meaning to look at regenerating debian/copyright based on
the SPDX tags, and possibly sending corrections upstream based on the
current content.  But that's all.
