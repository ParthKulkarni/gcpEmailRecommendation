We'd planned on an ipad version a long time ago, at the time I'd saw talk
of a darwin/arm port, but I don't know what happened to that and I don't
think I'll have time to do it myself.  The game is being designed with a
tablet in mind, though, so if a darwin/arm port does happen then porting it
shouldn't be a huge problem.
