Subject: Haunts: A game done in Go

Hello fellow gopher, this might be of interest to you if you are a gamer:

Several months ago I, along with an artist and a designer, started working
on a small computer game called Haunts.  The codebase is almost entirely
go, with a little cgo and some lua as well, and is open source.  We have a
kickstarter that's been going for a while, if you want to get an idea of
what the game looks like right now, and maybe even support our project :-),
you can check that out here:
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2066438441/haunts-the-manse-macabre


Right now the code is not very well documented so it probably wouldn't be
terribly useful, but here it is if you are particularly curious:

The engine, ideally reusable for future games: github.com/runningwild/glop
The game: github.com/runningwild/haunts
(If you have any questions about any of the code I'd be happy to answer
them, and if you actually want to use any of the code let me know and I
will try to document it as quickly as I can.)


Also, thanks to all of you for producing so many useful (and well
documented) libraries.  I certainly would not have been able to get this
far without your help.

-Jonathan
