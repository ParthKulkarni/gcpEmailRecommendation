Just FYI,
the darwin/arm port is working properly on jailbroken devices (the Go
runtime uses
dynamic code generation to support function closures, so it's not an easy
task to
lift the jailbroken constraint)

It's at bitbucket.org/minux/goios, branch ios follows default branch, and
branch ios-go1
is the iOS equivalent of release-branch.go1
I'm using it almost everyday on iPad 1 (and it should support other
iDevices with
more memory than iPad 1) now.

the major issues are:
1. lack of cgo support (I'm working on it)
2. dynamic code generation means not possible on non-jailbroken devices
3. because of 1, no obj-c bridge possible now; so only command line Go
programs
are possible (which implies you need to jailbreak to use it)
4. originally, it can be cross compiled from PC (I even got a Linux/x86
cross compile
toolchain working!) but as we migrated to cmd/dist based compilation, I
don't have
time to document the cross compilation procedure (it is easier than ever,
but it just
lacks docs); so for now, it can only be compiled on the iDevice. If there's
interest,
I could provide a pre-compiled binary distribution and/or fix the cross
compilation
docs.

Cheers,
minux
