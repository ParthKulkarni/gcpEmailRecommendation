Subject: Can I make a 64bit program in my 32bit computer??

I have a laptop with Ubuntu 32bit version and a Ubuntu 64bit VPS.

My program is a small webserver using GO.

Can I make a program that can run in my VPS when using 32bit laptop? I
know it will be more easy if I install GO src in my VPS and compile it
on the VPS but it take my VPS disk space...


Can I...?
