Looks useful indeed, thanks.  I particularly like that it has no
dependencies except Go itself.

Could you add an option which prepends an arbitrary string when
installing files into $GOROOT?  Most makefiles support something
similar, via the DESTDIR environment variable, so that a distro
package builders can install files into a specific directory hierarchy
which is then collected into the distro package.
