At some point in the near future, goinstall will work well with $GOPATH, 
which tells the builder where to find .a files (it also will look in 
$GOROOT) and where to put them when installing (it will put them here 
instead of $GOROOT).

I will do my best to make gb conform to the expectations set by goinstall.

In fact, I'm sort of bored, maybe I'll do it now.
