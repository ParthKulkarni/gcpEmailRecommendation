Various IDEs (e.g. goclipse <http://code.google.com/p/goclipse/>) support
this sort of thing, and lots of builders also exist.  Depending on how you
want to structure your projects, you may want to have a look at the list of
them on godashboard (at the top of the project
page<http://godashboard.appspot.com/project>).
 I personally prefer gofr
<https://bitbucket.org/kylelemons/gofr/wiki/Home> (it's
allowed me to play a bit with cgo very easily), but I don't know if it
compiles anymore after the open/create changes.
