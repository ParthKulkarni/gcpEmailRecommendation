What's the current state of affairs for building applications which
consist of multiple packages? It seems that the standard
makefile-based approach requires manual ordering of dependencies and
either lots of manual path-wrangling (which is potentially not
future-proof) or staged installation into $GOROOT.  Neither seems
particularly attractive to me.
