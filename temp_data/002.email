This looks very very cool! Congratulations. I love the art style and
the video made me want to play it.

Just curious about something: I saw somewhere "PC/Mac/Linux and Ipad
plans". How can Go code run on iPad right now?

And oh, a nitpicking comment from IRC: the code isn't gofmt'ed. Not a
big deal but would be nice.

Thanks for sharing it. :)
