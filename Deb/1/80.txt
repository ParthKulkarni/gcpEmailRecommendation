Those are good reasons.  (And I'm trying to make them a bit less
true.)  But:
dgit users (including downstreams) who use `dgit clone' to get your
packages will appreciate it if you used `dgit push', because they will
get (a slightly modified version of) your history, rather than just
imports of .dsc's.
Of course that's not of very much direct benefit to you.

This is supported by dgit.
Thanks,
