I agree. However, I prioritize “free software needs people who work on
it”, and by using GitHub, contributions are made significantly easier
for a large number of people.
In my personal experience, I can say that I would not be able to spend
_nearly_ as much of my time on FOSS if it weren’t for GitHub’s
convenient web interface.

All pages on manpages.debian.org already include the git revision at
the bottom of the page, e.g.:
debiman c17f615, see github.com/Debian/debiman
Hence, you can already check out the exact running version. Is that
not sufficient?
(Caveat: the Debian assets are not currently in git. This is already
on my TODO list, though.)

Will be updated soon, thanks.

I personally find the Debian bug system very uncomfortable to use. I
will begrudgingly accept reports made via the BTS, as I do for the
Debian packages I maintain. I don’t want to give up using GitHub’s
issue tracker, though, for my convenience and the convenience of our
users.
