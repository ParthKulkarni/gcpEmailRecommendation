This surprises me. To be clear: There is no published documentation for
the remote command interface to ‘dak’?
Not even on the level of <URL:ftp://ftp.upload.debian.org/pub/UploadQueue/README>?
Is there an open bug report for ‘dak’ requesting a reference to what
commands it accepts?

What tool to ‘dak’ maintainers expect maintainers to use for
communicating commands to ‘dak’?
