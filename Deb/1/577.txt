besides that github supports automated testing too, I think that you're
too much thinking of (big|bigger) patches while I imagine that most of
the patches created via this web editor are rather simple typo fixes and
small correcttions and such.

which also becomes less troublesome if such changes are merged soonâ€¦
To be clear, I do believe in owning ones infrastructures, but I also see
how this encourages small contributions and makes them easy and I do see
this as a good thing too.
I think this is really great to lower the barrier for newcomers, to make
them feel accepted and I too dive deeper eventually.
