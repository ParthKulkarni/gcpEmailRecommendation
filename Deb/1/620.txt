  Description     : Certificate Transparency Log Monitor
 Cert Spotter is a Certificate Transparency log monitor from SSLMate that
 alerts you when a SSL/TLS certificate is issued for one of your domains.
 Cert Spotter is easier than other open source CT monitors, since it does
 not require a database. It's also more robust, since it uses a special
 certificate parser that ensures it won't miss certificates.
 .
 Cert Spotter is also available as a hosted service by SSLMate that
 requires zero setup and provides an easy web dashboard to centrally
 manage your certificates. Visit <https://sslmate.com/certspotter>
 to sign up.
 .
 You can use Cert Spotter to detect:
  * Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised a certificate
    authority and want to impersonate your site.
  * Certificates issued to attackers who are using your infrastructure
    to serve malware.
  * Certificates issued in violation of your corporate policy
    or outside of your centralized certificate procurement process.
  * Certificates issued to your infrastructure providers without your
    consent.
I intend to maintain this under pkg-go.  Andrew Ayer (Cc'ed) is the
upstream author and also a DM (Andrew, if you want to maintain this
instead, happy to take a step back).
