And I have been a very unhappy user with python-django. If by mistake, you
use "gbp import-orig" instead of "git-dpm import-new-upstream" then you're
completely screwed because git-dpm relies on metadata it manually stores
in debian/.git-dpm, it does not rely on git's history to figure out the
appropriate data. Same if you change any patch outside with a third party
tool...
So I have opened the manual page many times to read about the format of
that file and tried to fix up the inconsistent meta-data.
Also it's really painful to use with multiple branches as you can't really
merge branches together:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=801667
It produces a very verbose git history as soon as you have a significant
number of patches, even if most of them do not change at all across a
minor upstream release.
Also it's effectively orphaned, nobody is taking care of bugs.
