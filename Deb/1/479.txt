  Description     : Java API for generating JVM bytecode
 jitescript provides a nice domain specific language around the
 popular ASM Java library for bytecode generation purposes. It's
 modeled after a Ruby library called BiteScript with similar
 functionality.
 .
 The goal is to offer a Java library with a similar API so that
 bytecode generation can be as nice in Java as BiteScript makes
 it in JRuby.
 - It is a dependency for JRuby 9.1.x.x.
 - It will be maintained in the Debian Java team.
