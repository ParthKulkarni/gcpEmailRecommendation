Really, I can't let this pass without plugging dgit :-).
For working on packages that aren't your own, you should use dgit
instead of debcheckout.  If you do then:

With dgit, the VCS you get is always git.

With dgit, the tree you get is always patches-applied.

With dgit, you can use `dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b' directly in the
working tree.  (You can use git clean and git reset if
debian/rules dirties the tree.)

With dgit, you can ignore all of that.

With dgit, you always get the upstream branch.

With dgit, you can even NMU with linear git commits on top of the
existing package, whilch will be turned into nice patches which the
gbp pq (or git-dpm or quilt) user will be happy with.
The only downside is that if the maintainer didn't use dgit, you don't
get the maintainer's history.  But if debcheckout would have given you
a git tree, dgit will set up a `vcs-git' remote which you can `git
fetch', if you want to go history-diving.
