You wouldn't.  You would need to get it removed from testing.

This is more of a sticking point.  I don't know what proportion of CI
failures are going to be due to poorly maintained reverse
dependencies.
But the real answer to this is that "Debian testing should be kept
releaseable" and that means that if your rdepends are busted such that
your changes cause lossage, something has to give.

Maybe an intermediate position would be to respond to a CI failure by:
 * Increasing the migration delay for the affecting package
 * Notifying the affected package maintainers

Yes.
