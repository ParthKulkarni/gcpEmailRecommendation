That has been done.

Unfortunately, bundled in with your request to leave the thread for
2016, was another message arguing that `ip' is easy.  So your request
is actually a request to have the last word.

Can you please provide a simple regexp or parser which, given a
keyword like `secondary', `home', `scope', `valid_lft' or whatever,
will tell whether that keyword is present and if so what (if any)
value it has ?
For example, something like this:
  sub extract_value_from_ip_o_addr_line ($$) {
      my ($line, $keyword) = @_;
      if ($line =~ m/ $keyword (\S+)/) {
          return $1;
      } else {
          return undef;
      }
  }
Only without the many bugs.
Ian.
