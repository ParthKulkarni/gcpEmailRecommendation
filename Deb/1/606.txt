The problem doesn't lie in lack of maintenance nor in lack in features --
many fully free projects have these issues.  What's bad is that the upstream
has a strong motivation to not accept patches that compete with their
commercial offering.
The project is still DFSG-free and can be forked, but it's not like a team
capable of maintaining something that size will pop up from nothing.  And if
we get too uppity, upstream will become hostile.
Meow!
