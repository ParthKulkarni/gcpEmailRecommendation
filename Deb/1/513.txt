Hi,
as a lot of people are already aware, APT and dpkg have disagreed
on architecture wildcards for quite some time, because the approach
taken in apt was "weird".
I have just committed a change that makes APT uses dpkg's triplet
or tuplettables, depending on how new your dpkg is:
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/apt/apt.git/commit/?id=6ede895
I expect the change to land in unstable tomorrow.
A wildcard like any-armel won't work anymore. This wildcard was
understodd by apt, but not by dpkg. In dpkg, armel matches any-arm
instead. As these wildcards have been interpreted differently
before, it is assumed that they are not used yet in critical
places.
The approach taken to implement this is slightly weird, I want
to thank James Clarke <jrtc27@jrtc27.com> for providing an
initial patch in http://bugs.debian.org/748936.
It does however validate against all architecture and wildcard
combinations known by dpkg, producing no false positives and
no false negatives.
Having one understanding of wildcards allows us to finally use
these wildcards properly. So for example, any-arm can now be
used for armel and armhf building.
There is one caveat however: Ubuntu still ships a dpkg
1.18.10 which uses triplets, whereas Debian ships a newer
dpkg that uses quadruplets. As an example, to match an architecture
like armhf (arm with glibc and eabihf ABI) for all kernels:
	gnueabihf-any-arm	on Ubuntu
	eabihf-gnu-any-arm        on Debian
If you want to use patterns that combine a special ABI variant with
a libc variant, it is best to just include both variants in the
list IMO so it works with old and current dpkg versions.
Thanks,
Julian
