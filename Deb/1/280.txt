I think one of the main problems with `apt(-cache) search` is that what
it takes is a regexp, and that most of the time, you're better served by
doing your search with \b as both prefix and suffix.
$ apt-cache search '\bgif\b' | wc -l
138
$ apt-cache search gif | wc -l
198
More extreme example, which actually happened to me a couple days ago
because I was checking whether there is a package for the KAGE engine (a
glyph generator for chinese characters ; http://fonts.jp/engine.html)
$ apt-cache search kage | wc -l
31104
$ apt-cache search '\bkage\b' | wc -l
1
