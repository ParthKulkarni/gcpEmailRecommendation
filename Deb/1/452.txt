Hello all,

If you upload a new version of a library that removes a symbol, then all
reverse dependences must get fixed in or removed from testing anyway. In this
scenario the new lib would already not propagate as the rdepends would FTBFS in
the binNMU against the new library SONAME (assuming that you did bump it).
OTOH, if you did not bump the SONAME, then this is an RC bug anyway which then
gets caught by the test.
For other scenarios which aren't already caught by britney's installability
checks (change in behaviour which doesn't reflect in changed ABI) we actually
do want the same: If we can catch a regression through a test, then it makes
zero sense to automatically land that regression in testing anyway -- the whole
point of this exercise is to allow us to land transitions with confidence and
sort out transitions in unstable *before* landing regressions in testing.
