  Description     : high performance Java implementation of the Ruby programming language
 truffleruby (previously known as the Truffle runtime of JRuby) is an
 experimental implementation of an interpreter for JRuby using the
 Truffle AST interpreting framework and the Graal compiler.
 .
 Itâ€™s an alternative to the IR interpreter and bytecode compiler.
 The goal is to be significantly faster, simpler and to have more
 functionality than other implementations of Ruby.
 - It will be maintained in the Debian Java team.
 - Originally this was part of JRuby 9.x.x.x releases but the
   project has matured enough to be a project on its own.
