  Description     : status page system
Cachet is a PHP-written and responsive status page system which improves
downtime (support-wise and customer-wise). It is translated to over ten
languages and sports a JSON API as well as two-factor authentication
(using Google Authenticator).
A demo site is available at https://demo.cachethq.io/ and a production
site of another FLOSS project is at https://status.lineageos.org/.
(That's actually how I stumbled upon it.)
