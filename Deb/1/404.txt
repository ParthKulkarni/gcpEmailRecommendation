I prefer my other suggestion, that humans should write bugs if
necessary to unblock migration.  Because:
 * It eliminates a timing problem, where the testing migration
   infrastructure[1] needs to somehow decide whether the test have
   been run.  (This is needed because in the future we may want to
   accelerate migration, perhaps dramatically when there are lots of
   tests; and then, the testing queue may be longer than the minimum
   migration delay.)
 * See my other mail about the problems I anticipate with
   automatically opened bug reports.

You should help enhance autopkgtest so that a single test script can
report results of multiple test.  This will involve some new protocol
for those test scripts.
