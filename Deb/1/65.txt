Are there really upstreams that do that? I'd expect that the primary
consumer of Debian patches are other distributions, downstreams, and
users.
I'd think that anything that's relevant for upstream development is
forwarded to upstream by the maintainer in whatever format upstream
prefers. This requires extra time, but I would be surprised to hear if
there are maintainers that have sufficient time to create patches that
are suitable for upstream, but don't have the little extra time to send
them upstream.
Best,
