  Description     : Go library for decoding generic map values into native structures
 mapstructure is a Go library for decoding generic map values to structures and
 vice versa, while providing helpful error handling.
 .
 This library is most useful when decoding values from some data stream (JSON,
 Gob, etc.) where you don't quite know the structure of the underlying data
 until you read a part of it. You can therefore read a map[string]interface{}
 and use this library to decode it into the proper underlying native Go
 structure.
 .
 This package is a fork of the golang-github-mitchellh-mapstructure
 package to more elegantly support decoding data with an unknown
 structure by using the runtime reflection features of the Go
 language.
