  Description     : seed data records manipulation library
Provides a framework for manipulation of SEED (Standard for the Exchange
 of Earthquake Data) data records.
I think this package is relevant because it is a reference implementation of
the SEED format manipulation. It will be a dependency on other packages allowing,
for instance, realtime exchange of seismic data around the world.
I use these tools on a daily basis, no other package provide this functionality
(as far as I know).
I plan to maintain this package and create other sismological related package,
as a maintainer beginner, I definitively need a sponsor.
My work on this package basically consisted in learning packaging, autotoolizing
the upstream source distribution. I plan to submit autotoolizing patch and man page
typos patch upstream. I will also ask the upstream author if he his interested
in co-maintaining this package.
