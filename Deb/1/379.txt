Hi -devel & Helmet,
I recently discovered <https://dedup.debian.net/>.  First, thanks to
Helmut for setting this up.
I've just removed some duplicates in a package [0] with symlinks, but
I was wondering if I am missing a page or feature where I can see all
"my" offenses against duplicated content, preferably ordered by (for
example) the number of bytes duplicated?
Seeing the worst offenders in the Debian archive would also be
fascinating.
