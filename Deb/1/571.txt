Please don't forget about git-request-pull(1), or it's simpler cousin,
"to fix this bug please merge branch foo from repo bar".
'bar' could well be on GitHub -- I don't think anyone objects to using
GitHub purely as a repository hosting service, because that involves no
lock-in.
Using the Debian BTS doesn't have to mean messing about with patches,
and GitHub did not invent the pull request.
