Personally, I tend to use phrases like "packages that depend on", or
sometimes "packages with Depends on" (which also expands nicely into
"packages with Depends or Recommends on").  Somewhat more verbose, but
unambiguously clear.
For instance, instead of "reverse-dependencies of libfoo-dev", I'd write
"packages with Depends on libfoo-dev".
