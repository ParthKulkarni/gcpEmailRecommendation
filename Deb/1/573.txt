If someone isn't cloning the repository locally, how is that someone
creating the patch which is in the git repo which is requested to be
pulled?
And if someone isn't pushing that locally-cloned repo back to github,
how is that someone getting the local changes into github to be pulled?
(AFAIK, the official way of getting your local changes into github is
with 'git push'; at least that's what I had to use the one time I tried
to work with github other than to clone a repo hosted there, although
admittedly my network situation is a bit unusual.)
