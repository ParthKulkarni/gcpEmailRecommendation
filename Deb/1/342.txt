  Description     : sheaf cohomology of line bundles on toric varieties
The algorithm for the computation of sheaf cohomologies for line bundles on
toric varieties presented in "Cohomology of Line Bundles: A Computational
Algorithm" by Ralph Blumenhagen, Benjamin Jurke, Thorsten Rahn, and Helmut
Roschy has been implemented in a convenient and high-performance C/C++
application called cohomCalg.
The optional cohomCalg Koszul extension serves as a Mathematica 7 frontend and
allows for the easy computation of hypersurface and complete intersection
cohomologies, following the material presented in "Cohomology of Line Bundles:
Applications" by the same authors.
I plan to maintain this package as a member of the Debian Science Team.
