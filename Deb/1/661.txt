the src:icedove package has a huge list of needed dependencies to get
the package build. So mainly at least one dependency that is missing
will break the build.
For this we (the package maintainers) use usually a chroot to build the
icedove package. As you also probably want to change the source of the
Icedove you will need to handle the debian patches then.
The icedove packages are using git-buildpackage to document and utilize
the changes we have made. So I would suggest to follow the hints we've
written into the wiki for people like you who want to rebuild Icedove.
https://wiki.debian.org/Icedove/Devel#Icedove_Package_Development
You will need to create a chroot first before you can start if you use
the gbp workflow. We use cowbuilder/pbuilder for that, but sbuild will
also work.
For creating a cowbuilder/pbuilder chroot you can use git-pbuilder (from
git-buildpackage). Please see the wiki page for that.
https://wiki.debian.org/git-pbuilder
Feel free to contact me directly if you need more help while
(re)creating Icedove packages.
