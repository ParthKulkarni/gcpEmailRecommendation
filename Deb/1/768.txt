The last three lines actually describe precisely what this package does
NOT do. It only contains a list of nouns whose plurals are irregular. It
doesn't contain any JavaScript at all.
This package is a dependency for https://github.com/sindresorhus/plur.
I don't know why you'd ever want this to use this irregular-plurals list
separately from the package plur, but I guess this is just because of
the whole node.js mindset.
It also only works for the English, it might be nice to add that to the
description.
