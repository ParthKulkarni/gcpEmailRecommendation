  Description     : Graphical tool for rapidly creating and editing node-and-edge style graphs in TikZ.
TikZiT is a graphical tool for rapidly creating and editing
node-and-edge style graphs. It was originally created to aid in the
typesetting of "dot" diagrams of interacting quantum observables (see
arXiv:0906.4725), but can be used as a general graph editing program.
I used to maintain a version of this software in an Ubuntu PPA that
was moderately popular. To this day a few people e-mail me requesting
updated versions of the software, so I believe this package will be
useful.
There was little development following the 2013 release of version
1.0. However, development has recently restarted and a version 1.1
appears to be forthcoming.
I would need a sponsor for the package.
