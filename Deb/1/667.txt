Please don't email me personally. I asked you to provide more
information, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm the person who will
be able to help you.
One thing I can tell you is that Debian doesn't ship Oracle JDK, and
we can't provide support for it. And why do you use it when Debian
already ships Java?
