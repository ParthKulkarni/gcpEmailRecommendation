  Description     : Emacs command to cycle between quotation marks
This package provides the `cycle-quotes' command to cycle between
different string quote styles.
For example, in JavaScript, there are three string quote characters:
", ` and '.  In a JavaScript buffer, with point located someplace
within the string, `cycle-quotes' will cycle between the following
quote styles each time it's called:
--> "Hi, it's me!" --> `Hi, it's me!` --> 'Hi, it\'s me!'
As seen in the above example, `cycle-quotes' tries to escape and
unescape quote characters intelligently.
I intend to maintain this as part of the pkg-emacsen team.
