  Description     : automatic resizing of Emacs windows to the golden ratio
When working with many windows at the same time, each window has a
size that is not convenient for editing. This package helps on this
issue by resizing automatically the windows you are working on to the
size specified in the "Golden Ratio". The window that has the main
focus will have the perfect size for editing, while the ones that are
not being actively edited will be re-sized to a smaller size that
doesn't get in the way, but at the same time will be readable enough
to know it's content.
