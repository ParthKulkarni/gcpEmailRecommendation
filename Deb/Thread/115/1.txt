I notice the dbg package for the kernel was moved, but it doesn't appear
to be installable.
I've added the necessary entry to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://debug.mirrors.debian.org/debian-debug/ stretch-debug main
non-free contrib
and then I try to get the package:
# apt-get install -t stretch-debug linux-image-amd64-dbgsym

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 linux-image-amd64-dbgsym : Depends: linux-image-4.8.0-2-amd64-dbgsym
but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
It looks like the kernel was built over a week ago:
# uname -aLinux srv1 4.8.0-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.8.15-2 (2017-01-04)
x86_64 GNU/Linux
so would the dbgsym package still be in Incoming?
