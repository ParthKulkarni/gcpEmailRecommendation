Package: general
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
I have a Debian 8 on my laptop since several months now and it worked all fine.
However, since about 2 weeks, the laptop freezes when I suspend a logged-on
session.
My informations :
        - I can successfully do CTR+ALT+F1 after resume, only the display is
broken.
        - I tried to uninstall nvidia drivers and backlisting nouveau : nothing
changed
        - It only happens when there is a session logged on. If I logout before
suspend, the computer can resume normally.
        - I tried to suspend both by closing the lid of the laptop and by
pressing ALT while clicking on the shutdown button in the top right corner :
same bug
I don't "hack" with the system a lot. I mostly browse the internet and do a
weekly "apt-get update && install".
Best Regards,
Antoine
