Same result with /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8/bin/java ?

I think you probably need to include something like
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk8/lib
Or similar; the missing library libjli.so is probably somewhere under
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk8, and you need to include that in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
Within Debian, libjli.so is provided by the various OpenJDK packages,
but you probably do not want to mix those with the Oracle JDK.
I am not an expert on Oracle JDK, I have not got it installed nor have
I attempted the above myself; this is intended to try and be a helpful
hint or clue as to what to try next. I probably can't help you any
further.
I'm marking this bug closed because it is not a bug in Debian.
