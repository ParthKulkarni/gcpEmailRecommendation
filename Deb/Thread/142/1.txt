  Description     : Python library to parse Apertium stream format
This is a Python 3 library for parsing (converting to Python data
structure) text in Apertium stream format [1].
This library is useful for people developing Apertium (Apertium is a
machine translation engine that is already in Debian) language pairs
in case if they want to do python scripts for automating their
workflow (finding unknown words from morphological analyser, etc.),
also people can build new applications for quite variety of purposes,
e.g. for research on natural language processing. I have used
personally streamparser for automatic Constraint
Grammar generation: https://github.com/Putti/autocg. To my best
knowledge there is no other similar library for Python (that is at
least this good quality, some hacks might be lying around in the
Apertium project's repository).
I haven't submitted any packages to Debian archive before and I'm
still learning packaging. I have started the packing work already,
it's here:
<https://svn.code.sf.net/p/apertium/svn/branches/packaging/external/streamparser/debian/>. I'm
reading the new maintainer guide and policies at the moment so it
still might take some days or weeks to get the package in a good
shape. This package, when ready, needs a sponsor. Kartik Mistry has
handled other Apertium related packages before so maybe he/she would
be willing to take on this package (I haven't asked Kartik yet).
