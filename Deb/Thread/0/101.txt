As discussed briefly in the thread from 2016-12, my counter-proposal
is that the two packages should ideally:
* Be alternative implementations of the same set of features, so that
  any features that people actually use should be implemented in each.
* Eventually converge so closely that they merge, and there is just
  one ‘dput’ that is the single obvious package to install.

I look forward to working (gradually and carefully) with the ‘dput-ng’
maintainers to make this request redundant :-)
