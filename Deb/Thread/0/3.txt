Every other bug tracker, including all new ones like github, by default
sends emails to submitter (and everyone who ever touched the bug). Debian
is the odd one out. Filtering mails at the recieving side is easy.

I understand your position, but my gut feeling is vas majority of users
filing bugs expect to be kept upto date on how the fixing proceeds. So the
subscibe by default and a "Subscribe: no" pseudoheader is better.
