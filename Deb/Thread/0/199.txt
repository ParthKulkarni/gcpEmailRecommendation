In my experience, systemd-shim never worked in the first place, so this is
no regression.  I see results that Ian observes since the day policykit and
friends were recompiled against logind rather than consolekit.  It's
somewhat puzzling that it's reported to have worked for _some_ people in the
past.
At home, I'm still using my set of rebuilds against consolekit (semi-public
repository: http://angband.pl/debian nosystemd-{jessie,stretch})[1].  That's
not because of any love towards consolekit -- it's a piece of crap that
needs to die -- but because it works for me.
Neither systemd-shim nor consolekit are solutions that are viable in the
long term, the sooner we get rid of both, the better.  I don't know what's
a good alternative, though.  Loginkit is vapourware.  Elogind maybe?
Meow!
[1]. Also built with all references to libsystemd0 eradicated; this is not
because of bloat concerns but because in multiple cases the detection is
done at compile time rather than runtime, thus purging libsystemd0 is a
cheap way to ensure it's not needed.
