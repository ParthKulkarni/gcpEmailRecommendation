nobody stops you from build-testing pull requests. But people using the
web interface usually don't change lots of things because coding in the
web editor is no fun. Such changes are small and easy to review usually.
And you can always fetch the pull request and use your command line tools.

its not more or less insane then what you do in your daily git usage.
either you review things properly or not.

why should one do that?

You start to sound like a troll.
So far I think I've created like a dozen of pull requests to fix typos
using the web interface, and I think I've accepted an even bigger amount
of changes without rebuilding everything before accepting the pull
request. A lot of changes don't even need a rebuild to know that they
won't break things.
