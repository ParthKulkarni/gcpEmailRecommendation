Well, sometimes I remember I was shocked to learn in the MBR partition
layout 62 sectors were just left unused. All the wasted space!
Reality check, please. Disk got incredibly cheap. Unless you on some
special and expensive storage, the cost for the additional space the
uncompressed modules take is somewhere below 20 (Euro)cent, even on an
SSD. I won't stop anyone from working on this project, but I think it's
just not worth the efforts.
