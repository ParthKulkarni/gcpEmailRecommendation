We'd be happy to have more people use it.
There is also gitlab.debian.net alias for this instance, though it will
need a local account to work. There is a feature request for supporting
multiple domains https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19449

The entire idea of that instance is to make a 100% Free Software public
git hosting service available to the Free Software community.
Yes, it is running gitlab debian package backported for jessie
(https://people.debian.org/~praveen/gitlab). All code is in debian main.
We'll switch to stretch once its released so it will be a fully official
package (though I plan to provide updates via stretch-backports, which
is still official debian).
