  Description     : Java library providing simple directed graph implementation
 A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph (that is a set of vertices
 connected by edges), where the edges have a direction associated with
 them.
 .
 This library is currently used in JRuby implementation but it's perfectly
 reusable for any other project requiring this kind of data structures.
- Needed as a dependency for JRuby 9.x.
- It will be maintained in the Debian Java team.
