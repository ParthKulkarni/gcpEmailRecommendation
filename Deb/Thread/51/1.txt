  Description     : accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner
 DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches
 and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software
 tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein
 search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs and
 assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.
Remark: The original upstream name 'diamond' was changed since
there is a package in Debian with this name.  The package will be
maintained by the Debian Med team at
   https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debian-med/diamond-aligner.git
