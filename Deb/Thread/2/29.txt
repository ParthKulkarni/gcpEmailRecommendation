I believe the git-dpm approach would give you everything you want.  The
explanation on http://git-dpm.alioth.debian.org/ is pretty good.
I personally think that technically git-dpm's approach is the best - but
unfortunately the program itself is effectively unmaintained and
apparently/consequently not used by many people.
Best,
