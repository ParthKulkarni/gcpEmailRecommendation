  Description     : password strength checking library for Python
 Safe provides a small library to check a proposed password against some
 obviously insecure patterns, and also against a dictionary of 10k common
 passwords. It also checks for the presence of mixed case characters, numbers
 and symbols. Usage is as simple as:
 .
 import safe
 strength = safe.check('x*V-92Ba')
 strength.strength #=> 'strong'
 bool(strength)    #=> True
I intend to package this within in Python modules team and look for a sponsor
there. It is a dependency of flexget (ITP: #724718).
