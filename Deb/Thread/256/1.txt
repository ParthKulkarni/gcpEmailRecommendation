Hi,
libibverbs provides symbols for their public library API and internal
symbols for their plugins libraries. Sadly the internal symbols are
exposed in libibverbs. Upstream wants to make these symbols private,
but without bumping the soname.
The rdma-core source package will ship libibverbs and all library
plugins. So this source package can ensure that no incompatible
combination of the library and the plugins is installed. Now my
question: How can I check if there are packages in Debian that consume
these internal symbols?
