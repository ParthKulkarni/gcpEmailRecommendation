  Description     : Bulk rename utility
  Man page URL    : https://docs.neurobin.org/man/man1/rnm.html
 Renames files/directories in bulk. Naming scheme (*Name String*) can be
applied or regex replace can be performed to modify file names. It uses PCRE2
(revised version of PCRE) regex to provide search (and replace) functionality.
 .
 It provides versatile options to modify names, delete/replace part of it,
indexing, case conversion, insert text, insert various file information like
modification time, access time, permission etc.., insert parent directory names
and many more.
 .
 File search functionality is provided with PCRE2 regex. Fixed string search is
also possible.
 .
 Operations (rename, changing names, search) are selective of file type
(directory, file, link).
 .
 Files can be sorted by name, modification time, access time, size, file type
(directory, file, link) etc..
 .
 It provides an undo functionality to move back unwanted rename operations.
Different **rnm** operations on different directory remembers their own undo
history.
 .
 Simulations can be run instead of actual rename to view the potential outcome
as program output on terminal with the *-sim* option.
 - if there are other packages providing similar functionality, how does it
compare?
 * There are lots of renaming tools out there, but the indexing and sorting
facility makes a difference here and also the ability to insert different level
of parent directory names.
 * Indexes can be represented in binary, hexadecimal or in other bases (2-36)
or in scientific form or Latin form.
 - The precision of index is not limited by system limitation (It uses gmplib).
 * Index flags are available to format the indexes in desirable ways.
 * A regex replace operation to change the name or search operation can be
performed selectively to only files/directories/links by simply passing
modifiers ('f' for file, 'd' for directory, 'l' for link).
 * Reverse search is as easier as passing a modifier '!' with the searh string.
 - why is this package useful/relevant?
 * Because renaming files is a basic operation that everyone needs to do and
there are lots criteria they want to meet.
 - is it a dependency for another package?
 * No.
 - do you use it?
 * I use it very frequently, primarily for indexing files.
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
 * I am always available for any problems/bugs regarding my software. The
maintainer would need to email me or file bug reports on the original github
repository, though I wish to be a maintainer myself :D.
