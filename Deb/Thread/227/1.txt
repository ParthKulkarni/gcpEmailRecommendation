Package: general
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
   * What led up to the situation?
   I have installed Debian with xfce from the weekly builds found here: http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/list-cd/
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
    I Added the xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin to the xfce4-panel
   * What was the outcome of this action?
   I can see that the plugin icon is greyed out, and when hovering over it I get the message "Not connected to the PulseAudio server".
   I cannot adjust the sound from the plugin.
