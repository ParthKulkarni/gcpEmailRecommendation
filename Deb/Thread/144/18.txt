I got that page as follows:
Type into my browser address bar
  https://manpages.debian.org/
This redirects to
  https://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi
and then if I type in details I get a url like the above.
Hrm.
I just looked with HEAD(1) and I don't get the redirect.
Is it possible that there was previously a permanent redirect issued
from the toplevel URL to this cgi-bin one ?  I'm not sure how to
bypass such a thing.

Of course.  But the question is: is circumventing this ever the
easiest way to fix things ?
My experience of running online services is that in a crisis it can
sometimes be most convenient (fastest!) to use some kind of ad-hoc
deployment method, up to and including editing the running code
directly in a text editor.
Obviously there are risks to that kind of thing, but I want the
service operator to think about keeping the service running, and *not*
to have to worry about publishing source code.

  NB this is the source to the special git server that `dgit push'
  talks to; browse.dgit.d.o is simply git repos published using cgit.
