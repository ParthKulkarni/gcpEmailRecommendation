Oh it's mandoc.  OK, sorry for misreading the web page.
Are you using the backport on the manpages.d.o server, then ?

The source for this patched version is in only available in NEW ?
(Ie only to DDs ?)
You see, I find this kind of chasing tiresome - whether I'm the user,
or the service operator.  I expect you do too.  Of course you're
probably hoping not to need to patch mandoc again.
How did you deploy the patched mandoc ?  I want to know this so I can
know how the source code can be automatically found and published.
Ian.
