Same here. Also since I've moved my major packages to github, a constant
stream of pull requests for even simple bugs like typos is coming in.
People are used to github and how to create a pull request on the web
interface, and I can just merge these changes with a few clicks.
Sometimes free as in free beer is better for the community than "free".
travis.debian.net makes it extra easy to test your commits on travis-ci
- perfectly integrated with github. I love to use that.
