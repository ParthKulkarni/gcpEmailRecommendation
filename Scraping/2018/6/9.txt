Comments/Problems:
WiFi is supported except that
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185661 currently means
you need to obtain a working configuration file (e.g., from the
ChromiumOS repository linked in that bug report) and make it
available to the kernel somewhere it will find it, for example
/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4356-pcie.txt. Lack of this file will
manifest during installation as the WiFi device getting detected and
SSIDs are listed, but you'll be unable to actually connect to any of
them.
I didn't test Tasks installation as I prefer starting with bare
minimum installation and carefully tracking individual packages I
need. I can't imagine there would be any problem installing typical
Tasks on this device.
