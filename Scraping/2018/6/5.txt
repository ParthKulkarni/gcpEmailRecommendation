Well, in X XK_dead_caron is separate from XK_dead_circumflex.  The issue
with Linux is that it only has a few dead keys. Maybe we should just go
and define all X11 deadkeys in Linux (there are like 55 of them, that
will fit), to be done with the issue.
Now, whenever there are still shortcut conflicts, languages have their
own compose file in
/usr/share/X11/local/$LANG.UTF-8/Compose
