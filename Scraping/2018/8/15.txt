I would like to be able to specify -m reflink=1 when creating XFS
partitions at installation time.  There is not currently a way to pass
options through partman recipes to mkfs.
Please consider extending the partman recipe format to allow options
to be passed.  As it'd only be used in shooting-yourself-in-the-foot-is-OK
preseed situations it wouldn't need much validation.
