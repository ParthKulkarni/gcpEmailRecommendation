If in the course of a debian install I need to execute a shell and logs 
are being preserved, will what I type in the shell also be saved to one of 
the log files?  I have a procedure to get a secure wifi login done after 
reboot and post-install and this way I could send logs and it would be 
available for others.  The secure wifi connection happens with ifup with a 
little help from wpa_passphrase and grep and ex.
