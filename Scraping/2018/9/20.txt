I don't think the data will be recoverable unless you have a backup of 
the LUKS header. The way LUKS works is that data is not encrypted with a 
passphrase directly but with a key that is encrypted to a set of 
passphrases. If you worked purely through the installer's UI you will 
have overwritten your LUKS header and hence will be unable to decrypt 
the data ever again because the key material is lost. The position of 
the LUKS header on disk is always in the same place.
Data erase is really just about overwriting the existing data with 
zeros, which I understand is pretty confusing. Technically the data is 
already erased by the fact that the header is overwritten but some 
people want to be sure and write random data (or in the case of 
non-encrypted disks zeros) to the disk before deploying the system into 
production.
Kind regards
