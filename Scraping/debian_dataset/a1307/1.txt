Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.89
Severity: normal
It might be useful for Debian or derivatives to change the default awk
provider, which currently is mawk - a package that has de facto been
unmaintained in Debian for several years.  The original-awk package is
in my experience considerably less buggy and similarly small.
However, all the scripts/* files in debootstrap currently hardcode mawk,
making it impossible to swap the priorities of mawk and original-awk
without instantly breaking debootstrap. :-(
