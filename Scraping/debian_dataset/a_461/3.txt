There's been a mistake in testing methodology, I compared
with Contents files uncompressed as well. Real values are more
like
	188 vs  75 MB for just Packages
	446 vs 278 MB for all files (Sources too)
so, like a 60% saving for systems without apt-file, and a
40% saving for systems with apt-file installed.
