It is proposed to use USB sticks instead of DVDs, 8GB sticks would be 
sufficient.

Besides the additional amount of work it won't be useful: Debian Edu 
still defaults to use 32-bit for the LTSP chroot (to be able to support 
as much old hardware as possible). So in most cases 64-bit packages are 
required for the server side and 32-bit ones for LTSP.

I'm unable to reproduce it for a default combi server installation 
(profiles 'Main-Server, Workstation, LTSP-Server, KDE). Could you tell 
us more about your installation?

Yes. Although there was still space left on /var during my recent test, 
some more space would be good to be on the safe side.

Thank you very much for your report, Hans.
