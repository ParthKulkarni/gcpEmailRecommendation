There's no downside to frequent releases.  There is a big fat downside to
requiring a very recent release to build the current one.  And frequent
releases make you feel that you can drop compat despite the time difference
being small in absolute terms.
Ie: "release early, release often" is good for technical reasons, but may
fail psychological ones.
