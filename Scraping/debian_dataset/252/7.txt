That is certainly not ridiculous. But, I had a look at the release plan
for OpenSSL at https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html, and
it seems there only is one LTS release, namely 1.0.2, which will be
supported until the very end of 2019. 1.1.0 is only supported until
September 2018. In that context it is strange that we switched to 1.1.0
in stretch already. Let's hope there is an LTS for 1.1.x in time for
buster.

Maybe not currently for Debian or Fedora derivatives, but some
distributions (Alpine, OpenELEC amongst others) have switched to
LibreSSL as the default, and some (Gentoo, unsurprisingly) have it as an
option.
I see two main forces determining which fork of a library will be used:
either distributions themselves will choose based on technical and other
merits, or important applications will favor one of the forks, forcing
the decision for distributions. OpenSSH is now applying some force, I
have no idea what programs are out there that can only work with
OpenSSL. I assume those that moved to OpenSSL 1.1 and ditched OpenSSL
1.0 compatibility, but I wonder how many there are.
It would be interesting to recompile all packages that Build-Depend:
libssl-dev with LibreSSL, and see what actually breaks...

I don't see why it couldn't be in its own package even if OpenSSH was
the only user. It doesn't change the maintenance burden.
