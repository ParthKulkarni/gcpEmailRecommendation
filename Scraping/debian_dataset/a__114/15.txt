I am not one either. I have a few skills at general script
programming, I can understand basic code and I have a few skills in
system administration.
Which was indeed enough for doing, I guess, quite decent job in
maintaining packages. The more important part is certainly having a
good knowledge of the Debian ecosystem, good knowledge of one's own
limits for technical work.....and enough will to ask for help when
you're not confident in actions to take.
