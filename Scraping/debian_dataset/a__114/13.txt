1.
I just subscribed to cron mails.
2.
Above you mention "re-enable cron entries". However, I cannot find any such
disabled entries.
I assume the l10n-sync process is currently enabled, or am I missing something?
(I'm planning to test the modified script via some weblate commits, that's
why.)
3.
While logged into dillon, I found an old example-preseed.txt file under
/srv/d-i.debian.org/www/
which is an outdated file from squeeze. I tried to remove it, but lacking
permission.
Adding myself to d-i gid is missing here, probably?
