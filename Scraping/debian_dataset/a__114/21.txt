Done.
Some cron jobs still fail. Until the reasons have been investigated, I have
disabled those (3) jobs for now.
Then I started to test the l10n-sync script.
And it turns out, that there is some changed behaviour, when comparing
the old "svn st" lines against the new "git status -s -uno" lines.
The relevant diff is this:
  # Do not accept working on an unclean copy
- if $(svn st $DI_COPY/packages/po | grep -q "^C") ; then
-	error "$DI_COPY seems to contain some SVN conflict files"
+ if $($git status -s -uno $DI_COPY/packages/po) ; then
+ 	error "$DI_COPY seems to contain some GIT conflict files"
+	error "in packages/po."
        error "Please fix this before launching the script again"
        exit 1
As it seems, the svn st line returns 0, if there _are_ changes in the ../po dir
while the new git status line returns 0, if there _are_no_ changes.
So I tried to change "if" into "if !" and that seems to work so far, however
I would like to receive a short confirmation from coding people for this
(/me having no coding skills so far). 
It seems to work at least.

I cannot find such repo on salsa.
Does this need to be created?
