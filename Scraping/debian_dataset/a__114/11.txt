However, with this simplified variant it fails. So I left it as is for now.
This morning, I performed a l10n-sync run with my latest modifications, and
it went through so far. But when committing, I had to give username and 
password to commit. What's the way to make it non-interactive?
(I am somewhat confused: I gave "holgerw" as username and my password, but
in the git log, it now reports username "D-I role". ???)
