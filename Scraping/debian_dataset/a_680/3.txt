OK. But "should" != "must".
Anyway, I'm reopening the bug report for the sake of issue tracking.
I'm very sorry but given that:
 - Debian is not my paid work,
 - I don't have time to work on this right now,
 - we are in hard freeze
I'm not able to fix this in the next future... but your patches are
always welcome. ;)
Feel free to join the maintenance, if interested.
Cheers.
