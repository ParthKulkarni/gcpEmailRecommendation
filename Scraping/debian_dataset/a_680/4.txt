I was right -- it IS a Debian Policy violation:
    * 4.13 Convenience copies of code *
    Some software packages include in their distribution convenience
    copies of code from other software packages, generally so that users
    compiling from source don't have to download multiple packages.
    Debian packages should not make use of these convenience copies
    unless the included package is explicitly intended to be used in
    this way. If the included code is already in the Debian archive in
    the form of a library, the Debian packaging should ensure that
    binary packages reference the libraries already in Debian and the
    convenience copy is not used. If the included code is not already in
    Debian, it should be packaged separately as a prerequisite if
    possible.

That seems to describe this situation EXACTLY.
