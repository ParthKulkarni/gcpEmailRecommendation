I'm saying this because the following lines are left untouched and are
called in all cases:
                umount_on_exit /proc
                umount_on_exit /proc/bus/usb
(They are in the context of your unified diff)
They should only be called if debootstrap is mounting /proc by itself.

Yes, if and only if multiple mounts on /sys do not cause the same problem than multiple
mounts on /proc. Otherwise you want to protect the mount call with a check ensuring that
/sys is not yet mounted.
