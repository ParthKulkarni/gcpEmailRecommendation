It helps to spot things. I notice:
   siridb-connector (U)
which wasn't even in Debian until February this year. Your original list
says:
siridb-connector needs rebuild (no .buildinfo)
So apparently the (binary) build that I uploaded (this is still the only
upload) didn't contain the .buildinfo. That makes at least your subject
(in this case) ambiguous. True, the package hasn't been rebuild ever,
but maybe some have but are lacking the .buildinfo due to tooling issues
we had/have? Maybe we need to fix those first?
Another thing, you probably thought about it, but if we care for the
buster release, why not use testing instead of sid? Are you afraid stuff
starts moving to testing suddenly?
