Hi Jeremy et al.,

Oh, I don't know it's ever to late to improve something :)
Let me play devil's advocate for a secondâ€¦  Whilst I would agree
that uploading a package containing all the existing ones for an
addition might potentially be wasteful of mirror bandwidth, rsync &
friends would surely be clever enough to notice the the existing
tarballs were somewhat similarâ€¦
Moreover, human time and attention is orders of magnitude more costly
than bandwidth and, for example, a packaging bug in any individual
package is likely to be simply a bug in all them, and thus would
require tedious and error-prone duplication of effort to address across
50-odd packages.
Perhaps you have already encountered a sampling of that with the
handling these 31 ITPs, or even with quotidien tasks like updating
Standards-Version of the existing packages.
Providing cross-source scripts to automate such things, whilst
obviously possible, regrettably makes poor trade-offs IMHO in terms
of maintainability and unnecessarily increases the "bus factor" [0]
of the packaging, discouraging contributions.
And lastly, this is before we consider the aesthetic implications
on the source package namespace.  (ie. it's ugly as hell.)
Please re-consider? :)
