I'm always torn on this one.
I like pretty code, so I used <<- (which strips out leading TABs from
the here doc) so it will actually do the right thing as it is now.
However, it only takes someone that doesn't know about that subtlety to
carelessly edit the file and turn TABs into spaces to break things and
create a hard to notice bug, so perhaps I should have left the '-' and
the TABs out, as you suggest.
Cheers, Phil.
