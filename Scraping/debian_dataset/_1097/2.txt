Since ARCH is set through archdetect, and since archdetect.c (in
hw-detect) has this as final code:
        printf("%s/%s\n", CPU_TEXT, subarch);
â€¦ it seems to me we really should be checking for something like what
you're suggesting.
Would you be interested in helping test an image with this fix included?
I can build an amd64 netinst and upload that for your to try.
