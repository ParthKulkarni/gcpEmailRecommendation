Dear Andrey,
First of all thank you for responding.

That is a relief to know as I rely on reportbug and the BTS quite a bit

Hmm.. I was under the impression that DM or Debian Maintainers do not
have upload rights and only DD's have.
I am confused when I see packages such as
https://tracker.debian.org/news/896579/accepted-qbittorrent-403-1-source-amd64-into-unstable/
just to take as an example.
There have been few packages where I have been confused as well.
Now here it says -
Maintainer: Cristian Greco <cristian@debian.org>
Changed-By: Andrew Starr-Bochicchio <asb@debian.org>
now what role does or did Andrew play in the above. Is he the uploader
or just a reviewer of the work that Cristian Greco did ? Or is it some sort
of team-maintenance thing, not sure.
I do and did see that Cristian did upload some of the older package
releases but
now Andrew seems to be handling that part.

where would it show ?  Please share an example so I know what to look for.

I see two packages which have RFS against them in how-can-i-help
New packages waiting for sponsorship (reviews/tests are also useful):
 - logrotate - https://bugs.debian.org/884697 - RFS: logrotate/3.13.0-1 ITA
 - xml-core - https://bugs.debian.org/885641 - RFS: xml-core/0.18-1 [ITA]
but neither one of them shows up in tracker.debian.org .  I do see
that some people
have decided to adopt those packages which is good though.

Maybe I was not clear enough,  my concerns are not with the 'NEW' queue
i.e. $ aptitude search '~n' but for existing package updates also to have
the info. of package updates done but not yet in the archive in the
sidebar as well.
Maybe I should file a new bug ?

Simply, have a more effective feedback loop for know-how as to what's coming
while at the same time create less bit of noise in the BTS asking for
new point releases.
The only other recourse I know  is to traverse
https://incoming.debian.org/debian-buildd/pool/ and that isn't
user/human friendly as it's machine-friendly.
I hope I was able to clarify what I meant above.
