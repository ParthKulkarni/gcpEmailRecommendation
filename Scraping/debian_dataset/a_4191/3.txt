Well, limited upload rights is the only thing that DMs have that all other
people don't so I wonder what did you think they do.

All of them.

The Maintainer: field in .changes is copied from d/control and doesn't
mean anything else.
But why are you asking this? Both these people are DDs, not DMs, as can be
easily seen in their email adresses.

Why did you mention aptitude search '~n'?
"done but not yet in the archive" may mean anything, including a package
that exists only on the maintainer's machine. So I'm asking: what other
states do you want the tracker to support? Just RFSes?

That's not specific at all, sorry.

incoming is processed quite fast, you don't get much by knowing that a
package is there.
