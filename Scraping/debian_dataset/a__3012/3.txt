The policy on the wiki is phrased in terms of no functional differences,
and ideally no differences at all. Missing some man pages is a difference,
but hopefully not one that matters when satisfying dependencies.
(One interesting example of documentation being a functional
difference is that it's *technically* not right to omit gtk-doc
documentation from a package under the nodoc build profile, because
other packages with Build-Depends-Indep on that documentation can use
it to rewrite cross-references from web links into relative local file
references. Luckily most libraries that are documented with gtk-doc
build a separate -doc package for other reasons anyway, so that
package can easily be marked Build-Profiles: <!nodoc>.)

Yes. You've been in Debian longer than I have; surely you know by now
how much importance we put on policies? :-)
