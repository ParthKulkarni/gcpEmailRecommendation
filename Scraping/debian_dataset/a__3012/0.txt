Currently, the value of the Build-Depends field is just copied to the final
source package without making modifications. This is in contrast to the Depends
fields of the binary packages in debian/control which can get mangled depending
on their architecture annotations or substvars. What you propose would require
mangling the Build-Depends field at build-time which is a bad idea for several
reasons. Check out the following bugs:
