Yes, and in addition this information is recorded in both .changes
and .buildinfo files. I was initially among the ones wanting this
information in the .debs to be able to trace it, but the need
disappeared when we introduced .buildinfo files, because then we've
got the upload specific recording for the archive processor (.changes),
and the supposedly public facing record of what was done during the
build (.buildinfo), although the later can never be fully trusted
anyway. :)
