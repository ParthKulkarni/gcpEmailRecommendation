One thing I'd overlooked when scheduling binNMUs for d-i in preparation
for the point release is that there's been a kernel ABI change
(actually, two) in opu since the previous point release, so we will
need a source d-i upload after all.
KiBi: Is that an easy change? Is it one that you have time to deal with
currently?
Cheers,
