I don't think it's a matter of being doable or not, it certainly is.
I think it's a matter of whether this is correct or not. I think it
might be in extremely few cases, but in most it would be outright
wrong.
What this will end up doing is pushing dependencies for implementation
details towards far away transitive dependencies.
Whenever those implementation details change all those other packages
will need to be rebuilt, although this would still does not solve
artial upgrades.

I think in many cases those problems can be solved in other ways, of
course that might imply work, but they are still solvable in better
ways.
