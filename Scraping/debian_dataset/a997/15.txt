Well, I strongly disagree with you.  I think this would take things in the
wrong direction; I like that software is fully useful when Recommends are
enabled at the cost of some bloat.
If you don't want possibly unused software installed, we have a supported
mechanism for that: disable automatic installation of Recommends.
That said, it's certainly still fine to question individual choices, and
to request a downgrade to Suggests if the provided benefit is marginal.
