Sorry missed that question. I simply based my comment based on:
* https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#libraries
[...]
Any exception to this rule should be discussed on the mailing list
debian-devel@lists.debian.org, and the reasons for compiling with the
-fPIC flag must be recorded in the file README.Debian. [3]
[...]
Again I have no strong opinion on that. Having is set in the d/rules
is relatively clear. I just wanted to make it clear just like the
-fPIC flag.
