Well this is still such terrible policy, and even if there was consensual
agreement to deprecated the menu system it would also still be a terrible
transition plan. :( Worse so given that it was an imposed change from
the so called tech-ctte…
[ And just to make it explicit here in case people skip the thread
  refs below, I don't even use the menu system anymore on my systems! ]
Please see the thread starting at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2015/09/msg00040.html>
and continued at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy/2015/10/msg00000.html>.
At this point I guess the decision to cope fairly with such subpar and
imposed policy that a maintainer that has a package shipping both a
desktop file and a menu file is either to:
 - ignore it, very sadly violating policy, :( at least until there's
   a proper transition plan that does not leave users and WM/DE
   maintainers in the cold,
 - protest it, and still be policy compliant, by going the Solomonic
   route and removing both files.
Both options are very suboptimal, though. :(
