In September 2015 [0], the TC proposed a transition plan, in the form of 
points 3. & 4. :
>    3. We further resolve that "menu programs" should not depend on the
>    Debian Menu System and should instead rely on .desktop file

One "proper transition plan" has been proposed, and there was no visible 
result in almost two years; it's certainly sad that`xdg-menu` (from Arch, see 
[1]) has not been packaged; nor did our very own `menu` [2] receive enough 
love.
The other recourse was (well, still is) a GR, which hasn't happened either.
As I wrote back then [3] (and I haven't changed my mind) :

Also in [4]:

That would be stupid, to be blunt.
The next step is that this policy change is likely to find its way as a Lintian 
warning (or error). But we're still _very_ far from mass bug reports, without 
even talking about their severity (and several TC members indicated they were 
against 'serious' severity).
