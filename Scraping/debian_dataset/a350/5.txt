I definitely wasn't suggesting rewriting Debian, but about
automatically transforming existing Debian binary packages into
Flatpaks. This would also allow backporting apps to stable when it

Our solution here is AppArmour. It would be nice to see more of Qubes
(or Subgraph for that matter) in Debian though.
