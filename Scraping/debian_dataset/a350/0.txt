I am very much in favour of declarative maintainer scripts!
AFAIK, Niels Thykier has done a lot of work there, while Ralf
Treinen and colleagues are analysing maintainer scripts - they
even wrote a shell script parser, that is not a shell itself.
However, I would not try to see this work too much as means of
defense against malicious deb packages. This leads to a wrong,
non-achievable goal. I see it as a means to provide better
quality, predictable system state, and safety against bugs.
