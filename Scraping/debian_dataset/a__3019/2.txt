ca-certificates-udeb is blocked.
Please unblock the package ca-certificates to transition to testing.
We just downgraded the severity of a bug, since openssl was updated to 
fix an issue with the processing of CA certificates[0], in order to 
allow ca-certificates to transition to testing. The bug is intended to 
be closed after testing transition, just to be sure all is well, since 
the fix was really in openssl.
It appears that ca-certificates is now blocked due to udebs being 
frozen[1], as noted a couple days ago on d-d-announce (thank you for 
this note!).
Kind regards,
Michael Shuler
