Yes, I meant armhf.

Yes, but I can't think how better to label it.

No, I don't mean ppc64el. Â I looked at the published version of the
installation manual so I didn't see you already removed powerpc a few
hours earlier.
(Should non-release architectures really be removed completely from the
installation manual?  It seems like they should be excluded from the
published versions for stable and testing, but not removed altogether. 
 I don't know how difficult that would be to arrange.)
