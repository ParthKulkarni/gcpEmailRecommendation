That is not a valid assumption.  You have no way of knowing the device
behind /dev/shm.

Unless the operation is atomic there is a possibility it can be
interrupted.

It is not the same thing and it is based on several invalid/flawed
assumptions.

That doesn't make it correct code.  I spend most of my day in code bases
authored by other people.  I consistently find bugs that have been in
production, unreported, for 10 or more years.  A bug is still a bug when
it is found and identified, even if it has never manifested itself in
the real world.  If you doubt that, please review the recent news
surrounding the SPECTRE and MELTDOWN vulnerabilities.
