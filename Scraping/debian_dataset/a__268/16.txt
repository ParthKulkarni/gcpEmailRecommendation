Hmm, do you have tried to validate your shell code?
https://www.shellcheck.net/
I just pasted
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dashohoxha/pw/master/src/pw.sh into
and got quite a lot of problematic remarks.
Have you test cases to prevent things Philipp has raised?
The concerns Philipp mentioned are valid, creating safe shell code isn't
easy and writing correct syntax isn't enough.
Your ITP about password managing isn't the first of course, as far I can
remember the common sense was that using Bash or any other Shell isn't
the best choice for doing things like this.
