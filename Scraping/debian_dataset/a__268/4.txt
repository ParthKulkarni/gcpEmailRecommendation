As much as I would have liked to not reply, but alas, another ad hominem.
The result of tar is not checked, no. The result of gpg is checked. I
think the case I'm worried about is a race on ~/.pw/pw.tgz where between
archive_unlock and archive_lock pw.tgz is set - say - 0400 and tar fails
to write.
That said, because you are so much into proofs:

But as soon as tar writes incomplete output (which it totally can, it's
a Tape ARchiver) you have silent corruption.
