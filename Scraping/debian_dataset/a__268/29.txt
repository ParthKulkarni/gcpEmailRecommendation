Package: wnpp
Severity: wishlist
Closes: #903814
Description:
  A simple command-line password manager that keeps passwords inside a
  gpg encrypted tgz archive. The content of the archive is a directory tree
  with a file for each password entry. The first line of the file is the
  password, and the rest can optionally be additional or related info.
  It provides commands for manipulating the passwords, allowing the user
  to add, remove, edit, generate passwords etc.
Repository: https://github.com/dashohoxha/pw
Documentation: http://dashohoxha.github.io/pw/man/
This program started by forking 'pass': http://www.passwordstore.org/
I sugessted a few changes to it, which were not accepted, so I forked
it and made further changes and improvements, until it became a
completely different program.
