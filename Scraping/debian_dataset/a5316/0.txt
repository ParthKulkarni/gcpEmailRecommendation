I would strongly discourage moving from ucf management to dpkg conffiles in
the first place.  That's a regression in the user experience; the
inflexibilities of conffile handling are well known and interest has been
expressed on debian-dpkg in integrating ucf-like options into dpkg itself. 
I don't see any reason why, when someone has gone to the effort of
implementing ucf support for a given config file, you would ever want to
revert to conffile handling instead.
And dropping ucf handling is certainly not required for addressing Policy
4.1.3 compatibility, which is what you mention in the changelog.
Why do you think it's necessary here to revert to a conffile?
