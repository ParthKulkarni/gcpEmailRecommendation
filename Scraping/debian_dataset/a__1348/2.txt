As Far As I Can See  is the "append" where the trouble starts.
What happened is that /etc/default/keyboard got twice XKBOPTIONS
I think it is fair that dpkg-reconfigure only updates one XKBOPTIONS
Correct workflow would be that the manual "append" 
would change "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
in "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp:caps:none".
So that /etc/default/keyboard contains 1 line with XKBOPTIONS being
XKBOPTIONS="terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp:caps:none"
before dpkg-reconfigure is called.
I don't know if it is valid option,
thing I'm trying to tell is that original "append" is wrong in my eyes.
Hope this helps.
