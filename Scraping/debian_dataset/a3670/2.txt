Hi,
Just to let people know: Recently, there has been quite some spam with
identical content sent to different bugs, project and team mailing
lists, etc. That's bad, but what's even more worse is that this spam now
gets send to nnn-done@bugs.d.o (see [1] for an example), in fact closing
bug reports.
Just pointing this out here to make people aware and (maybe) to discuss
what could be done regarding this.
All the best,
Georg
