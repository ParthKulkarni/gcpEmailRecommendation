Yes.

I think that the right thing for `update-rc.d defaults-disabled' is to
do this:
 1. check to see if any links already exist
      if they do, do nothing else
 2. parse the init script to find the default-start and default-stop
      runlevels
 3. run
      insserv add DAEMON,stop=RLVL,RLVL,....
    (for the complete set of start and stop runlevels)
After this, the script is run for `stop' in each of those runlevels,
roughly like update-rc.d disable would do (the sequence numbers will
briefly not be identical, until insserv is re-run).
Better would be to add a feature to insserv to do (2) and (3) in one
go, but if we were to do that it should probably gain the
functionality in update-rc.d's sysv_toggle too.
