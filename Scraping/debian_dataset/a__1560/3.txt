Can you elaborate? My own experience is limited and I have the feeling
that it's largely operated by CÃ©dric Krier acting like a benevolent
dictator for life. But still it's much better than any other similar
project in this scope that I know of. I have been able to contribute my
changes and I even got commit rights on a module (account_fr).

But it is highly valued here in Debian and by the many tryton users out
there.

Again, can you elaborate and be more specific?

I am mainly using your backports, yes.
