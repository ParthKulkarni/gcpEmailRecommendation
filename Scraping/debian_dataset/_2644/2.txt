Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.79
Severity: critical
Justification: breaks the whole system
Dear Maintainer,
I have been running Debian on a QNAP TS109 for many years.
I successfully upgraded from Squeeze to Wheezy in 2013 and to Jessie in 2015.
As I now upgrade to Stretch (basically following Debian Upgrade Guide, it
is a very simple system) I now get:
== from apt-get dist-upgrade ==
update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-4.9.0-5-marvell
flash-kernel: installing version 4.9.0-5-marvell
The initial ramdisk is too large. This is often due to the unnecessary inclusion
of all kernel modules in the image. To fix this set MODULES=dep in one or both
/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/driver-policy (if it exists) and
/etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf and then run 'update-initramfs -u
-k 4.9.0-5-marvell'
Not enough space for initrd in MTD 'RootFS1' (need 4210887 but is
actually 4194304).
run-parts: /etc/initramfs/post-update.d//flash-kernel exited with return code 1
dpkg: error processing package initramfs-tools (--configure):
 subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
 initramfs-tools
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
== end of output
That was (obviously) after
 - editing /etc/apt/sources.list (changing jessie to stretch)
 - apt-get update
 - apt-get upgrade
I am completely aware how old and obsolete this QNAP TS109 is.
It would make complete sense to me if it was not supported anymore.
And I would completely understand if you dont want to fix this problem.
But given that TS-109 appears supported
  http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/ts-109/install/
and with no major issues
  http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/ts-109/known-issues/
I would not expect this problem well into the upgrade.
To other users, it would be helpful to advice them not to upgrade to Stretch.
I guess my system would reboot if I try (but I have not tried)
I guess Debain 9.3 can run with Linux 3.16.0-5-orion5x from Debian 8, but
to me (I have used Debian for 20 years) the system seems to be in a rather
bad state. (if it fails to boot a serial cable for direct UBOOT is necessary)
I have not tried editing
  /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
I suppose i could try to change MODULES=most to MODULES=dep.
However, if I break the system completely it will be much harder for me
to give you any more useful information.
  Best Regards
  Gunnar Thorburn
