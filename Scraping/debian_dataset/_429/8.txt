Hello,
Thanks for the work on this; it will make things on (at minimum) the
Ubuntu side of things much, much better and will hopefully ensure higher
quality Debian packages.

What are the added delays as of today, and is this effective immediately?

What is the reasoning for not making these blocking sooner? In my honest
opinion, passing autopkgtests should be a release migration requirement,
and not just with my Ubuntu hat on (because it has a correlation to
higher quality packages).
Thanks,
