I doubt this. ifupdown has no entry in apt.extended_states.1.gz, and
netbase was upgraded from 5.3 during the same upgrade process. There
was no upgrade process before this which might have been continued.
Apart, auto-removal I think is specifically identified and should
also not happen on "upgrade" cf. manpage, no?
