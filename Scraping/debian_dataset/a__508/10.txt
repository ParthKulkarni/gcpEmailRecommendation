Dear David,
Thank you for your witty response, and your work on APT. I mean it.
I am quite sure you get a lot of diverging requests and then one
like mine, without version numbers, logs, but CAPITAL LETTERS
instead.
While your points are spot-on, and I especially liked "this is
a proposal, not a EULA", I've been using APT since one of its first
versions, and I think "upgrade" has existed from the early days with
precisely the promise that, unlike "dist-upgrade", it would not
modify the set of installed packages, either way. Thence stems my
habit to run "apt-get upgrade" without reading the "proposal",
unlike when I run "dist-upgrade" or "install"/"remove"/"purge"
instead.
So I hope you understand that the confusion when I saw what had
happened. Fortunately, the damage wasn't so bad, but just imagine
this had happened via an SSH connection on a machine without console
accessâ€¦
Now for your input:
> I am not opposed to the possibility of bugs in apt in general, but
> the amount of "upgrade with removal"-bugs which all turned out to
> be either scrollback-confusion, aliases or wrapper scripts is

I sixtuple-checked as per your instructions and can confirm that the
apt-get I invoked was /usr/bin/apt-get from apt==1.0.9.8.4 and there
were no aliases or wrapper scripts involved. I checked this, but
I also purposely never have any of those when logged in as root.
I am not sure what you mean with scrollback-confusion. I mean, APT
told me it'd remove the packages, which I didn't see, and so when
I agreed, it removed them. And I recovered, and that's not a big
deal, but it shouldn't have put the packages up for removal in the
first place. And I cannot come up with a case where it should have
done that.

I'm now taking this to a bug report:

Oh, the cynicismâ€¦ ;)
Don't worry, I won't take your bait. This is a headless madchine in
a remote datacentre running 24/7. There's KVM access, fortunately.
I just need it to come up with its static IPs on every boot and
ifupdown has been doing a fantastic job for years with that.

This still made my day. â™¥
