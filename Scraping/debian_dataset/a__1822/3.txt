What you say is obviously wrong, and you should know that if you follow
devuan.
Even the founder of Devuan regularly uses exactly the words Ansgar
described.
Chris Lamb not to long ago was target of those conspiracy theories and
hate mails (search for redis on their mailing list) if you don't believe me.
Personally I'm happy that the Devuan people moved to their own place as
debian-devel and debian-user became bearable again.
