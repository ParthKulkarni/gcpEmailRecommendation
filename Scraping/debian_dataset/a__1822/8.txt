it's my first time writing to this ML, which calls for a quick
hello/intro and the FYI that I intended to send:
The quick hello/intro:
I go on the internet by Evilham and have been using Debian for ages.
When it was time for me to give back to the community, systemd and
Devuan were both already a thing, and things ended up bringing me to
help Devuan first.
The FYI:
Devuan is not blind to this topic or reticent to contributing in Debian,
the discussion is indeed taking place over at devuan-dev and, without
having discussed it thoroughly yet, many are of the opinion that it *is*
in everyone's best interest to keep the packages in Debian, and in a
good state.

At least personally speaking, there is interest in helping Debian from
Devuan, as most of us see that there is big benefit in both distros.
However, as you are aware, maintaining a distro is a lot of work (BTW:
thank you all for your contribution to Debian), there have been
priorities other than supervising state of packages in Debian.
I don't think many were aware of the state of things and that this was
the path these (very critical) packages were following in Debian.
Where to now?
At devuan-dev, Adam Sampson has suggested that the debian-bsd and
debian-hurd communities are also very interested in keeping non-systemd
things working, which is why I'd hope this won't end up in non-systemd
support being dropped, but that this thread becomes the distress call
that the topic needed.
If I had to guess, this requires some organisation first, and since it
may require cross-communities organisation it may be somewhat tricky.
From Devuan's side, there is a weekly meeting happening on (UTC)
Wednesday evening, where this will surely be a big topic.
Just letting you know, things are moving (albeit somewhat late and slowly).
Best regards,
