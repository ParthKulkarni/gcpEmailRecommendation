Let me see how some actual Devuan developers think about systemd:

As a lazy person I was just grepping for "cancer" in the mail archive
and picked a few examples.  Too lazy to search for other insults.
I'm not alone in seeing this as a problem in the Devuan community.  A
certain Martin Steigerwald pointed out:

Tolerating this *does* reflect back on project leaders, more so if some
of them also engage in the behavior.
Debian already had a systemd maintainer step back because of abuse from
a certain group of people[1].  As I would like to see systemd still
maintained in the future, I don't think it's worth to try to integrate
the abusers in Debian as package maintainers.
Given that the systemd maintainers also have to deal with sysvinit,
maintainership of sysvinit is probably especially problematic.

See above for a few examples.

Dunno, I saw it used by IRC channel operators.  I would assume that IRC
channel ops are not totally unrelated people...

Ah, one of the people calling systemd a cancer. Great.
