Hi Xavier,
thanks for doing this, it looks awesome :).
Would it make sense to split this into a Gitlab part and a Salsa only 
part? There are already a number of Gitlab tools (even in Debian) and 
commands like search_user sound rather generic, so maybe it would make 
sense to add them to those tools instead (I haven't checked if they 
provide similar commands already).
Speaking of it, I'm still looking for a hub like tool for Gitlab, most 
of the time I only need hub fork and hub pull-request. Is there a tool 
in Debian with this functions for Gitlab?
(If you don't spit the salsa tool as proposed above, this would be a 
nice addition. That's why I ask here.)
