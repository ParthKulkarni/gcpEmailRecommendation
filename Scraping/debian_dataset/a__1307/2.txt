Huh? This doesn't make any sense. You are creating a symlink named "awk" that
points to itself. And you will have broken everything.
The problem is the lack of /usr/bin/awk because that file is handled by
update-alternatives which can't be run in the early steps. So it's
manually created and it needs to point to the awk alternative that
has been unpacked earlier.
At best you can try to match /usr/bin/*awk to try to guess how the
awk executable is named and use that to look up the package name
(for the x_core_install call that also hardcodes the mawk name)
and create the appropriate symlink (which will get replaced by
the update-alternatives managed one).
Cheers,
