I think you are confusing netinst with netboot.
A netboot installer image is an initramfs with input, graphics and
network drivers included, but not storage drivers.  It downloads
additional installer components from the network, not from local
storage.
A netinst installer image is a disk image.  It includes one or more
boot loaders, kernels, and initramfses; and additional installer
components.  The initramfs additionally includes storage drivers.
If the netboot method doesn't work for you (maybe network auto-
configuration doesn't work properly in this VPS?) you could try
extracting the kernel (vmlinuz) and initramfs (initrd.img) from the
netinst installer image and providing those instead of the netboot
images.
