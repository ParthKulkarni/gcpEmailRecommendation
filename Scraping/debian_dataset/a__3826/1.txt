Thanks Ben.
After a bit more research, I figured the stretch 'mini.iso' from the
netboot tree might do the job, since it downloads everything and doesn't
need to read the CD after boot.
That did appear to work - but the resulting system unfortunately didn't
boot. I suspect that has more to do with the way the VPS is set up,
though - I don't think the grub that's trying to boot it is the same one
that I installed, and it got confused, giving me an Error 14, something
to do with a file too big to read. Grub legacy trying to read grub2
stuff perhaps? Anyway, probably off-topic here.
Thanks,
Richard
