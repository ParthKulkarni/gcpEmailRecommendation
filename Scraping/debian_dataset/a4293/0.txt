I'm not sure this is the same issue we fixed a few days ago:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/debian-installer.git/commit/?id=e59da9cf6fe9608102182b596aca9e7fababd8d3
but this is likely. I first thought it affected a specific platform, but
that's actually the common partition.img.gz which is too small?
If you have a chance of trying again with Stretch final images, that
would be helpful.
