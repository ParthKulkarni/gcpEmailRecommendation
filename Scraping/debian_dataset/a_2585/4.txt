Hello everyone,
Recently, ALL the packages that I maintain based on Qt, have problems
of reproducibility on build on i386.
The message is always the same: 
/usr/lib/qt5/bin/uic: error while loading shared libraries:
libQt5Core.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory [0].
I'm missing something? libQt5Core is a dependency that must be
installed when the qtbase5-dev packages depend.
Regards!
I. De Marchi
