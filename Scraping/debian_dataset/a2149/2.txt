Hi,

Yeah, sorry about that. It took us a bit of time to get every detail
sorted out, and a few renames/re-migration happened.

Yeah, with the error message you quoted, checking projects associated
with a given team might have helped you figure out the correct/new name
on your own, but I see how this can be confusing.

FWIW with git, just updating the remote might be sufficient, instead of
cloning everything again. But as I said, I think we re-run the migration
scripts a few times, so maybe the current repository has a different set
of branches/history compared to your clone. Updating the remote's URL
might be worth a try though. ;)
Sorry for the inconvience, and feel free to keep me in the loop (through
a personal cc) in case you still have issues with committing, we'll try
to fix it up ASAP.
Cheers,
