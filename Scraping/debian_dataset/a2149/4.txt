Ah, something comes to mind:
The repository for the d-i-manual has been moved to another path on salsa,
it now resides as "installation-guide" (it's correct name):
https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/installation-guide
So you have an outdated checkout, which no longer works.
You need to do a new git clone from
git@salsa.debian.org:installer-team/installation-guide.git
