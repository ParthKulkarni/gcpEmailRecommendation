Control: retitle -1 busybox-static: always prefers applets when chrooting
This is desired behaviour for the busybox-static package, and I can't
think of any documentation changes that could make this clearer.
For the benefit of others who may stumble across this bug:
The standard and preferred package for use on a standard Debian system
is 'busybox'. 'busybox-static' will also work just as well inside the
initramfs, but is designed to be used as a rescue tool if fundamental
components of your system, such as your C library, as broken.
To facilitate this busybox-static always prefers to run its own applets,
including dpkg, rather than the system-supplied binaries; if your system
is sufficiently broken that you are running busybox ash, it's a safe
assumption that your system tools are also hosed.
Thanks,
Chris
