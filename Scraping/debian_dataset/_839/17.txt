Done. See my previous mail.

#878518 is fixed in lintian/2.5.56.

I intend to perform said MBF in one week and this mail serves as the MBF
announcement. I will use the following mail template:

Subject: %(package)s should depend on e2fsprogs
Package: %(package)s
Version: %(version)s
User: helmutg@debian.org
Usertags: nonessentiale2fsprogs
Dear maintainer,
We want to make removing e2fsprogs from installations possible. For standard
installations this is not useful, but embedded applications and chroots benefit
from such an option.  For getting there all packages that use e2fsprogs must be
identified and gain a dependency on it as e2fsprogs currently is essential.
%(package)s was identified as potentially needing such a dependency,
because it mentions tool names from e2fsprogs in the following files:
%(report)s
Please investigate whether these cases are actually uses of a tool from
e2fsprogs. Care has been taken to shrink the number of candidates as much as
possible, but a few false positives will remain. After doing so, do one of the
following:
 * Add e2fsprogs to Depends.
 * Add e2fsprogs to Recommends.
 * Close this bug explaining why e2fsprogs is not used by this package.
Once e2fsprogs drops the "Essential: yes" flag, this bug will be upgraded to RC
severity. Please note that lintian will warn about such a dependency before
lintian 2.5.56.
Thanks for your help
Helmut

For a dd-list, affected packages and the report details, see my previous
mail. I will update the data using a fresh analysis run before
submitting bugs.
Please object now.

Later, but I hope we can do it in time for buster.
