I think describint that as `effort' is rather much.

You should rely on users to report bugs.

Obviously it would be better to make ti work with cron.  Ideally it
would go into cron.daily which I assume works with systemd too.
But if you do just the systemd thing, I think if someone sends you a
patch to make it work with cron I think you should accept and carry
that patch.
