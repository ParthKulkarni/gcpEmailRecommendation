I don't understand. If I submit a merge request to the maintainer, it's 
on me to test what I submit actually works. So if I add stuff for a 
completely different init system I have to test it. The question is: Is 
the package buggy if it does not contain an init script but a systemd 
unit and it seems to be the case. Note that there are a *lot* of useful 
options in a systemd unit that would need emulation to make properly 
work with sysvinit.
Okay. In this case I contributed to the package of someone else and 
don't want to make it buggy.
It'd need to run much more often (every 15 minutes). So cron.daily 
wouldn't fit. For the sake of the argument it'd need to be a shell 
script that checks multiple conditions (see [1]). And we currently don't 
have timer/cron deduplication, unfortunately. That means it'd also need 
to disable itself on systemd systems (but of course cron would still 
invoke the script periodically). Similarly - as a more general remark - 
having it as a cronjob doesn't let you monitor it in quite the same way.
In this case that might be feasible because if it breaks that user is 
hopefully going to monitor it anyway, because it's a monitoring thing. 
But there is a cost to carrying such things (such as cron confusingly 
invoking something whose output isn't used at all because it's going to 
be short circuited at startup).
