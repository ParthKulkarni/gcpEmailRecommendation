I already did, in my email. Maybe not a "security problem" that is going 
to get a CVE, but I don't think people realize users of other accounts 
can read their files. I doubt this is understood when a separate account 
is created.
If windows is different, it looks to be the outlier because macOS 
behaves the same way as Debian[0]:
I was only referencing Windows and Mac in case their was an assumption 
that Linux users are knowledgeable enough to change umask/permissions 
(and to even know about them). I was not (and do not know) what Windows 
and/or Mac umask/permissions are (or if they have them at all).
