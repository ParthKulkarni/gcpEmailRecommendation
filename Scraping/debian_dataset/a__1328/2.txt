Not really. More precisely I don't know what is the status now.
What I have observed a number of times within the last 2 years is that
linux containers with systemd where not working for my needs. The
solution was two switch to sysvinit and forget about the problem.
According to this [0] the issue might be fixed but I have not tested it
so far.
In any case I think it is important to keep sysvinit scripts unless
there is a good reason not to.
