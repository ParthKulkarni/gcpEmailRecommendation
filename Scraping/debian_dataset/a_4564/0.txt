FWIW if I have chosen to configure a terminal with a light coloured 
background, I also configure the standard ANSI colours so that there will be 
sufficient contrast to read them against my chosen background. That usually 
means increasing saturation and decreasing lightness for the colours. The 
dpkg-source warning you showed appears as a brownish colour and is perfectly 
legible for me.
cheers
