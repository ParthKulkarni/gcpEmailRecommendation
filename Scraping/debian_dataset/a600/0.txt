elogind is an isolated part extracted from systemd-logind, maintained by Void
people, and in use by several other distributions (Gentoo, Devuan, etc).  It
is a drop-in replacement for interfaces exposed by libpam-systemd.
I'm using it for several months myself, and intended to package it in
Debian, but had a lack of tuits to do so.
I just started a new job and I think I'll have a small but non-zero amount
of tuits in the evenings, but havent't finished moving and can't comfortably
run anything that needs reasonable VMs (got nothing but a Pinebook with me),
so I can't be of much help -- but if anyone wants to start the work on
elogind, I'll try to do what I can.

The main problem with sysvinit is the lack of a git repository.  There's a
massive amount of opportunities for drive-by contributions, but no way to
collaborate doing so.
Then, there are nice-looking new upstream releases of sysvinit (three in
this year, after several years of dormancy), but that'd require some real
testing.  Unlike elogind, it could perhaps reasonably be tested remotely...
