The idea here is to record facts about the system where a package was
built. Building in a merged-/usr system does not necessarily produce a
broken package. Not building in a chroot is also not necessarily a
problem, but still, we want to know that.
Now, as Andrey points out, nowdays a chroot is not the only type of
minimal system where one can build packages, so maybe a more
sophisticated check would be required.
