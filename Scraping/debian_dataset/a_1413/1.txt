Oi you lot!
I wonder, would it be better if we switched to using the word "depender" in
place of "reverse dependency"?  It certainly sounds clumsier, but it is far
less likely to be confused, especially by new readers.  I myself often find
sentences which include references to both depends and reverse depends quite
hard to parse.
Meow!
