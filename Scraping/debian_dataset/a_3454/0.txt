Have there been any cases where those files have been in the
upstream VCS ? I don't recall any such case.
For the case where certain parts shouldn't be built/shipped due to
policy, this can - and IMHO should - be handled with changes within
the VCS, instead of having tarballs laying around w/o any clear
history and no indication how exactly it was created from upstream.
Actually, since about a decade, I'm not doing any code changes outside
git, and I'm building packages only directly from git. Frankly, I don't
see any reason why that can't be the standard case.
