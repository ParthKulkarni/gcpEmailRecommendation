Yes that is a very strong fact in favour of sbuild.

I was thinking of things like 'dash' which are pedantically POSIX compliant, serve to find
bugs in other scripts/shells but are not themselves recommended for end-user use (at least
interactively)

Fair enough, cowbuilder was one of the ones in my hazy peripheral vision as
"another", along with some tools to use things like docker that I am aware of
but couldn't remember the names. None of them have the same traction as
pbuilder or sbuild. I've only used pbuilder myself personally.

The points you have made are a valuable contribution IMHO, thanks for making them.
