Found in the Alpha 1 release annoucement:

I understand it as: Network interfaces will be named using their
firmware/BIOS name, or their physical location, or using a static
mapping (as before). This won't depend on the discoveriong order. This
won't apply for the upgrade. 
(I see it as the /dev/hdXY -> UUID transition)

Reading it (thanks for the link), I see that mac-adress naming is
available but not used. So network interfaces will have unusual name,
but not as exotic as this!
>IIUC your text is stating that the eth0 scheme will be default?
I try to say the opposite!
