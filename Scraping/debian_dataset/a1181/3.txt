I think there are at least 2 kinds of "extras":
1. Stuff that's currently being developed but isn't part of the core desktop
2. Deprecated and/or unmaintained stuff like the reverse-depends of
src:libgnome which the Debian GNOME team would like to remove from
Debian, but it's a bit hard to remove stuff that apparently still
works for someone.
Some example of #1 that aren't in Debian yet are glom (hosted on GNOME
infrastructure but otherwise not really considered part of GNOME) and
lollypop (hosted on GitHub).
GNOME Shell extensions could be maintained with the same team as GTK+
themes although they are only usable in one desktop but the themes are
cross-desktop.

I was expecting to probably just use collab-maint git for now. The
packaging hosting wasn't as big of a concern to me as the Maintainer
field for a new packaging team (which is being discussed in multiple
threads on debian-devel now).
Thanks,
