Hi,
I've just checked the list you provided below with what's in my local
copy, deployed with .mrconfig:
Steve McIntyre <steve@einval.com> (2018-04-26):
> bak.debootstrap
=> deleted as mentioned earlier.
> d-i
=> can go away (alioth generated for all git-based projects)?
> daily-build-logs
=> repository is likely corrupted, not sure it's recoverable; it might
   make sense to scratch it since its main purpose is to make it easy
   to find what broke when daily builds regress. Most useful short term
   anyway, IMHO.
> kadit-playbooks
> kadit
=> both not mentioned on purpose
So I think we're (almost) good here.
Cheers,
