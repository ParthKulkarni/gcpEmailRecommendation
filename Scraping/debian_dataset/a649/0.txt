If anybody would like to play with this, I've just uploaded it to
https://salsa.debian.org/93sam/d-i-test1
and I'll leave it up there for now.

To make things go much faster, I grabbed a copy of the svn repo
directly and I've been running with that. It goes *much* more quickly
due to the latency reduction on each revision checkout, but it
reliably fails with:
Name does not refer to a filesystem directory: Failure opening
'/trunk/installer/build/pkg-lists/netboot/mipsel/sb1-swarm-bn.cfg':
'/trunk/installer/build/pkg-lists/netboot/mipsel' is not a directory
in filesystem '48c42b26-1dd6-0310-b98f-a58d8bce7237' at
/usr/share/perl5/Git/SVN/Ra.pm line 312
at r35516. Joy. I've not modified the svn data files in any way, and
this worked from alioth...
Having looked online, I find various recommendations to avoid using
this version of svn2git (which is a simple wrapper around
git-svn). I'm now trying the svn2git tool the KDE people used for
migration:
