Hi,
I am unable to clearsign a file with gpg, always getting
permission denied errors.
However it does not tell me which is the file where permissions
are missing.
I checked all files I am aware of:
- the file to sign, 
- all files in .gnupg and the .gnupg dir itself,
They are all fine.
How can I find out, which file is the problem?
 
Or maybe it is not a file, which makes the error, but a missing
permission for a process or .... ?
Holger
