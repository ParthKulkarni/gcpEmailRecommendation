Hi Simon,

Yes. Correct. Supplemented by an extra-fancy-widgets library called  
"ayatana-ido" (src:pkg) forked from Ubuntu's "ido" (indicator display

GTK-3 SNI applications, yes. In Qt5, there must be something similar.  
Natively in Qt5, I guess. I should know more about this. Maybe someone  
with Qt5 insights can provide additional info.
Side note: Please forget libindicate, it is about to be dead. It was  
used to send new-message-notifications between applications and the  
indicator-messages system indicator. Handles otherwise nowadays.
Little porting, for renderers only. SNI applications don't directly  
depend on lib(ayatana)-indicator.
Porting an SNI application from libappindicator to  
libayatana-appindicator implicitly ports it from libindicator to  
libayatana-indicator.
Nope. The libindicate library can be dropped completely.  
Implementations can simply be removed from applications, the  
libindicate code path was used to notify (ayatana-)indicator-messages  
about new events having occurred in communication applications (new  
email, new chat post, etc.).
Some little source code porting is needed. My goal was to allow  
parallel installation of lib(app)indicator and  
libayatana-(app)indicator.

More complex patch: support building against libappindicator and  
libayatana-appindicator alike (available shared libs decides what to  
build against):
nm-applet:  
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?att=1;bug=880169;filename=network-manager-applet_1.8.4-1%2Bayatanaindicator.debdiff;msg=10
Even more complex; choose what indicator implementation to use by  
configure option (a renderer, though):
The nice part of AppIndicator shared lib: if no SNI provider is  
running on a desktop, xembed gets used. (Very helpful on my favourite  
desktop shell i3). So, as application developer, you can drop your own  
xembed code, switch to Ayatana AppIndicator and get the xembed  
fallback for free.
Only disadvantage: application indicators don't have a right-click  
menu, only a left-click or just-click menu. Also in xembed fallback  
mode.
Ah, ok. I see. This is painful, but alas. The xembed approach is  
really on its verge of extinction. However, when Ubuntu dropped xembed  
support in 12.10, I think it was, there was quite some noise going  
through the community.
PS: I will be nearly 100% afk over Easter, but don't hesitate to ask  
more questions / provide ideas for the transition management. I'll get  
back to your emails on Tuesday.
