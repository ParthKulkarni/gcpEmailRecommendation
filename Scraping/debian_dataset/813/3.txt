That's great indeed. Funny enough, tobi, me and some others discussed
this very topic at the 34c3 Debian meeting and came up with the idea to
add groups functionality to tracker.debian.org. It's awesome to learn
that it already exists :)
Is there a way to have a qa.debian.org overview over a tracker group?
The tracker group page looks quite empty, it doesn't provide any
overview about the packages themselves except their names.
Besides: Is it possible to send mail to
'desktop-themes-team@tracker.debian.org'? Where does it get forwarded?
All addresses in uploaders fields of associated packages?
I still think we should have an way to state that a group is the actual
maintainer of the package *in* the Maintainer field of the package.
Giving a group email address whould here would have the advantage that
our package overview web tools (packages, tracker, qa, ...) would link
to the group page automatically, right?

Phew, shall we really support that? I think we should stick to debbugs
as our single (public) bug tracker. It would be quite confusing if some
packages would use one bug tracker and others another one.
