I don't think there is much to gain from it. Whenever there is a change
in the major version of gcc/g++ many bugs show up and all involved
really do a great job fixing these. IMHO switching from an older C++
standard to a newer one is no different. In fact, I think that this
forced change is an excellent incentive to review older packages.

Why would you pick such an old standard as the default? Also note that
at least with boost there were instances where the ABI changed
depending on whether C++11 or higher was enabled or not. - Also for
that reason I think we should strife for all packages using the same
C++ standard, and this should be the default of the currently used C++
compiler. Forcing a lower standardÂ on a package as a maintainer I would
consider only as a (temporal) workaround to fix RC bugs, and preferable
only for leaf packages.
