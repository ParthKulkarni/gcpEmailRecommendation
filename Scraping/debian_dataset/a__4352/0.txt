  Description     : a simple formatter for /proc/mounts
Since the advent of more and more pseudo-file systems the output of
mount became confusing and the information important for everyday life
was difficult to read out.
lsmount gives you a much more readable output of /proc/mounts with
optional colorizing, alignment and more useful options.
I plan to maintain the package myself with the help of a supporter.
