/dev and /run{,/lock,/shm} are oh so useful to be listed... (unless they
take a non-negligible amount of space, which is an error that's good to know
of).
Likewise, why are /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 both listed elebenty times?  No
matter how many subvolumes I have, they're all on the same physical
filesystem thus have the same amount of free space.
I even wrote a series of patches for dfc fixing this and other issues
(https://github.com/kilobyte/dfc/commits/master) but they haven't been
accepted by upstream.
Thus, if your tool has an option duplicating dfc and deduplicating
filesystems, I'd use it for this reason.
Meow!
