Actually, I've done the build just to be sure what I'm uploading does build.
But I'm doing a source-only upload, I'm uploading only the _sources.changes
that pbuilder requests generating (with SOURCE_ONLY_CHANGES=yes in
.pbuilderrc), but the build does produce and _amd64.changes too (which I don't
touch).
