I hope that ftpmasters will reply here, but just in case:
[08:06:05] (ansgar): Corsac: I fixed it by changing the filename and resigning
the buildd's changes.Â Â But please don't uploadÂ _amd64.buildinfo unless you include amd64 binaries.
I didn't manually generate this _sources.changes and I didn't ask to include
_amd64.buildinfo. So something does need fixing in the build chain, whether
it's pbuilder, debhelper or dpkg-dev or a combination thereof.
