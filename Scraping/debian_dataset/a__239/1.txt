reallyâ€¦  that's just a ftp-master issue IMHO, definitely not due to
debhelper much less by pbuilderâ€¦

That's kind of OT, but:
Not yet.  We people from the reproducible team couldn't find a way to
usefully talk to ftp-masters people, whom never replied to any of the
questions in the thread at #763822 (they only did some quick comments on
IRC, and we have been left on guessing what they would likeâ€¦).
Anyhow, .buildinfo files are stored in ftp-master, just not exported to
the mirrors, you can find them in
coccia.debian.org:/srv/ftp-master.debian.org/<something>.
