Pruning accordingly (I'm not sure why the mails were sent there in the
first place).

So I suppose we talk about 13 GB[1] of static content in about 1.7M
files. Is that something that could be distributed through
static.debian.org if there are concerns around inodes for the main
mirrors? Given that they would be accessed mostly rarely[2]?

[1] 7.7kB (75%ile as mentioned in the referenced bug) * 55000 binary
packages * 10 architectures * 3 versions - so quite conservatively
[2] So supposedly a CDN wouldn't bring a lot of benefit as individual
files aren't likely to be hit frequently.
