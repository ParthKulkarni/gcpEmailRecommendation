Git is an interesting thought for incremental mirroring. But then it

What I think should be a requirement is that the data is pushed out 
before the mirror pulse. Otherwise you end up with a race where you try 
to mirror the data including the buildinfo but can't access it. (It's a 
little unfortunate that we don't simply put them onto the mirrors.
Kind regards
