We had a related conversation on debian-dpkg recently.
There were some reasons discussed why publishing the uploader's
_ARCH.buildinfo, even of a source-only upload, may be useful to some
people.
However, given that the autobuilder's _ARCH.buildinfo actually
corresponds to the published binaries, that clearly must take
precedence.
So I think publishing the uploader's .buildinfo for
built-but-unpublished binaries requires being able to store and
reproduce multiple .buildinfo files for a single ARCH.

Separately, we discussed the nature of _source.buildinfo.  Currently
dpkg-genchanges will generate a _source.buildinfo if asked to make a
source-only .changes file.  I think this is usually wrong.
(And the fact that build-dependencies might affect the generated
_source package_ is a bug in our source code management systems.)
Perhaps we need to invent the concept of _source+ARCH.buildinfo or
something.
