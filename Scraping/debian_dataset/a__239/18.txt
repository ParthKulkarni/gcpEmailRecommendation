I had a quick look at the (currently) 4 systems behind static.d.o and
it looks like they can all take the extra space and inodes. senfter
only has 48GB space left but we can expand the storage there.
mirror-csail only has 64M inodes available, but should be fine.
One concern might be the rsync time for 1.7M inodes, I'm not sure if
our static setup does sites in parallel.
There might be other factors here that I'm not aware of, hopefully
other DSA folks can fill them in.
Are these files going to only be available for the versions of packages
that exist in the archive right now, or is it going to be a historical
archive of all Debian build information forever?
paralel
What kind of growth per year are we expecting?

Some patches to files in dsa-puppet to define the service:
modules/roles/manifests/static_mirror.pp
modules/roles/misc/static-components.yaml
modules/roles/templates/static-mirroring/vhost/static-vhosts-simple.erb
modules/sudo/files/sudoers

It strikes me as quite a lot of data for one git repo :)
