That makes more sense.  So this oddness with different (and
partially-overlapping) changes files is something pbuilder has done,
perhaps accidentally.
I find myself agreeing with Thorsten:
   I think it's best that the persons responsible for creating those
   buildinfo files comment on the scope of then, after which it should
   be decided whether
   1) *_source.changes should never list a buildinfo file, or
   2) *_source.changes may list a *_source.buildinfo file, or
   3) something else that does not work with the way the archive works.
The .buildinfo files were invented as part of the reproducible builds
project, but the decision to include a .buildinfo which talks about
binary packages, even in a source-only upload, was taken by the dpkg
maintainer.
My view from Thorsten's options is (1).
Ian.
