I brought one of my unstable installations up-to-date today. After a
reboot I noticed that the font was 11x22. That is, I did not have to
run setupcon manually.
I updated another unstable installation but this time upgraded only
systemd-sysv, libpam-systemd and console-setup. After a reboot I got
the usual tiny console font. Completing the upgrade and rebooting
gets me a 11x22 font.
I have no idea what has caused the change in behaviour but this bug
appears to have been fixed in some way.
Regards,
Brian.
