Much longer than that!  See "beauty" "deception" "kalon" vs "kallos"
in Plato's writing.  While some people use beauty to lie and cheat and
bend both truth and understanding, this is not always the case.
Something that is beautiful can be admirable and true.
If Debian's structure is all of these things, then shouldn't also be
its artwork and design?  Even website design...  Isn't this the point
of the Fibonacci logo?
