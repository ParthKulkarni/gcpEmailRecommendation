Hi,
Our target for 9.3 and 8.10 is the first weekend in December (this happily
makes the following target the beginning of February, avoiding the festive
season).
Accordingly I'm looking at one of:
25th November
2nd December
9th December (but preferably earlier, or we start gradually extending
              the cycle)
Please advise your availability.
Thanks,
--
