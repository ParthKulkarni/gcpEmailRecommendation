sbuild --run-autopkgtests is a sbuild feature, not a debci or autopkgtest
feature. It does not necessarily match the autopkgtest backend or
configuration used in any other instance of autopkgtest.

Yes. The production instance of debci on ci.debian.net uses lxc containers
and does not install build-essential in them unless asked to do so by
debian/tests/control.
(In principle it could also use qemu VMs or schroot containers, but
there's no reason to prefer schroot over lxc when lxc has already been
set up, and there haven't been enough resources so far to run qemu
for tests that declare the isolation-machine restriction: these are
currently skipped. For example, see the test results for nss-mdns or
systemd.)

This is a good test to have, but it should depend on either build-essential
or the individual packages that it needs (gcc or g++, libc-dev, make).
