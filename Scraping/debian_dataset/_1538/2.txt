If you do reintroduce it, please note the extra steps (reopening bugs
in particular)
On that note one thing that doesn't seem to be easy/well documented is how to go about finding the bugs that affected a package at the time of it's removal. If I go to the bugs page for the package and select "archived and unarchived" I see a bunch of resolved bugs but other than opening them up individually I don't see a good way to tell the difference between ones that were actually fixed and ones that were open at the time of the removal.
