This is likely a missing feature, since PackageKit does support
Debconf prompts and GNOME PackageKit does as well. Debconf stuff is
kind of hacked into it though (but given the architecture of Debconf
and PackageKit, there is no better way to do this).
So, I guess someone would need to implement proper Debconf support in
GNOME Software.
