I don't think violating Recommends is a practical alternative for our
non-systemd users.  The packaging system makes that too hard.

Recommends: dbus-user-session | sysvinit-core ?
We can probably find another way of spelling this.  But I remain to be
convinced that the three uses I found are correct even on those terms.

I don't understand how anyone could expect this to work, when there
are multiple login sessions.  Popping up a pin entry prompt on a
different display to the one the user is currently typing at is not
useful.  Obviously there are fundamental architectural problems with
the gnupg2 agent and there is little point rehearsing them again, but
starting the agent on demand does work better because pinentry
requests go to the right place.
But since pinentry-gnome3 comes from src:gnupg2, this is all part of
the same source package: the bug is in gnupg2 and should be fixed
there.

If you have multiple concurrent login sessions they each need their
own pulseaudio setup, because sounds from one session should not
appear in another.

This still doesn't explain to me why Rygel is per-user rather than
per-login-session.
