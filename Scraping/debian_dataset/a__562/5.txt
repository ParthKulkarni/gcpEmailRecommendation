Conflicts would greatly simplify packaging, but I'm afraid we need
coinstallability at least for upgrades.  With d-i installing systemd, the
user needs to be able to switch to sysvinit -- and, horrors, some might
want to go the other way.
It'd be damage to allow two loginds running at the same time, thus what
about:
* the "systemd" package starts its logind only if systemd is pid 1
* elogind starts its logind only if pid 1 is not systemd
That would handle runtime dependencies, I wonder how to handle them
apt-wise.  Alas, the only robust idea I have so far doesn't work with
multiarch, thus is worthless.
Meow!
