And for that reason dbus-user-session has Depends: systemd, which describes
this requirement just fine.  It runs systemd's user parts.  The rest of the
world has dbus-x11 which has some important features dbus-user-session
lacks, such as the ability to login multiple times.
A package whose very description says in its title:
"simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)"
depends on systemd, that's not surprising.  So as long as no dependency
chain forces it in, all is ok.

Is there a package that wants something beyond logind, yet doesn't depend on
systemd itself?  I can't seem to find any obvious candidate.
