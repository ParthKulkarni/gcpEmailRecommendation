BTW, the othere day, Dan Watkins and I discovered twiddle-wakka
version comparison operator in ruby, also known as pessimistic version
comparison.
For example ~> 4.0.1 in ruby means >> 4.0.1 && << 5.0.0, as in, it
limits comparison within a single series. Perhaps, we also need
something like that, to limit comparisons within a given epoch only.
I guess we could adopt twiddle-wakka like syntax [1], to negate things
as you suggest.

[1] making twiddle-wakka work in dpkg, differently from ruby, should
be an explicit design goal. </troll>
