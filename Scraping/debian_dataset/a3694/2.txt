Package: debian-installer
Severity: grave
Justification: renders package unusable
When trying to install Debian, the installer is unable to start, and the
following error appears:
"There was an error reading data from the CD-ROM. Please make sure it is in the
drive. If retrying does not work, you should check the integrity of your CD-
ROM."
Retrying does not solve the problem. On the console, with an AMD64 image, the
following output is displayed:
    cdrom-retriever: error: Unable to find
`/w/work/free/gnomepool/main/libl/libzlo2-2-udeb/libzlo2-2-udeb_2.08-1.2+b2_amd64.udeb`
This has been tested with the live image "debian-9.0.0-amd64-i386-netinst.iso"
on multiple machines by multiple people, including on my iMac via Virtualbox,
downloaded from torrent.
