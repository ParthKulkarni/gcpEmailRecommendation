This will update thethree files /etc/console-setup/cached_setup* if the 
times of /etc/default/{keyboard,console-setup} are more recent.  On the 
other hand, times of the files in /etc/default/* are not supposed to 
change.

Actualy these files should change only if console-setup is upgraded or 
the admin runs dpkg-reconfigure.

Thanks. :) Well, can you report the state of the affairs before you run
 	systemctl restart console-setup.service
ls --full-time /etc/default/{console-setup,keyboard} /etc/console-setup/cached_*
