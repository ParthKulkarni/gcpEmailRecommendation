Actually, this is an indication that console-setup has already 
configured these consoles.  As far as I know, there are only two 
components in a Debian system that open VTs -- getty and console-setup 
(and X for vt7).  If you see a created console without getty, then this 
console exists only because console-setup has done something to it.
If you would repeat this experiment on a system which didn't have 
console-setup installed, then ALT-RIGHT simply wouldn't work, it 
wouldn't switch to a console which didn't exist yet.  And it would be 
impossible to see an empty console without getty running on it.
Ofcourse, this doesn't explain why the configuration doesn't work -- 
because something overwrites it or because the configuration is 
performed too early, while the system is not prepared for it yet.
