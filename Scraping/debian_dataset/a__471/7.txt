This very much hints at a dependency problems, does it not ? 
Does your system exhibiting this behaviour run systemd ?

I'll constrain my "fixup" script to "-f" now to see whether
that will consistently fix what I am seeing (IOW whether we
can constrain the problem to font setting, which is likely).
I have sometimes noted the following which seems to suggest
that some dependency may come up late:
Directly after boot, during which no VT switch occurred, I
will see the login manager for KDE. When I now switch to the
first console and then ALT-RIGHT through my other consoles up
until vt6 they don't have a getty running just yet (they show
up as empty black screens). The second round through all of
them exhibit the getty login prompt. This happens only very
rarely but it _does_ come up every so often. This fact does
seem to hint a gettys being spawned in a delayed fashion.
I have observed something else, but only ONCE so far:
After running setupcon to fix the font problem one console
(sitting at the login prompt) did not get the message - it
stayed in the old, wrong font. Re-running setupcon fixed that
console, too. Other consoles - which reset to the correct
font upon the first setupcon invocation - where either logged
in or sitting at the login prompt as well, so it's not
whether they were logged in or not.
Might there be a race between getty spawning and setupcon
running ?
