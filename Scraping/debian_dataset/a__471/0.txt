As mentioned by Michael, this is not done by udev or systemd.

When it is created, the udev rule should be fired. So
cached_setup_font.sh should be invoked again.

I don't know of any component that does that. Systemd-vconsole, as
mentioned by Michael, is not enabled in the debian packages.
However, I see the following in cached_setup_font:
setfont '/etc/console-setup/cached_Lat15-Fixed16.psf.gz'
if ls /dev/fb* >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
    for i in /dev/vcs[0-9]*; do
        { :
            setfont '/etc/console-setup/cached_Lat15-Fixed16.psf.gz'
        } < /dev/tty${i#/dev/vcs} > /dev/tty${i#/dev/vcs}
    done
fi
Might it be that /dev/fb* do not exist during boot, and thus the font
is not loaded in all ttys?
