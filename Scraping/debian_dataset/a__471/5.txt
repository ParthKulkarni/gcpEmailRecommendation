Since systemd makes some configuration of the console, maybe the 
following scenario might explain what we observe:
1. systemd/udev creates a new console.
2. systemd begins the initialization of this console.
3. udev runs /etc/console-setup/cached_setup_font.sh by the following 
rule:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="vtconsole", KERNEL=="vtcon*", RUN+="/etc/console-setup/cached_setup_font.sh"
4. Now cached_setup_font.sh and systemd execute in parallel.  If 
cached_setup_font.sh wins, it will configure the console font first and 
then systemd will load another font.
My tests of how systemd works show that it does the following:
1. It reads the curent font of the current console.
2. Then it does some things to the console(s) (configuration).
3. When a new console is created it loads on it the font read in 1.
Therefore, it seems to me that if cached_setup_font.sh completes its job 
before 1. then everything should be ok.  And if systemd completes its 
configuration before cached_setup_font.sh starts its work, then again 
everything will be ok.  However if both work simultaneously things can 
go wrong.
So, if this scenario is possible, a natural question is what can be done 
in order to make sure the scripts of console-setup do not execute in 
parallel with systemd while configuring the console.
