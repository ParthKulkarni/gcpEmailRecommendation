I think systemd runs getty which opens a console.  Then the kernel 
creates virtual consoles on demand.

The kernel?

If /dev/fb* doesn't exist then the graphics card is in hardware text 
mode in which case there is one font on all ttys (due to hardware 
limitation).  If /dev/fb* is created afterwards, then udev will run 
cached_setup_font again.
I don't know what is going to happen if:
1. udev runs cached_setup_font while there is no framebuffer
2. the script tests that there is no /dev/fb*
3. before the script completes its work /dev/fb* is created
In this case the rule of udev will trigger for a second time.  However 
since the script hasn't finished yet will then udev run a second copy of 
it?  If not, then this too, might create problems.  On the other hand, 
if udev always runs cached_setup_font again, do both copies run in 
parallel (this shoudn't be a problem for cached_setup_font but it is 
good to know if such possibility exists)?
