It's not like Debian provides a way that nicely integrates with the
system except by what they are doing. Yes, one could ship a pin to limit
to specific packages, but from the point of the vendor there's no threat
here: They know what they are going to ship. And from a vendor point of
view you actually want to have the agility to rotate the GPG key in use,
to switch to a different hosting place, and to ship more packages as
required. So it's just that your and the vendor's assumptions mismatch.
Ultimately what most users want is something that is kept up-to-date. At
the point where they decided that they want (or need) to use a vendor's
software, it's not really our business anymore to tell them off. You
yield full control to the vendor at that point, just like Debian has
full control of your system.
If we had a sensible way to report back binary provenance, we could at
least call out when a vendor did something nefarious. (Like serving a
trojan to a specific user.) But we don't.
And to the point of nefavious vs. incompetence: The truth is that most
companies employ software engineers to do the packaging. Apart from
Linux being a small market for most of this software, it is also
something they are not necessarily familiar with or would need to hire
some kind of specialist for. I understand that you are in that business.
But at the same time most programmers assume that it's just a small
matter of programming and it can't be that hard to integrate with
another system. They can't really anticipate the bugs. But we at least
need to hold them accountable to listening to feedback.

That's also where you lost me, FWIW.
