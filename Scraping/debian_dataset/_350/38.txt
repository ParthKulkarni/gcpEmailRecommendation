This would be a nice safety feature for users and for us maintainers: I
know I won't screw up anybody's system with a font package as I
restricted it to /usr/share and /etc/fonts.
But I don't think it would solve the problem you pose. Who is going to
set the profile? If if is the 3rd party packager, they will just use
'core' and install their APT source (or whatever they want). If it can
be specified or overridden by the user at install time, then trying to
install Skype with --profile=default will make the installation fail,
and the user will just resort to --profile=core.
