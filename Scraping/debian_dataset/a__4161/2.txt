I wrote it as the original sendxmpp had TLS-problems for me and someone
else had problems sending to a groupchat with sendxmpp. So I thought an
alternative could easily be done.
But thinking it over I agree with you that 'just another sendxmpp'
isn't a unique feature set that justifies inclusion in Debian. Maybe I
was too excited and sent the RFP too quickly.

Seems I also was too quick here. I thought it was one command per
codebox on your post but some contain more and it turned out that this
command already fails: "gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder".
I would have to search the debian go documentation for details (maybe
this command is outdated) but as I am tending to agree with W. Martin
Borgert to close this RFP I might do this later with one of my other
projects which doesn't have an similar package already included in
Debian.
Best wishes,
Martin
