i'm not sure what you mean, but in case it helps, here some arguments
why sbws package is not called something like tor-sbws:
- upstream is not using "tor-*" in the name
- i don't think there's a Debian policy to name packages as "tor-*" [0]
- AFAICT, the only package in Debian that is named as "tor-*" is
"tor-geoipbd", and that's a package on which "tor" itself depends on.
- "tor" itself does not depends on sbws, though sbws makes use of "tor"
- python3-stem is a library to control tor on which sbws depends, and
it's not called "tor-*"
- nyx, is a tor monitor, and is not called "tor-*"
- there're several packages called "onion*", which is not "tor-*"
Best,
ju.
