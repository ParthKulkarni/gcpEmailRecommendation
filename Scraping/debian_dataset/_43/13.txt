I am very disappointed to read that your work is still being blocked.
But I really don't like this as a response, either.  Surely we are,
collectively, better than this.
I realise it may sometimes seem like ftpmaster are a secretive and
unaccountable cabal and seem that the only thing to do is work around
them.  But in Debian we should try to fix problems rather than working
around them.
So, please instead refer this matter to the Technical Committee.
As far as I am concerned, consensus in this thread is that whether the
unstrippedness is a bug or not, even an RC bug, it is not at all
any kind of a justification for a REJECT.
Thanks,
Ian.
