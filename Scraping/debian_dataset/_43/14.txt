Right. The FTP-master check is primarily for things we shouldn't ship
because it's not legal (primarily copyright infringement, but
potentially other things like patents, munitions, under-age porn). To
stop things getting into the archive that will cause a load of
trouble. Some other basic checks for 'is completely broken' are also
fair enough. But everything beyond that I think we should handle in
the normal way, as bugs, to discuss.
Maintainers get lots of QA checks from our infra, and we like it when
they take notice, but disagreeing, or simply not doing much about it
in a timely manner, is not a reason to keep software out of the
archive IMHO. I sense feature-creep in the (already tricky) job of
FTP-master, and I'm not convinced it's a good idea.

This seems sensible to me.
