Currently, as far as I can tell, sudo is build without PC_INSULTS. We
should probably rename the sudo package to sudo-offensive.
This option is defined in the source code as "Define to 1 to replace
politically incorrect insults with less offensive ones." and so by not
defining this option, the package is explicitly built to be offensive.
Obviously we should allow for a transitional package here...
(I'm sure there are many other examples in Debian, just highlighting
that it's not just those 3 packages.)
Thanks,
Iain.
