Ok, thanks!
What was in common in failed builds was that it started creating xml
files from gpl.xml (depending in which order the filesystem laid
files).  I could then reproduce the issue easily by starting with it.
What happens is that for 'da' there is no translation, and in that
case msgattrib does *not* create the file, and thus po2xml just fails
without an explicit error message.  I fixed it by passing --force-po to
msgattrib to always create a file, even if without any translation.

Well, we usually upload installation-guide when we need it for a d-i
release, so I'm not sure we can really wait for a buildd with unknown
processing power and busyness to build it.
