Thanks for CCing me; I'm not following this thread anymore (as it
surpassed the threshold above which I stop to dedicate my time to it),
so please CC me if you need my input on anything.

Exactly.
just calling plain `pdebuild` without any option will (roughly) call
  1. dpkg-buildpackage -S -d -us -uc -rfakeroot $other_user_options
  2. sudo pbuilder build $some_options $user_options ../$pkg_$ver.dsc

I don't understand what you're planning to do to sbuild.

And I haven't understood what "this plan" is, either.
FYI, James asked me whether I was fine to move from that
`dpkg-buildpackage` invocation to call `dpkg-source` instead (with the
--before-build and --after-build things too), and my only concerns is
people who are relying on finding a _source.changes in '..'.
My current workflow is basically calling `pdebuild` in a source tree
and if the build works `debsign ../$pkg_$ver_source.changes` and then
dput it (not that my BUILDRESULT is a directory elsewhere that I clean
often).  I don't think what I'm doing is exotic enough to be fine
disrupting it.
