Apologies if I offended you. I wasn't trying to argue the merits of
the FTP team's decision (which I respect and agree with!), or of your
opinion about distributing ZFSonLinux binaries. I was just trying to
explain the background to my question.
I would be very grateful if you (or anybody else with the relevant
knowledge) would answer the question I posted:
Does Debian distribute a Debian Installer that will (either by
default, or at the user's request) install source or binary packages
from no repositories other than "main" and "contrib"? If so, is there
any reason in principle why that installer could not in future be
distributed with the capability to (download and) compile and run ZFS,
and to provide the user with the option to install Debian onto a ZFS
root partition?
