Good point. Potential avenues:
1. Move ZFS *source* into "main". Would this be possible without
compromising Debian's "obviously prudent" arrangement?[1] Should I CC
debian-legal?
2. Add ZFS to a Debian Installer that is not the *default* Debian
Installer. Does Debian distribute such an installer, to which the
facility to compile and run ZFS could be added?
Thanks :)
