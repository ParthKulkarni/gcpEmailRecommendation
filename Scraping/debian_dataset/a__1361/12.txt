If the Debian Installer were instead to ship with, or to download at
runtime, the ZFS on Linux source code, would that be acceptable from a
licensing standpoint?
If so, then if the user were to instruct the Installer to use ZFS for
some or all partitions, the Installer would (download and) compile and
run the ZFS code appropriately.
Please correct me if I am mistaken about this being viable in principle.
Please CC me if you do so, as I am not subscribed to the mailing list.
