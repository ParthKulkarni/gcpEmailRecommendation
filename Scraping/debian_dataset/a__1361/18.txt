Forgive my ignorance, but why will it not happen?

Thanks for the information. Can the non-free aspect of that installer
be disabled by the user during installation? If not, then it would be
no use to anyone I know who would be interested in running ZFS under
Debian. That is because a key reason to use Debian in preference to
other distros is that Debian's blob-free kernel and DFSG-compliant
main and contrib repositories make it easy to avoid installing
non-free software. If a person doesn't mind the risk of installing
non-free firmware then they may as well just skip Debian and use
Ubuntu or FreeBSD instead, which ship with ZFS in the installer by
default.
If it can't be disabled, then let me rephrase my earlier question.
Does Debian distribute a Debian Installer that will install only
DFSG-compliant software, to which the facility to compile and run ZFS
could in principle be added? (After all, everything in "contrib" is
DFSG-compliant,[1] including the ZFS-related packages.) If so, please
could you provide me with a link to it?
Thanks again :)
