While there might be a way to do this work technically, it's probably
fair to say that none of the existing maintainers have any plans to
work on it. It would need massive effort, and there's no sign of those
maintainers showing any interest in doing it. That sounds like a
reasonable description of "wontfix" to me.
If somebody was actually working on patches, that might change the
situation.
