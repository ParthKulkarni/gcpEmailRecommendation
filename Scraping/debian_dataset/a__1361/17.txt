I was not aware of that. Thank you for making this crucial point :)

Given that a machine intended to run ZFS is likely to be provisioned
with >2GB of RAM (much more than the Debian Installer would normally
require), might a viable workaround be for the Debian Installer to
take the following steps?
- Ensure that some minimum amount of RAM is available, and refuse to
proceed with a root-on-ZFS installation if not;
- install the toolchain, ZFS source, and any other packages from
"main" or "contrib" necessary to support these, to a RAM disk;
- compile and load ZFS functionality;
- format the target HDD/SSD using ZFS;
- copy the toolchain binaries and ZFS source packages, etc, to the
relevant places on the target HDD/SSD (/usr/bin ,
/var/cache/apt/archives/ , etc);
- resume the installation as usual.

True. So to proceed towards solving this feature request, I guess the
initial focus should be on how to install the root ZFS
partition/dataset. Figuring out how to handle other
partitions/datasets can wait until that has been solved.
