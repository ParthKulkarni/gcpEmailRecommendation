Thanks. I have searched for such a discussion but have not yet found
it. Do you have a link to the discussion? Did its conclusions
definitely cover source distribution, or only binaries?

Your remark is surprising to me. It seems to contradict the
information I have encountered. For example, see:
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=zfs&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
Some of the packages listed there are in main, and are therefore DFSG
compliant.[0] The remainder are marked "[contrib]", and so must also
be DFSG-compliant,[0] albeit not necessarily GPLv2-compatible. None of
them are marked "[non-free]".
Additionally:
- The FSF regards the CDDL as a free software license.[1]
- Debian regards the MPL (to which the CDDL is very similar[2]) as a
DFSG-compliant license.[3]
So, I am not sure why you say that ZFSonLinux binaries are non-free.
Please could you explain?
Thank you again for answering my questions and for helping to provide
clarity about the prospect of Debian distributing an Installer with
some kind of ZFS on root option.
