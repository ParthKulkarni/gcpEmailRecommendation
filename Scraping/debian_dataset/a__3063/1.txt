Package: d-i.debian.org
Severity: important
Hi,
Since dillon's upgrade to stretch, the following cron job no longer works:
| Subject: Cron <d-i@dillon> nice -n 19 $HOME/bin/generate_l10n-stats
| â€¦
| -------------- Level 1 --------------
| Getting sources:I do not have permission to write to /var/lib/debtags/
That's been around for a while.

| W: The repository 'http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian testing InRelease' is not signed.
That seems to have been happening starting a few days after the
initial stretch release (mid-June).

Those issues seem new.
It would be nice if someone could look into what's needed to get that
to work again. Reminder: this is run through the d-i user on
dillon.debian.org, so root permissions are out of the question.
Thanks for your time.
KiBi.
