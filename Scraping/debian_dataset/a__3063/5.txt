This is finally fixed.
It took me a lot of time to figure out that I actually had to manually
populate ~d-i/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ with the content of
/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ on dillon.debian.org
So, now we get:
-------------- Level 1 --------------
Getting sources:I do not have permission to write to /var/lib/debtags/
This one is there for a whil. So far, I found no way to tell apt that
it should use an alternate directory for debtags....or not use debtags
at all as we don't care about these.
W: Problem unlinking the file archives - Clean (21: Is a directory)
W: Problem unlinking the file cache - Clean (21: Is a directory)
These are still there and weren't in the past, but I don't think
they're harmful, just annoying.

Number of strings:

Could not fetch spellcheck stats file for level
/home/d-i/l10n/material/packages.cvs1/debian-installer/packages/po/sublevel3/mg.po.
This is also not alloying. Funnily the file changes from day to day,
that's weird.
