So all the parts of the puzzle are present, still it isn't complete yet.
Over here no macbook. So hands-on expirence with the mentioned hardware.
Thing the original poster could do:
* Share the download URL
* See if there is checksum for the ISO on the website
* Verify the download with the checksum
* cat /path/to/debian-mac-testing-amd64-netinst.iso > /dev/sdx
 that is an alternative for `dd plus parameters`,  '/dev/sdx' is the thumb drive
* try again
* State the exact model of the macbook. Year of production might also help.
With the reported feedback would be possible for macbook owners to reproduce it.
Knowing if it boots is enough, no need to do an install.
