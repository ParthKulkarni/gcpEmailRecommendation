There's already text mentioning the special mac images, for example at
  http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/9.2.1/amd64/iso-cd/
But that's not currently added for the daily builds. Fixing that right
now. Maybe I could also make expand it and make it more prominent
yet. The text we have currently says:
"The mac netinst CD here is a special version of the netinst CD image
 that is targeted specifically at older 64-bit Intel Macintosh
 machines. It will likely work on most other amd64 machines too, but it
 does not contain UEFI boot files that some people need."
