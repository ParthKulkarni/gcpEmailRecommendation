I was only trying to show my record of trying to fix the issue the right
way and not just finding loop holes as some people imply. It is only
fair for me to ask people to take things in perspective.
I also wanted to emphasis some people just want see a solution as just
keep out these packages and I want to contrast my efforts.
We are a do-o-cratic collective and people who are doing the work really
have an edge in our collective.
