The whole purpose of having contrib and non-free is to host packages
that can't be in main, either permanently or temporarily. I fail to see
how it is against the spirit.

This is in dependency chain of gitlab

Packaging of rollup is stuck [1] and I can make progress with gitlab
package with node-d3-color in contrib. Quite a lot of work can happen
even with gitlab in contrib, like making sure everything is configured
correctly, making sure update from previous version is working, people
can test and report bugs while we are working on getting all
dependencies in main etc. If I simply wait for rollup to arrive in main,
I can't do any of those.
It is much easier to move a package from contrib to main than start
packaging from scratch after rollup is in main. I have been able to move
many packages to main, which needed babel, using this same strategy.
[1] It needs someone to port acorn-object-spread to acorn 5
