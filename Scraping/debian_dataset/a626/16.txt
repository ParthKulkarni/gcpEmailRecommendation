This is not a fair response.
If your work involved fixing bugs in software that is already in the
archive, you could quite fairly call others out for demanding changes,
but not being willing to put in the effort.
In this case, others are objecting to you /adding/ something new to the
archive, where this requires (what is in the view of some) a misuse of
contrib.
You're right to point out that the decision as to whether it was a
misuse was the ftp-master's.
