Lets take the two issues separately.
1. Whether they are suitable for contrib
2. Whether network can be used during build.

Like I noted in my previous mail, I already agreed to upload pre-built
binaries and my contention is only on point 1. You may ask ftp-masters
on suitability of them being in contrib even with pre-built binaries.
I have also explained in my previous mails that these are always built
on a maintainer's machine as buildds already prohibit network access
during build. So we are only talking about a change in perception.
