It seems the FTBFS is not on the official buildds, but other archive
wide build services have a stricter policy on network access and will
result in a serious bug.

It is always npmjs.com, which is depended on by entire nodejs community.
While it is not impossible for this to go down, the chances are less.
And even if it fails at some point, a rebuild later would produce the
exact same binary.
And for getting predictable builds, we can lock down the dependencies to
exact versions with cryptographic checksums. yarn [1] and [2] npm, both
support this.
Though it will require updating npm to a newer version [3] and/or
packaging yarn [4] (both are in progress).
If I were to use one of these lock files so build process becomes
reproduce-able, would it be agreeable for you? (not an immediate option.
but may be possible in future).
In the short term, I will switch to including pre-built files and will
revisit this situation when/if either npm or yarn with locking feature
is available in the archive.
