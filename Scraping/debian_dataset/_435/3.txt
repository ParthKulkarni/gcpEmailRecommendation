There are various other edge cases as well: repacked upstream releases,
packaging of an upstream VCS snapshot, upstream version "numbers" that
start with letters and therefore aren't valid Debian version strings, and
so forth.
The original reporter is correct that we don't preserve the actual
upstream version number somewhere in our packaging in every case.  You can
get it from the package version in probably 95% of the cases, but the
remaining 5% require a lot of esoteric knowledge of Debian conventions and
possibly that specific package.
That said, I'm still not sure what the original problem statement is.
When would it be useful to programmatically extract the original upstream
version number?  The other Debian use case that I'm aware of for this is
uscan, which does quite a bit of other work and wouldn't particularly
benefit from an Upstream-Version field.
There is a gap here, but why is it worth the packaging overhead to fix?
