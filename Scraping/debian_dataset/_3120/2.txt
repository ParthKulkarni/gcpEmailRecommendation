Well, is it possible that the first run was done by setting ‚ÄúEnter
device manually‚Äù and typing Enter, then the second one by selecting the
second disk? This would definitely explain the syslog you attached,
which I've just reproduced locally.
I might set up automated tests for RAID1 at a latter point but I'm
inclined to suspect this is only user issue here.
