  Description     : font that fixes the shortcomings of Comic Sans
 Comic Sans wasn’t designed to be the world’s most ubiquitous casual
 typeface. Comic Neue aspires to be the casual script choice for
 everyone including the typographically savvy.
 .
 The squashed, wonky, and weird glyphs of Comic Sans have been beaten
 into shape while maintaining the honesty that made Comic Sans so
 popular.
 .
 It's perfect as a display face, for marking up comments, and writing
 passive aggressive office memos.
