Dear Steve,
I stand corrected. It is indeed the live image which is at fault.
While doing so, I have also made a wishlist bug #866971 which probably
needs some art inputs, although am not sure of the feasibility of the
idea.
Sorry for the noise and hope the bug gets fixed soon.
On another note, I do hope we can have some kind of intimation when we
are close to a release, so we can have pre-release parties with the
same pomp and show that we do for the post-release parties and have
more people contribute to finding showstopper bugs such as these.
Looking forward to the fix and your thoughts.
