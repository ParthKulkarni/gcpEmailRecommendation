Dear all,
We were doing a release party for Stretch in Pune when we were hit
with this bug. Notice the UI, it seems even regular (not just live) is
also hit with the same bug.  The picture was captured by Gaurav. As we
were in midst of things, I forgot to see what messages were coming on
the console. The one which we were using is amd64 iso-non-free (for
drivers)
Hope this is fixed ASAP.
