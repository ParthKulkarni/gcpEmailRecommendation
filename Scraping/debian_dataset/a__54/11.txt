More into this one, please, take a look at
https://release-engineering.github.io/productmd/treeinfo-1.0.html
There it's specified that we could have the checksums to ensure that
the file provided is the one downloaded.
But, again, if someone takes over one of the servers, they can just
change the checksums and provide a different file. Although this
scenario is not related to having or not having a .treeinfo file.
