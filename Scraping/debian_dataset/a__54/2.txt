Accessing hardcoded URLs (to .treeinfo or other files) isn't a good
idea in case they change.

It is however protected in the same way all of the archive is, using
OpenPGP signatures on the Release files and a hash chain to the files
themselves.
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/Release
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/SHA256SUMS

If a .treeinfo were added for each of the installer directories, I
assume it wouldn't be treated any different to the other files in
those directories.

Personally, until something better exists (such as .treeinfo) I would
be using the apt repository metadata. It seems to contain similar info
to the example treeinfo you quoted anyway.
