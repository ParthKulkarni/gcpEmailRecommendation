Dear Debian Installer people:
Even when we allow network access in the autobuilder, building this
package no longer works since version 20170615+deb9u1.

Building 20170615+deb9u1, but stretch-proposed-updates has , failing the build
debian/rules:19: recipe for target 'get-images-amd64' failed
make[1]: *** [get-images-amd64] Error 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Without using any special flag or environment variable, what I would
expect is that it downloads things from stretch as well, as every
point release of stretch should ideally be "self-contained" for
building purposes.
I see this line in debian/rules:
export DISTRIBUTION?=stretch-proposed-updates
Maybe that's the problem.
I'm putting all my build logs here for you to see:
https://people.debian.org/~sanvila/build-logs/debian-installer-netboot-images/
You will see that version 20170615 of this package used to build ok in
the past.
[ Note: I fear that this could be another wontfix bug, like the one
  complaining about network access, so I will not bother to set a
  severity, but I still believe that for consistency, packages in
  stretch should be buildable in stretch by default, even when they
  need network access ].
  If, after all, you consider that the cure is worse than the disease,
  then please consider this as a documentation bug and if possible
  explain somewhere why we are not expected to build this package
  without failures ].
Thanks.
