I've pushed a prospective branch (pu/fix-ftbfs-in-stretch) with two commits:
  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer-netboot-images/commit/86f910f8e1e60e308747a7f53045862705b0a132
  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer-netboot-images/commit/eb2e5b3fb437b288c4c83427fb1c0d213f7b5a5e
Only checked with the first few architectures (still on limited bandwidth),
but that seems to do the trick. Slightly not happy about having that check
and fallback done for each and every architecture (instead of once and for
all), which could again lead to bits and pieces from both sources mixed
together); but I guess that's a reasonable compromise (no big changes needed
in the code).
I'll let others comment on this bug report plus proposed solution; Didier
maybe?
(Of course testing needs to happen when there's a version in s-p-u again.)
Cheers,
