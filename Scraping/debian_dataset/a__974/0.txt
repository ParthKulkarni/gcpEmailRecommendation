Exactly. If a pure s-p-u build fails, it's because the s-p-u debian-installer 
isn't built on all architectures, so the d-i-n-i s-p-u build should really 
fail. (acronyms ftw)

That seems more fool-proof and consistent: download from a single suite: 
either from s-p-u or from stretch only, and for all archs.

Looks good to me, given that strategy.

I've tried for some time to (ab)use make targets to modify DISTRIBUTION 
depending on partial calls to get_images, but failed.
Given my failed attempts, I suspect your patches are the lesser evil	for 
solving this. But I'm not convinced that solving this is better than ensuring 
we only ever build "pure-stretch" or "pure-stretch-proposed-updates" d-i-n-
i's.

Thanks for the explicit ping; I'm not on top of Debian things these days.
