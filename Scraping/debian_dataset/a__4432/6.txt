Hi there,
I'd like to discuss addition of a new lintian checks for
getenv/setenv/putenv used in shared libraries.
Per glibc manual:
Modifications of environment variables are not allowed in
multi-threaded programs.
-- the glibc manual
[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Access.html#Environment-Access]
I am targetting in particular the libjpeg / turbojpeg family which I
know are used in multithreaded programs.
A good demo program:

Comments anyone ?
Thanks
