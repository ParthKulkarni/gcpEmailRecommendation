Ian, cc'ing you to make you aware of this discussion, in case you 
aren't, and give you an opportunity to comment on your aim to adopt 
sysvinit package from some time ago.
KatolaZ, Ian feel free to drop Cc's again, I won't be offended :)

In addition to that
https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/sysvinit
gives a good overview of the state of the package.
Including the request for adoption that has been already mentioned in 
the thread:
RFA: sysvinit -- System-V-like init utilities - transitional package
https://bugs.debian.org/811377
(I reported the spam in that bug already.)
Also the changelog gives an impression who worked last on the packages:
https://tracker.debian.org/media/packages/s/sysvinit/
changelog-2.88dsf-59.11
Michael Biebl maintains Systemd and related packages and uploaded the 
last version mainly to activate some changes that benefit Systemd. Ian 
Jackson was the last one aiming at adopting the package, but apparently 
did not work on it afterwards anymore:
Re: Bug#811377: fixed in sysvinit 2.88dsf-59.9
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=811377#104
To me it looks like that the package is ready for adoption, as Petter 
also already mentioned:
Re: Debian Buster release to partially drop non-systemd support
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/10/msg00171.html
For adopting it, one would need to become at least a Debian maintainer, 
orâ€¦ have someone who sponsors uploads. For an easy start I think the 
sponsoring can work out nicely, but for a permanent solution its good to 
be allowed to upload new versions.
I'd suggest to write to sysvinit-devel mailinglist for any further 
coordination as I bet the larger audience of debian-devel is not really 
needed or helpful for that:

Thanks,
