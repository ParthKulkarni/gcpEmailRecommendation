I've done this, since it seemed a natural extension of my previous email
about trying to find people who might have effort and maybe facilitate a
bit of co-ordination.
So:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/debian-init-diversity
It's a standard mailman list with a public archive. I'm hoping people
interested in init system diversity in Debian can use it as a place to
co-ordinate. I don't want it to be used to slag off $init_system or
$distribution_or_derivative.
Regards,
Matthew
