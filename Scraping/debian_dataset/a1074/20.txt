Hi!
I think the proposal sounds very good in general. I just might see a
problem with one of the requirements, which seems open to potential
conflict.

Some packages might not show activity for longish periods of time,
because maintainers batch changes, for example to do at least one
upload per release, with general packaging and QA updates/improvements,
etc.
Also there might be bugs open that are difficutl to fix (with no
patch), etc, that might show no activity for a long time.
So I'd probably qualify the requirement above. I'm not entirely sure
how though. I mean [c] kind of covers it superficially, but I'm not
sure that's clear enough or if the intention was something along these
lines. For example, if there's a difficult bug open, and then a patch
is sent and gets no reply, that could count as inactivity in my book,
but not otherwise.
Thanks,
Guillem
