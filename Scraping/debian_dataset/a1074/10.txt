Would it be a big hassle for you to reply to a hypothetical salvaging
bug saying essentially what you just wrote, or maybe some short form? As
far as I understand that would be enough to stop any salvaging process.
I agree that it's a bit of busywork for the maintainer, but maybe that
bug could be left open and marked wontfix to avoid too much opening and
closing of bugs.
