I sympathize with wanting simpler conditions (they did get simpler
during debcamp), and it might be that these can further simplified
without harming anything. On the other hand, at least for me, one of the
main motivations is to make this process accessible to new contributors
to Debian. In this context I think it is much better to explicit, both
to shield would be salvagers from negative reactions and to shield
package maintainers from "unreasonable" [1] salvaging attempts.
[1]: the scare quotes acknowledge that the current discussion is rooted
in the idea of package ownership, and doesn't seek to radically change
that notion.
