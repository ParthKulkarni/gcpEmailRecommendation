And if it is absolutely necessary to follow up on such a message
because it seems like it might be a forgery or something, then that
should be done privately and with great care.  It should be
accompanied by an apology; and the message should probably be reviewed
for tone and content by someone other than the author.
But I agree that this will almost never be necessary.
Ian.
