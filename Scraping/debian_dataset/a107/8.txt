There were *far* fewer of them when he did. In 2000, you didn't need an
advocate, and the NM process was very new, and very much ad hoc still.

He did not, the CoC didn't exist yet 14 years ago.

Given the context that he described -- the so-called "editorial changes"
GR, I can quite understand that. That GR was quite upsetting to a large
number of people -- myself included -- and plenty of people chose to
quit the project rather than be a part of a project that allows people
to be deceived in this manner. That was a breach of trust for some
people, and given that, why would you want to care about any of the
procedures anymore?
If you weren't around at the time, I strongly suggest you research that
a bit.
Even so, I do agree with the claim that his mail was overly aggressive,
and that that wasn't really necessary.
