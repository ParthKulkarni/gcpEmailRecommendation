If they are accepted for 2017.05, maybe Vagrant could add them to the
2017.03 Debian package.

Are you ok with the approach I proposed (i.e. requiring users to
install a new u-boot, which hopefully we'll have in Debian unstable at
some point) or would you prefer your original solution that works with
the built-in u-boot?  My worries are about supporting upgrades from
the original u-boot to mainline u-boot.  Going with the generic u-boot
approach would avoid this issue.
