> Did I see it right and this would be python 2?
Probably.  I just used /usr/bin/python and did not care much about
python 2 or 3 when writing it.  As far as I know, there is not much
stopping it from working with python 3, but I have not done the porting.
I agree that it should migrate to python 3 as soon as possible. :)
