I think we want to be have a smaller minbase for use cases where it
matters but I don't think that we necessarily want less packages in
the default installation. In particular not when they add value,
which isenkram clearly does.

I'm not sure what tool you are referring to. In any case, I appreciate
that isenkram installs the correct packages for virtualbox,
vmware, etc.
While our official VM/cloud images are usually not built with
debian-installer, I stronly believe that d-i should have a nice behaviour
in VM and install the appropriate packages for the virtualization
technology in use.
If isenkram is not the solution to this, then we need something else.

What do you mean by this?
Reusing the mapping database maintained in isenkram in the context of d-i?
I would like Petter to give a broader comparison of discover vs isenkram.
But I believe that isenkram is a bit smarter in that it doesn't only
handles devices ID discovered in PCI/USB/whatever buses but it also relies
on data from the system (dmidecode and stuff like that) to infer more
packages to install.
So it might not be trivially reusable in the context of discover for
example.

Petter, do you have more details about your former discussions?
