Every package which requires fdisk would still need to be adjusted to add a
Depends relationship exactly for the reason you cited: if fdisk becomes a
Recommends then it can be de-installed, thus breaking packages that require it.
Thus, making it a Recommends would not change the fact that now some packages
have to be adjusted.
