In short, this alone use-case answers Steve's original question which
was primarily are there any users who use or would use this tool or
his time would be better spent somewhere else. I think just the above
use-case and number of users answers the need for a tool like
live-wrapper. As has been pointed out by me and others, it just needs
more testing (documentation and love by devs.) to drive more usage
forwards.
