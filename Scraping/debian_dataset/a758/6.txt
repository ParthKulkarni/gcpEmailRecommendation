Hey,
I was wondering, are the debian maintainers planning on backporting the 
-mindirect-branch=thunk support introduced in GCC 7.3 and 8.1 to the 
compilers available on Jessie and Stretch? While this is not necessarily 
a security fix for the compiler it does provide that fix to at least 
kernels compiled using it.
