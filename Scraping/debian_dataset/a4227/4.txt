Mmmm.  I do agree actually with Russ about this more than I do with
Sean.  I agree that for many packages keeping a rebasing patch stack
is very desirable.  Where I disagree with Russ is how we should store
and exchange that patch stack.  I think we should do that by suitable
git trickery rather than by exporting and reimporting as patches.

We have been occasionally using
vcs-pkg-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org for development type
discussions.  There isn't really a user-focused list.  I'm happy to
have the conversation here if others don't mind.
