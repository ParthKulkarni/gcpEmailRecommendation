On closer examination of what?
The headers of the mail you're apparently complaining about look pretty
genuinely like the mail really did come from gmail, so are you
suggesting that 'The Illuminati <trainjohnson87@gmail.com>' is the spammer?
That looks like a genuine person -- I cannot imagine a spammer creating
supporting evidence for a spamming account.  e.g.: https://twitter.com/trainjohnson87
Note that that twitter account appears to belong to someone called
Anthony, which matches the salutation in the Spam that he then replied
to.
The level of maturity shown in his reply appears to be in line with
someone that is obsessed with minecraft.

It seems very plain to me that the spammers are recycling headers from
our list mail on the basis that gmail's anti-spam will have learned that
as HAM, and are so are more likely to let that pass through.
That then provokes a small fraction of the victims to shout at us,
because they don't know ho to read headers.
That is what you are seeing.
If anyone knows people that fight spam at gmail, I suppose that they
might want to treat listmail that comes from an unusual IP address with
great suspicion, but I don't think this is in any way limited to gmail.
I guess we could help the mail servers of the recipients of the initial
messages make that decision if we did SPF for debian.org, but I guess
that the lack of SPF probably indicates that this is very hard to do
with our distributed setup.
Cheers, Phil.
