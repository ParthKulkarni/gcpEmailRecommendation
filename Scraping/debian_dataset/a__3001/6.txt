Your impression is correct.  However, there's nothing that Debian can do or 
omit --except denying subscription to those whose mailbox belongs to a 
DMARC-strict domain-- that can relieve it from DMARC processing by recipients' 
MX servers.  That is to say, (1) Debian can enable some anti-DMARC actions in 
Mailman configurations to avoid delivery problems, and (2) it can publish SPF, 
DKIM, and DMARC records.   Feedback resulting from (2) might inform a strategy 
for (1), but no reasonable choice of (2), including doing nothing, is going to 
alter /the effects/ of decisions made in (1).
In any case, message 13[*] would have passed as authentic, as it was.
