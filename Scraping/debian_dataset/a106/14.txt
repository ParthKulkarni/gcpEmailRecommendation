Like Karsten, my experience with deb.debian.org has been inconsistent.
With a 50 Mb/s ADSL line in Montr√©al, most of the top candidates
mirrors from netselect will consistently deliver ~6200 kB/s, but
deb.debian.org often connects to an AWS instance where the download
proceeds no more than 350 KB/s...
Additionally, I think that it is reasonable that users look at the
mirror list for the following reason: Our mirrors are a list of
organisations and universities who donate storage and bandwidth.
Having users look at this list provides the opportunity for the user
to recognise their donation--something like "oh, these are the
entities who support FLOSS in my country".
Thus, I believe that hiding this from the user reduces the reciprocity
with these donors, and reduces the incentive to donate
storage/bandwidth.
That said, I think there should be some sort of mechanism to reward
those mirrors who provide TLS.  It's becoming normal for a browser to
display "insecure site" for those which don't support SSL...
Cheers,
Nicholas
