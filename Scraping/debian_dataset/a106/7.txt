I disagree with that, but I do also agree that it would be preferable if
local proxies or mirrors were used preferably.
However, this shouldn't be done by way of manual configuration; instead,
I think it should be done by way of autodetection performed by apt,
something not unlike the proxy-PAC scheme, where a browser looks for
pac.<domain>, with the <domain> part being what was passed to it by
DHCP, incrementally dropping off the leaf-most part of that until it
resolves.
I think such a scheme could work for apt too.
