The existing mirror network has several longstanding problems:
1. Many mirrors don't reliably update
2. Some mirrors aren't reliably available at all
3. Many mirrors don't carry all release architectures (even a few
   of the "primary" ones don't)
4. Most mirrors don't support TLS
httpredir.debian.org attempted to solve the first 3 problems while
still doing what you want: it redirected to local mirrors known to have
up-to-date files.  This would have been almost ideal as a default.  But
apparently it required a lot of maintenance work, which no-one was
prepared to continue doing.
That's why deb.debian.org is a plain CDN which doesn't rely on the
existing mirror network.  It also supports TLS (which I think should
also be enabled by default in the installer).
If deb.debian.org still doesn't provide reasonably fast service in some
countries, then maybe we should still askâ€”but then we should put
deb.debian.org at the top of the mirror list for most countries.

I say we take off; nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.
