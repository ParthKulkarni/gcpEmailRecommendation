Such abstract entities / synchronization points are usually defined
using targets.
See man systemd.target and systemd.special

I agree. Such synchronization points are best avoided if possible.
As a side note: In the past, the systemd package shipped a
mail-transport-agent.target but this was dropped in 229-6
https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd/commit/e50c3295026fda0aa67d0c5d8f7a22c6f2e56efa
I would prefer if mail-transport-agent.target was not re-introduced.
