IMHO it was not in testing for quite some time, as it was gone from main to contrib.
But YMMV :)

Doesn't libvirt create a virbr0 bridge upon installation?
At least all my setups have that, and it is perfect for my needs:
* host can talk to the guests
* guests can talk to the host
* guests can get to "the internet" due to NAT setup by libvirt
The setup should look someting like this:
# virsh net-dumpxml default
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>ffa97f93-f2bf-449e-9a3b-84a628367afb</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:66:1e:09'/>
  <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>

IMHO the above implements option 1?

I also use LXC on the same bridge, just for the fact that it is already set
up and provides DHCP, DNS and NAT.
