So those who don't want it can fix their bloody configuration.
Are you honestly suggesting that we should create unnecessary fluff for
all our users just because NAT doesn't work for a small minority of our
users?
It's always possible to create a bridge manually, there's no need to do
that from the installer; and NAT works out of the box (virt-manager will
even suggest you enable the default network if you try to use it and it
hasn't been enabled yet).
