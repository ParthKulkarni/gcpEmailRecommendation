Package: task-xfce-desktop
Version: 3.39
Severity: wishlist
Hi!
Currently, the XFCE task pulls in evince, whose interface is really out of
place outside of Gnome.  It'd be far better to install atril instead (from
Mate) -- it blends in with XFCE seamlessly.  It also doesn't suffer from a
number of weird decisions taken by the Gnome project that make the user
interface really inconsistent with XFCE components.
Atril is a fork of Evince, so base functionality is the same.
