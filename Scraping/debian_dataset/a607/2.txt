Based on Julien's feedback (which matches my initial impressions from
last time I looked into this), I've moved to preparing a new netcfg
upload with the attached change. Leaving a debug message behind will
make it possible to figure out what happens when users complain about
the lack of this rdnssd package, so that we might adjust if needed.
IIRC this issue is also affecting jessie so I'll make a note for
possibly pushing this for a later point release.

Subject: [PATCH] Stop queueing rdnssd's installation with IPv6 setups (Closes:
 #854801).
This component conflicts with network-manager and installing it from the
network configuration step might prevents large parts of desktop
environments from being installed. This isn't a perfect solution but
this should be way better than the current status quo.
