The question was raised
as https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2018/02/msg00339.html
and https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2018/02/msg00194.html
and became https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=891067
This bugreport against Debian kernel handbook is for asking 
to document what to do when new kernel supports new hardware.
That `make deb` builds a .deb which can be installed
with `dpkg -i ../linux-image-*.deb`
What the policy is about backporting and releasing new kernels in stable.
(See also https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=890393 )
The idea, the wish, is that upon future simular questions
posted at d-kernel@l.d.o  and/or  d-boot@l.d.o. can be answered with:
  Please visit  URL=at=kernel=handbook for information what you can do
