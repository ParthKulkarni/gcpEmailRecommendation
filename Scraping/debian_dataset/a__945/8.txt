1. there has been no recent code change in this regard, so the implementation
has been the same for a long time.
2. Reading the whole paragraph gives the answer to your question:
<cited>
Setting up your clock and time zone is followed by the creation of user accounts. By
default you are asked to provide a password for the <quote>root</quote>
(administrator) account and information necessary to create one regular user
account. If you do not specify a password for the <quote>root</quote> user, this
account will be disabled but the <command>sudo</command> package will be installed
later to enable administrative tasks to be carried out on the new system.
By default, the first user created on the system will be allowed to use the
<command>sudo</command> command to become root.
</cited>
Long story short: 
functionality of the Debian installer is:
the first user only gains sudo rights, if root account is disabled.

Holger
