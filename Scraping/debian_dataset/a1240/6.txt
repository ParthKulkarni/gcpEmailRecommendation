I understand that debootstrap needs to be fixed. That's only half of the
point:
Unless we also fix stable and various other distros they won't be able
to debootstrap sid via https. Now I grant that it's possibly not that
common, but given how the web now converges on https everywhere, maybe
it is? (deb.debian.org publicly states that it does https even though
that actually goes through the redirector - and ironically it also still
tells to install apt-transport-https because that's the cross-suite
instruction that's needed on stable.)
So keep it for one release maybe?
The other half of the point is that sid is symlinked to various suites,
so when we fix debootstrap we'd have a script divergence for the coming
release.
Kind regards
