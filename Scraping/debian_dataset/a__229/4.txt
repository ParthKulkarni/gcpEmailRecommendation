I've never had a GuruPlug so I cannot really comment but why are you
using the pre-2014 u-boot version?  I cannot remember all the
differences of the u-boot versions of the installation page says you
should upgrade your u-boot before installing Debian.  Maybe you can
give this a try.
Based on the logs you posted, it seems to me that the kernel and
ramdisk are loaded but the kernel doesn't see the ramdisk, leading to
the "no root" issue.
