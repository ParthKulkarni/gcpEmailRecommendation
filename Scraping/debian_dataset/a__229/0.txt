HW: Guruplug Server plus with JTAG-box (ARMv5-family)
Debian U-boot version: Armel stretch (buster u-boot version freezes when 
setting ethact IP-addresses), original U-boot pre-2014
Problem: When trying to launch d-i (stretch&buster, with instructions 
from Martin Michlmayr webpages) from USB-stick or memory (tftp-load), 
installer freezes with text "Uncompressing Linux". Original U-boot 
version pre-2014 has a documented bug with old u-boot versions variables 
(bootm_size value). Setting initrd_high/fdt_high 0xffffffff to fix 
doesn't help.
When FDT-blob loaded to fix problem(addres 0x0c000000)kernel founds fdt 
and uInird and starts obviously normally but won't read command line 
parametres from fdt-memory area as should (using original default fdt 
instead), and cannot find root file system (on default fdt-file root 
filesystem is not defined).
Seems that U-boot sets and finds command line parametres to/from fdt 
normally, but kernel doesn't use it. (maybe d-i kernel configured for 
statical fdt?)
Reference: Globalscale Fedora 11 (+ OpenDC) development package works 
and installs (unfortunatelly very old) system without major problems 
(minor changes with MAC-address space defaults to perl script needed) -> 
HW probably OK
Is there any fix-up/work-aroud trick available or is new kernel 
compiling only option?
