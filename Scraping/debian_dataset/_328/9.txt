Indeed, I was once again wise-ass where I should be wise[1] -- at least some

I do disagree here, but I'll better pause talking in this thread to let the

I went through your packages (57 sources, 251 binaries), and found no
issues (I only skimmed through nvidia stuff, though).  So if I'm going to
bark at anyone, it's not at you. :)
