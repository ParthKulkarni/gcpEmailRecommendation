Yes, this.  Experienced users can also turn off installation of
Recommends, so I think the focus should be on making things work "as
expected" for people who don't want to understand the details.
There's also a huge difference, given this criteria, betweeen wasted disk
space and running daemons.  I think the latter is worth trying to track
down; the former seems largely futile to me.  All of the disk space gains
you might conceivably get from, say, removing the recommeds on
libmail-sendmail-perl from po-debconf will be dwarfed by minor changes to
the documentation of some other package on your system, or some new
feature in some standard library.

Amen.

Ah, good call.  So this one really should be a bug report.
https://bugs.debian.org/864310 -- please feel free to weigh in and correct
me if I got any of the details wrong.
