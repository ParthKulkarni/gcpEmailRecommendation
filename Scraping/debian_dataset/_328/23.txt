I don't understand what is debatable here.  Please consider filing a 
bugreport against licensecheck to start that debate (if not here).

The very purpose of Noto fonts is large coverage (no "tofu" chars), and 
the very purpose of "fonts-noto" package specifically is described as 
"Use this package if you want all Noto fonts".  If you disagree with 
that, then avoid fonts-noto altogether, don't try redefine its prupose.

Because some (most except you, I guess!) don't consider PDF "obsolete".

We should not actively make GnuPG _harder_ for newcomers to use.

This and other lib*-xs-perl recommendations are faster implementations 
that you commonly want: An example (exotic!) need for avoiding those is 
when bootstrapping a new architecture.
