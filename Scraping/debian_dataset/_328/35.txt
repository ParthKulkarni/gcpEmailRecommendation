	FWIW, I agree wholeheartedly with this one.  (The only reason I
	don’t have ‘complete -r’ in my ~/.bashrc is that bash-completion
	is rarely if ever installed on the systems I frequently use.)

	The latter seems like a good enough reason for this dependency.

	Probably a relic of the days long gone; I guess it should be
	updated to include some more alternatives (in preference to
	freepats) – so long as timidity can (be made to) actually use
	any of them “out-of-box.”

 It is, however, the sole DFSG-compliant patch set in existence so far.
 New patches (including those in better formats, such as SF2 SoundFont banks)
 are welcome.

	Fortran is still widely used (in niche applications; WRF comes
	to mind), but I see no good reason for this dependency.

	So that one can $ convert  pic.ps pic.png?  Or (I suspect)
	$ convert  file.pdf file.png, for that matter.
	(Or perhaps more sensibly: $ display  pic.ps pic.pdf.)
	Moreover, PostScript is a programming (code) language – not a
	(data) format.
	I’m neutral on this dependency, though.  I do like PostScript
	for a document format as much as I do like JavaScript for the
	same, but I see how it may be nice to support .ps (and .pdf?)
	rasterization in ImageMagick and Gimp “out-of-box.”

	Well, ‘locales’ is about 9 MiB in the same, so…

	That’s only Installed-Size: 71, so I don’t see much of a
	problem.  AIUI, libwww-perl (as per upstream) had the
	HTTP::Daemon library for decades, thus not installing one by
	default in Debian may easily surprise an unsuspecting user.

	I suppose that’s so one’s Perl script can be Architecture: all,
	instead of depending on either pure-Perl or an XS (binary)
	implementation of the package – depending on the architecture.

	My exact reaction on seeing that Mutt transitively Depends: on
	GnuPG – all thanks to libgpgme11 depending on the latter.
	I do not know about this specific case, but I very much agree
	with the principle.

	That’s Abstract Syntax Notation One (or ASN.1), and while I use
	it all the time (notation, that is; not this specific library at
	the moment), I see no reason for a -dev package to depend on a
	-doc one any stronger than with a mere Suggests:.

	Makes even less sense when installing libuuid1-depending
	software in a chroot – the one you do not intend to start
	daemons from, like, ever.

	AFAICT, the trend was to never ever rely on DTDs in newer XML
	formats and files, so this one’s only value is probably in
	enabling support for legacy XML.
