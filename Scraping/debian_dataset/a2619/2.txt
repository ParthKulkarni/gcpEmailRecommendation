Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.90
Severity: normal
There's a good chance that the devicetree file for one version of the
kernel will not work with another version. I suspect this was the case,
and confirmed it today when my cubietruck failed to boot with mismatched
versions.
So, it would be good if /etc/flash-kernel/dtbs could prefer a filename
with the kernel version in it, over the unversioned file.
