Dear ports maintainer,
The ftpmaster team would like to clarify which Debian ports should
and/or would like to continue to be part of Debian unstable and
experimental.
As outlined on the Debian Archive Criteria page[0], the key points to
consider are whether the architecture has been part of a stable release,
whether it is *likely* to be part of a stable release, as well as
whether it currently has a sensible number of active maintainers.
Whilst you may be happy to continue the work of maintaining the port
regardless, don't forget that excess or otherwise unnecessary
architectures involve a shared maintenance burden as well as incurring
non-trivial requirements on mirror/Debian resources.
The statistics and graphs available on the debian-ports page[1] may
provide some objective statistics or reflection on the actual
suitability of your architecture's continued inclusion.
So, in the first instance, would you like to continue being part of
unstable/experimental?
