For my part, I was not talking about that patch, but about the
hurd-related patches.
For others, I can simply quote what was said:

And I agree with it (and also one of the reasons why I didn't just
NMU-ed cmake with the hurd patch).

He is not rejecting things, he is saying that belongs to upstream, which
is true.  Help with that and things will flow.

Nope.
