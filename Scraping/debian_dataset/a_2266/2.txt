Yeah, that's why the high number of false positives.  I expect the vast
majority of ISA extension users to implement such a fallback.  There are,
though, some quite prominent exceptions like chromium-browser on i386
(sse2) or rustc compiled software (new versions of firefox) on armhf (neon)
that have a hard dependency.
Thus, it'd be nice to have a way to automatically detect such cases, but I
don't know of a anything better than testing manually.  Which is extra unfun
as any pre-sse2 (or pre-sse3) machine is crummy to the extreme, making
unaccelerated qemu significantly faster than real silicon.  And neither is
fast enough to not make such testing a pain in the posterior.
Meow!
