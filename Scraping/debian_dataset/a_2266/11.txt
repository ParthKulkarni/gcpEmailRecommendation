You cannot reliably do this, e.g. the bad instructions might be used 
only in some part of the program/library that the testing doesn't hit.
One nice part about including it in lintian is that this gives the 
maintainer a standard way to indicate that the package had been
confirmed to only select such instructions after autodetection of
the cpu features by adding a lintian override.
