The problem is not the technical implementation, the problem is that
no longer considering these issues as bugs will quickly result in a 
fractured archive.
Packages that genuinely cannot work on the architecture baseline are
very rare, these are a tiny part of the packages that are not binary-any.
Quite common are possible performance gains by violating the baseline.
Do we want to continue to push upstreams to support runtime detection,
or do we accept that large parts of the archive might stop working on
the architecture baseline?
To give an example of the problem:
We likely have multimedia libraries that are dependencies of many 
packages, that do not have CPU autodetection, and where enabling 
unconditional usage of AVX on amd64/i386 would bring significant 
performance improvements.
Would a dependency on avx-support [any-i386 any-amd64]
be OK for such a library?
Would a dependency on avx-512-ifma-support [any-i386 any-amd64]
be OK for such a library?
