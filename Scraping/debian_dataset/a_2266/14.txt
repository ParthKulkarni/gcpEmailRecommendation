How about:
    ASSUME_ISAS=sse2 apt install Â»packageÂ«
i.e. with the ability to specify the set you expect/know that the
target machine will have. It could support "all" as well of course.
What is the expected interaction with the hwcaps based library
installed paths? (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/{sse2,cmov}). Presumably
libraries would still be expected to use those as appropriate?
