Thanks, that's a really useful effort.

There are groups of packages (Go, gcl, haskell) that are either buggy 
due to one bug or can be whitelisted together.
The majority of packages in the amd64 list seem to be binaries built by Go.
I checked one case in a package, and that was code with proper runtime 
detection copied from golang-1.8 (Go doesn't have shared libraries).
Something like skipping binaries based on "objdump -t --section=.gosymtab" 
could whitelist these.
