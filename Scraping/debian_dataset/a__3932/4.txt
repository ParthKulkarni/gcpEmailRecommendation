Hi all,
I have searched for non-free licensed IETF RFCs in the archive and found
the files below in the stretch suite.  Compare earlier work here [1].
I know this is late in the release cycle, but I believe these are real
RC bugs so it appears to me that bug reports should be filed.  I post
this here first to confirm my understanding that this is the appropriate
way to act.  If some policy has changed that makes this not a problem
anymore, let me know.  I'm okay to file these bugs as stretch-ignore to
not uphold the release, if that makes the release team happier.  I wish
I had looked earlier, but it seems an imminent release triggers various
old habbits.
One interesting aspect is that almost all of the RFCs below are the zlib
RFC1950-RFC1952 documents.  They contain this clause:
   Copyright (c) 1996 L. Peter Deutsch and Jean-Loup Gailly
   Permission is granted to copy and distribute this document for any
   purpose and without charge, including translations into other
   languages and incorporation into compilations, provided that the
   copyright notice and this notice are preserved, and that any
   substantive changes or deletions from the original are clearly
   marked.
This does not clearly grant the right to modify the document and
redistribute the result.  Further, I believe the IETF Trust claim
copyright on all RFCs, even older documents, so the content of the RFC
itself may not be the entire story.  It might be wortwhile to reach out
to the authors to see if they can publish the documents under a clear
and DFSG-compatible license.  I don't have time for this though,
volunteers welcome.
