Dear Guillem,
Thank you for pointing in the right direction.
The first thing I wanted to find out, the separation of changelogs
happened in 1998 according to dpkg changelogs.
dpkg (1.4.0.22) frozen unstable; urgency=medium
  * Non-maintainer bug-fix release
  * Install main changelog file as `changelog.gz' instead of
    `changelog.dpkg.gz' (Debian Policy, section 5.8) (Bug#6052,15157)
.......

And the earliest mention as correctly pointed out by you started In
August 1994 itself.
Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)
..........
..........
ChangeLog begins Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994 for dpkg 0.93.5.
which means it was there from starting itself.
Thank you again for sharing that.
