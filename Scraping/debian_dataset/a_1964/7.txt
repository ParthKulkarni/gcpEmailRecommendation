To the best of my knowledge, Debian changes were never recorded by
editing the upstream changelog file; that would have been silly, and not
at all the path of least resistance (bear in mind that the plethora of
patch management tools we have nowadays mostly didn't exist then, so
maintaining patches against a frequently-changing file such as a
changelog would have been pretty cumbersome).
It did take a little while for the current format to evolve.  For
example, very early source packages had changes recorded in a
"debian.README" file in somewhat ad-hoc formats.
I think the current changelog format arrived with dpkg 1.3.x in August
1996 (https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1996/08/msg00369.html etc.),
but true old-timers might remember more.

You can find old releases on http://archive.debian.org/debian/, as far
back as 0.93R6.  The recognisable modern(-ish) source package format
wasn't around until Debian 1.2.

I don't think you should claim this as a Debian innovation.  For
example, early Slackware releases had a changelog separate from upstream
changelogs, even if it was (and I think still is) distribution-wide
rather than per-package:
  http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/slackware-1.1.2/change.log
Debian *may* have been the first distribution to include
machine-parseable changelogs in a consistent source package format, but
I'm not particularly certain of that.
