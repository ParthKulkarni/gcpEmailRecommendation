Great that you collected that dataset, and put it public.
What would help further would be for such information having references 
to sources, and each information point be referencable (not only the 
dataset as a whole).
In other words, your data gets 2 stars: https://5stardata.info/en/
I maintain https://wiki.debian.org/CheapServerBoxHardware and have for a 
long time wanted to make that 5-star data (currently that has 3 stars). 
Would be great to include your dataset in that, but I would then need to 
know the sources for the datapoints to be able to verify.  Also, ideal 
would be that you maintain your dataset yourself as 5-star reusable data 
instead of me needing to maintain a fork.
A user-visible benefit of 5-star data is the possibility for not only 
browsing it as tabular data, but also navigating multiple dimensions 
e.g. like https://kumu.io/DigLife/digital-life-collective#our-network
Please tell me if interested in helping out, and I will provide concrete 
examples of how to optimally organize data, as soon as I get it 
documented for my own work.
