Yes I knew "findmnt", but it takes a different approach.
lsmount makes it very easy to reduce the information level to the
needed, improves the display with colored columns and alignment
(without forced line breaks) and offers (with -v) a very scripting
friendly output (all configurable on a system-wide and user-level).
"Findmnt", on the other hand, increases the complexity of usage and
only the representation with the switch -l produces a halfway
parseable output.
Also, df is not useless only because findmnt has a switch that
produces a similar output. "do one thing and do it well" I think df
does this for its case and lsmount will do it as well.
I wrote lsmount years ago because I didn't find a tool that gives me a
quick and easy to read overview of the "relevant" mountpoints and can
be used in scripts as well. After SSH on a system where I am not
logged in regularly, it is usually the first command I run to get an
overview.
