I would like to suggest:
    % # clone from salsa
    % git remote add -f upstream https://github.com/google/googletest
    % git merge release-1.8.1
    % dch -v1.8.1-1 New upstream release.
    % git deborig
i.e. make your own tarball rather than putting in so much effort to use
exactly the one from upstream.
