Hi!
I was pointed at Steve's mail yesterday mentioning that he moved
the non-attic repositories of debian-installer to salsa [1].
Since there are still some repositories that we need for debian-ports
in the attic, I was wondering whether we should take care of the
attic stuff and move it over to salsa or github.
FWIW, we are in the progress of moving the sparc* and ppc* ports
which aren't on GRUB yet fully over. In fact, GRUB works fine on
all SPARC boxes we have tested so far, so at least silo-installer
won't be needed anymore in the future. Still, I think we should
archive everything.
Adrian
