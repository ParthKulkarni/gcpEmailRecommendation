Thank you so much for alerting me to ansi2txt. Given the miserable 
failure of some command line tool authors to contemplate terminal 
background colours other than black, I have had to endure all manner of 
workarounds. One investigation revealed ANSI sequences hardcoded in the 
source with no way to turn them off. The horror.
In my view, colour output should not be the default. Anyone who causes 
yellow or light green or, worst of all, white text to be displayed on a 
white background should be dealt with by the a11y police.
Exhibit A: dpkg-buildpackage (attached). This was just the one in front 
of me. There are many more. I should start a collection. I have "export 
TERM=xterm-mono" in my ~/.bashrc.
Another offender is megatools, because who doesn't like progress bars 
with hardcoded ANSI sequences for white and yellow foreground regardless 
of background?:
An appropriate penalty for careless use of ANSI sequences would be for 
offenders to be required to include this in their ~/.bashrc for two years:
dpk-buildpackage-yellow.png
echo -en "\e]10;black\x7\e]11;black\x7"
I think we need an EU Directive.
Kind regards,
