Since Norwegian has two forms of the language, we ship two wordlists.  I
could have gone with «/usr/share/dict/norwegian - New Norwegian» and
«/usr/share/dict/norwegian - book tongue», but I suspect that'd be
considered less helpful than just using bokmål and nynorsk.

There are at least some files in the ca-certificate package that have
non-ASCII names, presumably since the CAs have non-ASCII names.
