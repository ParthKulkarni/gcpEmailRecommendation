Package: debian-installer
is there a reason why the installer defaults to format given swap partition?
I now know that you can opt out to format swap, but i don't understand 
that formatting swap is default!
I had several Linux on same PC and after installing aditional debian, 
the other Linux didn't find their swap anymore because UUID has changed.
I fixed it but i thought: "Debian, that should be a no go, formatting 
given swap"
So i'm curious for the reason for this behaviour!
