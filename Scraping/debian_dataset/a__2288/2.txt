Well 99.9% of installs don't have another linux on the system, so any
swap partition would be a new one that you just created, so you want
it formatted, or it wouldn't be used.
Maybe it would be possible to make it default to not format a swap
partition if that partition already exists and isn't being created
from scratch.
The installer at least has the option to not format it for the extremely
unusual case of wanting to reuse an existing swap partition.
