OK, so I assume there is no feedback about who installed what and how
and when and where ;-)
Why I care at all: In the past, I used to test the Debian installer on
my main computer as it was the only one with up to date hardware, and I
had on it my working OS and a spare installation, and one or two DI
test installations. I found it quite annoying that after each test
the UUID of the swap changed, so I stopped testing DI. 
BTW the 5 people in the world having more than one installation on the
same machine presumably know well how to avoid the potential problems of
shared swap.
