My thinking in advocating for OTHER being 7 (ie, 027 or 077) was that 
the incidents when someone wants OTHER to have access to their files are 
fewer than when they do not want OTHER to have access. Do users 
generally want OTHER to be able to read all their files? Or do they have 
a particular set of files that they want OTHER to be able to 
access/read? In this context it makes more sense to me to put the burden 
on adjusting those specific files that the user wants OTHER to have 
access to instead of having them that way by default. Having to adjust 
those specific files also reinforces to the user what they are doing 
(ie, they are giving the world access to those particular files).
