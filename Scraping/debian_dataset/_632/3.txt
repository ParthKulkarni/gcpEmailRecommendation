I expect for most Debian deployments this isn't that relevant, since
most are either servers with no real users or single-user systems with
no guest account.

This decision was made in the mists of time and has never been questioned.

I think the appropriate default umask is 077 due to the possibility of
some sites not naming the primary group of each user after the user.
That said, 027 would probably be a reasonable default too since most
sites do not do that.

I had "UMASK 027" in /etc/login.defs and I didn't notice that this no
longer works because I also run `umask 027` from my shell
configuration. If you can track down why this no longer works, please
file a bug about it and convince the maintainer to fix it in stretch.
