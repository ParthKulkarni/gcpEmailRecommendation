Busybox upstream does that in https://busybox.net/tinyutils.html

Text from the homepage of dropbear
  Dropbear SSH
  Dropbear is a relatively small SSH server and client. It runs on a
  variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software,
  distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly useful
  for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as wireless
  routers.
That in other words:
  There is an alternative for telnetd
  There is NO need to keep sending clear text passwords ...
