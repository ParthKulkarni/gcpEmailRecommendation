Package: busybox
Version: 1.27.2-1
Severity: wishlist
Tags: patch
Dear Maintainers,
Please consider enabling telnetd in the busybox package. A tiny and
trivial patch to set the config is attached inline. A rebuild with that
change seems to work fine.
As much as I wish it wasn't the case, telnet is still widely used,
especially in the ISP/telco world. Telcos networking engineers expect
to be able to telnet into boxes in their network even today.
Having telnetd available without having to rebuild busybox would be
extremely handy when using Debian (or derivatives) in small boxes (eg:
arm64) inside a telecommunication provider's network.
Thanks!
