I wish that could happen, I swear. Having to support it is just...
"fun". :-(
We tried. Everybody knows it's bad, insecure, generally horrible and
all that. But at the very least until all the network operators trained
by a certain network hardware vendor will retire demand for telnet is
not going away, sadly. I wish I could do anything to change that.

Right now it's an North American provider with a three characters name
;-) But I've yet to find one telco that doesn't demand telnet,
unfortunately. They are not alone in that.
Thanks!
