As much as I don't mind doing weird things in support of weird use
cases, in this particular case I think that would be sending out the
wrong message. We shouldn't do that, IMO, but rather encourage people to
switch to SSH instead of telnet.
It might make sense to add some documentation that explains why telnet
isn't supported, however.
As an aside, can you tell which telco's we are talking about?
