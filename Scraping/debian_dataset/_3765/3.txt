There is one complication: It turns out that in newer versions of apache2, 
mod_http2 does no longer support being used with mpm_prefork but only with 
mpm_worker and mpm_event. If loaded together with mpm_prefork, mod_http2 will 
log a message and refuse to serve HTTP/2, but HTTP/1.x continues to work.
As I don't see any other way to fix the open issues, I would still like to go 
ahead. But I will prepare a new package/diff with a NEWS.Debian entry that 
informs about this change.
Cheers,
Stefan
