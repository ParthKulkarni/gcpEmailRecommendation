If you are running virtualbox on jessie, that would be version 4.3.36.
I do find a lot of problems reported with gnome 3 and virtual box 4.x.
I wonder if virtualbox 5.1.8 in jessie-backports would solve the problem.
I also wonder if having virtualbox 4.x as host with 5.x guest utilities
installed could cause problems (I suspect the guest utilities are
automatically installed and for stretch they would be version 5.x,
not 4.x).
After all gnome3 mandates 3D accaleration, and having drivers that don't
match the hardware (virtualbox in this case) could be a problem.
