So, one should use f.e.
Maintainer: Debian Science Team <cminpack@packages.debian.org>
to indicate it is a team maintained package? The field is not only used
to give a contact address, but also to get an idea who is actually
maintaining a package. For example, I feel much more attracted to fix a
bug in a package that is maintained by a team where I am member of, and
I would like to see this directly instead of needing to search whether
it is among the 1000 Debian Science packages.
If we don't have such a rule, then the Maintainer field is quite
redundant -- at least the mail address there *is* already.
