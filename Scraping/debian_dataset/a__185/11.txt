I agree with your reasoning. I just wanted to highlight that the situation
is in fact worse with the "Team foo <bar@packages.debian.org>" schema: Our
tools do not seem ready for that yet.
For example, have a look at the following packages:
- https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/siridb-server
- https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libcleri
The maintainer box is not even shown. I guess this might be a bug to file
against tracker.debian.org.
On DDPO, it is even more misleading:
- https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=libcleri%40packages.debian.org
People unfamiliar with our tools may believe SiriDB Maintainers are
maintaining one single package, while it is not.
Those two pitfalls were easy to spot, but I believe that there are others.
A team needs a single point of contact and foo@packages.debian.org doesn't
provide that. Or we need other means to identify teams (and using a regexp
on names attached to an email address is not a solution).
I am happy that listmasters clarified their position on this matter in the
meantime. But if we really want to reduce traffic on discussion mailing-lists,
I think that realistic proposals should build upon the notion of teams in
tracker.d.o or in gitlab (or both?). Both tools have a notion of a "team"
or a "group" and could provide an email alias for member subscribed or
member of those groups. I believe this would address the need of most teams,
to have a single point of contact. Such aliases would help us to avoid bug
notifications and alike on discussion MLs.
Best,
