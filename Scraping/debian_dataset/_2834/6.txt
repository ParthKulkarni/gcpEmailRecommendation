Just stumbled over some removals:
GnuCash removed from testing in August 2017
FreeCad removed from testing in October 2017
no sign of any effort to readd them in sight ...

Those packages above are useful today, they even mark the most advanced
programs in their respective domain

The point here is "interested maintainer". I concur it would have been
easy to bring them back, but it did not happen.
Depleting the next stable release from highly productive packages seems
not the most sensible approach to me ...
