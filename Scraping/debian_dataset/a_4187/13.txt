This is the first I'd heard of this being a policy question.  How
about you discuss the team policy and the reasons behind it on
d-policy CC the javascript list.  If you wish to retain the policy,
but ftpmaster disagree with it, you can escalate the policy question
to the TC.
The TC are empowered to "Decide on any matter of technical policy".
If the TC endorse your policy then I don't doubt that ftpmaster will
stop rejecting packages for complying with it.
