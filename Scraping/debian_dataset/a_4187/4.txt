Thanks for the clarification. I was thinking about it more like how the
courts work in India (possibly in other countries too). When a single
judge decides on a case, there is always an option to appeal to larger
bench (more number of judges).
The team as a whole has to weigh in only when the decision of a single
team member is challenged and such a review is requested.
There are also cases the same criteria was applied differently by two
different ftp masters. node-babel-preset-env was rejected for depending
on itself, but node-rollup was accepted even though it depended on
rollup (a binary package created by node-rollup).
I don't think it is healthy to not have an option of reviewing
individual members decisions.
That leaves me only GR as a possible escalation route. I will think
about it.
