I wonder why you think "a single ftpmaster". We are a team. We closely
coordinate what we do and how we do it. When one of us rejects, the team
rejects - it just happens to be a random one of us doing it. Others do
not need to get involved and review everything. Or we wouldn't ever be
able to get anything done if each of us always has to weight in on any
single issue.
