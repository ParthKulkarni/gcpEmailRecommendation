Indeed, apparently I forgot to add documentation. I have submitted
patch, thanks.

Actually I was thinking that it could be part of gnuplot (it has "set
terminal dumb", but it could have a "set terminal braille"), but a very
simple script that emits histograms from basic data makes sense to me
too. I was wondering whether such simple tool already exist, using just
ASCII to produce the histograms, but couldn't find one with a quick
search.
It would probably be useful to make such tool have an optional ASCII
mode. It should also not assume UTF-8 output, but use something like "|
iconv -f utf-8", since chinese people have their own way of encoding
unicode.
