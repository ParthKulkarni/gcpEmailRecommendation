Hi,
2017-12-27 21:27 Ole Streicher:
Member of Aptitude, SDL and OpenSceneGraph teams here (among others),
all of them with lists in Alioth, SDL as an umbrella of 10~15 packages.
Apart from receiving bug reports, we sometimes discuss things in the
mailing list, and for me it's handy to have everything in a single place
(discussions and bug reports).  Also, in this way we do not not have to
subscribe individually to many different packages, and we do not have to
make the effort to subscribe individually when new packages come into
the umbrella.
I don't think that this way of working it's replaceable with another
workflow explained in this thread, although I admit that I haven't been
following very closely every single message.
If the idea is *not* to move those to @lists.d.o, I cannot see what we
should be using instead.
Any recommendation?
Cheers.
