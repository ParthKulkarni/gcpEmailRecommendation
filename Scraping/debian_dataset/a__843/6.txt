Package: dpkg-dev
More and more packages are adding unicode files as unicode support has
become more reliable and available.  The package building process is not
guaranteed to happen in a unicode locale since the Debian default locale
is LC_ALL=C, which is ASCII not UTF-8.  Reading UTF-8 filenames when the
system is using ASCII causes errors (Python makes them very visible, for
example).
mbiebl, youpi, wRAR, bunk, and I had a discussion in #debian-devel.  It
looks like setting the default locale to C.UTF-8 in dpkg-buildpackage is
an easy way to improve this situation a lot.  Any package that needs an
encoding besides UTF-8 could always set it by adding something like this
to debian/rules:
  export LC_ALL = C
Setting C.UTF-8 as the global default in Debian would be the best
solution to this and many other issues, but that's a much much larger
project:
