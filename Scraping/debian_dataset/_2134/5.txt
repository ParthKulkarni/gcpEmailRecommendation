I believe we _do_ provide rather deterministic installs with "large 
enough set of packages supporting as many use cases as reasonable".
 * "Gnome desktop": Larger install reasonable for newer, bigger 
   desktop systems (i.e. not for older/smaller systems)
 * "LXDE desktop": Smaller install reasonable for older hardware 
   (obviously "smaller"  implies "covers less corner cases")
You chose LXDE.  Your described success rate of features covered seems 
reasonable to me, given that choice.
