Standards-Version is purely informational. All packages are expected to
comply with the latest policy, and respectively, when policy changes are
proposed, we are careful to check what packages are impacted and what
should be done about them. If the change is minor, often a lintian
warning is enough. Otherwise bugs are reported
So it is not a big problem if one update Standards-Version without actually
checking policy, as long as one check the lintian warnings and the BTS.
On the other hand it should not be done in NMU, because some
maintainers use this field to track of far they checked the
upgrading-checklist file for this package.
So I agree that updating S-V should never block uploading other
improvements.
