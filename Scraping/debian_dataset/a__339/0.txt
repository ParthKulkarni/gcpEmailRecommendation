Package: debian-installer
Version: 20180610
Severity: grave
I tried to install Debian Testing on VirtualBox using a weekly build of Debian 
Installer. Everything went OK until the disk partitioning stage. In this 
stage, installer warned me that the kernel doesn't support LVM and I should 
load lvm-mod. Then, I didn't found an option to format a partition as Ext4 
filesystem. Automatical installation allowed to create an Ext4 root partition, 
but after writing the changes to disk it says something like "cannot mount /".
