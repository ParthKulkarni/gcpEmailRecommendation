I re-read Ian's e-mail and realised I wasn't quite fair to you, either :)
Ian did claim that dgit gives you one workflow for all Debian packages.
It does indeed provide that.  What I should have said was that it does
not enforce /that/ workflow; it just makes it available, primarily for
the benefit of NMUers and those who aren't already Debian contributors.
