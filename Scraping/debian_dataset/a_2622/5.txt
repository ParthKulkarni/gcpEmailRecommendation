Our friends at SUSE have a script that automatically generates portions of
an AppArmor profile for Samba based on the Samba configuration:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=688040
I'm not entirely sold on the idea, as a hand-authored security policy
can serve as belt-and-suspenders against misconfiguration or a broken
management system that allows unauthenticated users to create too-wide
shares.
The usability gain is undeniable.
