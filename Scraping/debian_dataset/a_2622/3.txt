Thanks for this pointer!  
Adding these two links [1], [2] on that page might be helpful.  I found
them by following links to [3].
As a side note, my laptop runs testing, and I allowed apparmor to be
enabled when that change hit testing.  The only issue I have noticed so
far is that smbd would not have access to some (intentionally public,
not in /home) shares if it were in enforce mode, rather than complain
mode.  If I were not aware of apparmor, and if smbd were in enforce
mode, I would have had a difficult time tracking this down.
Is there a way that an app (e.g. smbd) whose file access requirements
change dynamically through admin and user configuration can at least
inspect its own apparmor profile and give the user a clue that the admin
must update the profile?  For Samba, perhaps at least a comment in
/etc/samba/smb.conf at "Share Definitions" giving a reminder that if any
LSM is enabled, the LSM config may need to be updated to reflect changes
to shares.
