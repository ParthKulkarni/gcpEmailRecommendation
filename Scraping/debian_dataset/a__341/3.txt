wheezy (Debian 7) to jessie (Debian 8) is only one release cycle. I would
expect a wheezy chroot to run well on a jessie kernel. I'd suggest
using some chroot wrapper like schroot, or perhaps a more elaborate
OS-container like lxc.
However, if you're concerned about using chroots, a wheezy virtual
machine on a jessie host is definitely something that can work well.
There are several approaches to this; I like libvirt-bin and its
virt-manager GUI.
Working with a copy of your valuable data rather than the original is
usually also a good idea :-)
