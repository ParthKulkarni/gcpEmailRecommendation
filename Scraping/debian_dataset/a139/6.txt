I might not have been complaining here, but I'm also not that happy
about some removals, and I don't understand the resistance to let
someone adopt the package. Adrian is obviously dedicated to maintain
the package, and in this (and other cases with gnome2 related packages)
there are no RC bugs or known security problems. 
I have ported two packages away from gconf, but it would be better to
have at least the posibility to read the gconf configuration, to be
able to convert it to a new backend. If only for that keeping gconf for
the next release cycle is a good thing, and thank you, Adrian, for
stepping up to adopt the package.
best,
Gert
