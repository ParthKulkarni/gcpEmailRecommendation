To move forward on the technical fix for the primary issue raised in
this thread, let me repeat and restate:
It looks like we will want to have a librsvg-c source package to build
the older librsvg for architectures that don't support Rust yet.
While the Debian GNOME team could maintain librsvg-c's packaging
alongside librsvg, I'd be happier if someone who cares more about
ports would maintain it. Any volunteers?
At a minimum, I don't have an easy way to do the initial binary build
of librsvg-c required for the NEW queue.
Thanks,
