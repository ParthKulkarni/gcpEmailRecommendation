The "browser exception" applies to Chromium and Firefox, which are
standalone packages (sans a few addons breaking), but unless webkit
provides a long term branch with API stability guarantees, that's
not a workable. "Rebase to a new 2.x branch every six months and let's
hope that it doesn't break any rdeps" is not a workable solution.
