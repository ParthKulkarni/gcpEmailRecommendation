I don't think Debian can answer that question and suggest to ask the
pool operators.  This seems to be the correct list:
  https://lists.ntp.org/listinfo/pool
A related question is the use of API keys that are included in some
packages (e.g. chromium).  These are also vendor-specific, but cannot
be really secret (as they are included in the binaries and could be
extracted even for proprietary software).
