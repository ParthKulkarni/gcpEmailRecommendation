 +Note that apt will also let you merge                                                                          
 +main, contrib, and non-free so you can have restricted packages                                                
 +(strictly spoken not belonging to &debian;) as well as packages from                                           
 +&debian-gnu; at the same time.
I would have "strictly speaking not belonging to...". I cannot recollect
