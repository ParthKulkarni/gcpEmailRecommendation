Hi,

Could this be due to latest kernel updates? 4.9.6-x were accepted on
the 27/28th. You could either use rescue mode or redo an installation,
and in /target (before rebooting into the installed system), try
installing an older version of the linux-image package. Older binaries
are available on snapshots:
  http://snapshot.debian.org/package/linux/
Anyway, I think this should be filed against src:linux since the
installation process itself seems to have worked fine. Feel free to
reassign once you have found in which version the regression was
introduced (if that's indeed a regression).
