AFAIK 4.9.6-x is not yet provided in the daily image for ppc64el. It's still the 4.9.2-2.
Anyway, I ran a couple of tests with 4.9.6-3 and 4.8.15-2, and I got the same error.
I did another install but this time I took the previous version of systemd, 232-8 instead of 232-14 (current version), and it worked.

I'll reassign this to systemd.
