Please tell also about the hardware, particular the disks.
Some examples:
A: Hardware is a server like  desktop.
   It has several SATA Controllers on the mainboard.
   Almost each SATA Controller has a disk connected
B: Hardware is a "desktop"
   Amount of onboard disk controller was not enough.
   Extra disk controller card was inserted
C: Hardware is laptop alike
   Beside inside disks
   were extra disks added throught USB connection
D: Another short description
In other words: Do not feel obligated to make a detailed hardware report
