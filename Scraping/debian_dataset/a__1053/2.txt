Package: debian-installer
Severity: critical
Tags: d-i
Justification: breaks the whole system
I installed '/' on /dev/sdc. The installer defaulted to also install 
grub there. I accepted. The system was not bootable. 
The bios setup for boot device priority choice for 
'hard drive' is limited to simply 'hard drive', which I 
assume is the first hard drive. 
I expected the default would create a bootable system.
I booted the install media and installed grub to /dev/sda.
The system then booted.
Perhaps there is some scenario where it would be desirable 
to put grub on the drive with '/' even if it isn't the first drive,
but that certainly isn't the most common scenario.
I wish the installed would default to install grub to /dev/sda, regardless
of where '/' is.
