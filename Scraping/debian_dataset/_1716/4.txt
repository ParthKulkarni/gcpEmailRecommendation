Apparently this can be caused by something like logrotate sending many
"reload" signals to apache in quick succession:
<https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2626601>
I experienced such an apache crash this morning when the logs were
rotated.  I've now adjusted my logrotate config to only reload apache
once (despite many sections for different web site's logs, some of which
have specifically different user/group settings for the files) and will
see if that avoids another crash tomorrow.
