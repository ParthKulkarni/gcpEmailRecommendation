maybe i missed something, but I need to ask some further questions about
this.
So far I've read the overview on alioth-lists.d.n [1] the correct
address to get in contact for requests like this is
mailman@alioth-lists.debian.net.
We have two old mailing list from the pkg-giraffe-group that aren't
migrated (and we have no migration related questing found in the inbox)
so I've wrote a email some days ago about this and also a wishlist's
question if the lists could still be migrated targeted to this address.
But I haven't a feedback yet. So, need I to be more patient or tried I
the wrong contact for such late migrations?
The wiki page [2] nor the information on alioth-lists.d.n [3] hold some
information about how the possibilities are for such possible migrations
after the main change. What need people to do with a similar situation?
