I've been watching my FTP team mailbox for new uploads with dead addresses due 
to alioth lists going away.  Yesterday and today it was 5 RC bugs and one 
package rejected from New.
Please, check you've got a working maintainer address before doing a new 
upload.  You'll end up waiting a long time for the Accepted mail if you don't.
