Sorry, no. You downgraded "missing build-depends"-type bugs several
times, and somebody else had to tell you that they were RC.
Example: gnupg. You did not believe that gnupg was not essential and
argued and argued and argued until a Release Manager told you clearly
that missing build-depends are RC.
There was also a missing build-conflicts bug that you downgraded and
somebody else had to tell you that it was wrong as well.
So it's not me who is handling severities wrong.

No. I assume RC when it is a FTBFS bug and I can reproduce it in
several different computers.
There is no such thing as a "majority of people" when your single and
only source for "buildability" is buildd.debian.org.
A successful build in buildd.debian.org means *nothing*.
Buildds may have packages installed which are not build-essential.
Buildds may be running jessie while I am already running stretch.
Etc.

Sorry, it is not responsible at all to have a flaky test make the
whole build to fail.
If you get annoyed by flaky tests making the build to fail, do not let
the test to make the build to fail, but don't blame me for the annoyance
that the test fails.
Thanks.
