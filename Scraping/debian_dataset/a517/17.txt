As just someone who mostly maintains one package (fio - flexible I/O 
tester) I can certainly understand how you feel about that Lucas removed 
you as a maintainer. Even after all my experience with letting go I bet 
at least initially I would feel quite similar in case someone did this 
to one of the packages I maintain.
While I do not agree to everything you wrote I think it was harmful when 
other members of the community apparently tried to find everything that 
you â€“ in their opinion â€“ did wrong.
Right now I do feel somewhat disturbed about the tone of some mails in 
this thread as I received it. From my experience in other communities 
like KDE or Devuan as well as (at many other times or other places) also 
Debian I know it is possible to discuss and work together in a more 
constructive way.
Howeverâ€¦

I wonder whether you let others move you into a victim position ("OK, I 
got the messageâ€¦" and "no need to apologize" as in I want an apology in 
order to be happy again). I think an apology towards you would be 
appropriate and helpful here. However IÂ´d ask myself whether depending 
on it would be helpful for me.
I noticed a lot of blaming in this thread from quite some people. 
Howeverâ€¦ all that blaming does it to fix the current situation in place. 
Cause blaming is moving all power to the other party aka "if only they 
would change, I would be okay". However, it does not work that way.
I appreciate that you did your best to own your actions and while I do 
not use gjots2 and I am not sure I use one of your other packages I 
appreciate and am thankful for the effort you spent on Debian packages.
Thank you.
I do not advice you how to deal with what you experienced and I can 
certainly understand if you are not that motivated to move on with 
contributing to Debian at the moment.
Debian got as big and successful as it is due to a lot of people working 
on it. Blaming each other is not going to help. We are all in this human 
experience togetherâ€¦ no one is any more perfect or less perfect than the 
other. I wonder what is beyond right or wrongâ€¦ and whether what happened 
may be just be what happened without it being the fault of anybody. 
Fault-free livingâ€¦ how could that look like?
Thank you.
