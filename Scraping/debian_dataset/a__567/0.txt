DMARC/SPF don't have to deny bounces to achieve good security as long as
the original email was sent from a Debian MTA and signed with DKIM.
You can use DMARC to say that all outgoing Debian emails will be signed
by a domain key.
This means: If there is an email signed by debian.org's domain key that
pretends to come from aviau@debian.org, then the owner of the debian.org
domain has done due diligence to verify that aviau actually wanted to
send that email (for example by allowing me to set an SMTP password in
db.debian.org).
Read about DKIM here:
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail
DKIM was actually used in the past verify that leaked emails were legit:
 - https://wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html
DMARC, SPF and DKIM can be used together prevent almost all scenarios of
debian.org email spoofing.
