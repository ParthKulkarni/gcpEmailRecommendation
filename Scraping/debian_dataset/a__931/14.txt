Installing either stretch or buster via netinst results in changes to
the bios menu. Under "UEFI Boot Sources" the term "Hard Drive" is
replaced with "debian" and this entry is put first in the boot order.
The PC is:
Hewlett-Packard HP Pro 3400 Series MT/2ABF, BIOS 7.16 03/23/2012
Please tell me the justification for putting "debian" in the menu and
having it boot first, ahead of CD/DVD/USB. Thanks.
