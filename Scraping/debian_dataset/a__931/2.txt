Preamble: this mailinglist is about software development of the installer
The idea of an install is to get the computer working with that installation.
What I understand from the "Please tell me" request, is that goal accomplished.
But I also recieve a "It is not optimal for original poster".
My advice to OP: Take some time to write down your optimum.
