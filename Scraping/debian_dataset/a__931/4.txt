Why insert itself anywhere in the first place? The machine booted
before the installation. To start installing, the installation medium
is placed in a CD drive or USB port and the machine is rebooted. During
installation, other OSs are detected by the installer. The installer
forms the grub menu with the latest install first and the other OSs
following. Installer finishes by reminding the admin to remove the
installation medium and it reboots the machine. The latest install
boots unless the admin intervenes. Where in this process is a
requirement to tinker with the UEFI menu?
