How are you supposed to get grub to run at all if you don't add a boot
entry for it?  The grub is installed by this installer after.
There is nothing that makes the latest install boot unless you add it
to the boot order.  On legacy bios it was different because there you
just put what you wanted into the MBR boot sector and the BIOS was
typically configured to boot from the harddisk.  UEFI does not work
that way.  UEFI uses an explicit entry specifying which filename to boot
from which harddisk.  So an entry is created specifying to boot the
grub_x64.efi file from the FAT partition containing the bootloaders.
Now there are some default filenames that UEFI will look for if not
explicitly told, but they are not always supported and most installers
don't use those filenames because it isn't reliable, and the explicit
entry is the official way to do it.
The installer has no way to tell what else was on your system already
and how it booted.
