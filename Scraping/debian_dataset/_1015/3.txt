Sorry for taking so long... after thinking about this a while, your
following proposal sounds pretty good! Thanks for spelling it out!

In the kernel, it's consistantly including the vendor subdir, so we can
update the flash-kernel db to always include the subdir for 64-bit arm.
Even with odd cases are the raspberry pi 3, it seems to handle it pretty
well.
My original thought was to detect if the .dtb was found in a subdir, and
then create the corresponding subdir, but your proposal sounds much
simpler.
It wouldn't surprise me if someday the 32-bit arm stuff gets moved into
subdirs anyways... but we'll handle that if that happens.
live well,
