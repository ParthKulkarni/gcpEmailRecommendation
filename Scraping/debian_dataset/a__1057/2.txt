I just enabled all verbosity in building for fio package so that tools 
that can check whether all the hardening options are in place can find 
the relevant information. It actually was a lintian recommendation to do 
so.
So I think there are two different needs here:
1) automatic tools: grep in the detailed build log.
2) developers: see the relevant stuff.
However, maybe there can be a different way for automatic tools to check 
whether hardening flags are all applied.
