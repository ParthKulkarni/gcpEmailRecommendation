For me, assurance that nobody had interfered with the daily image that I 
will use to install a system. Many systems I install with a daily are 
for testing and get thrown away rather quickly (although often I don't 
know in advance which ones will end up sticking around longer).
One reason in the past I have installed systems with a daily build that 
I know will stick around is due to needing support for new hardware at 
install time, where I couldn't just get an older install on the system 
with a stable d-i and then upgrade the kernel post-install. Usually 
things like drivers for a disk controller, newish filesystem features, 
or network drivers for doing a network install.
The testing alpha/beta/rc releases _do_ get signed right? Maybe that's a 
better solution for the above case where I need something newer than 
stable, but testing would in most cases be "new enough".
d-i.d.o does use https and has it's own Let's Encrypt issued cert, I 
think I could verify the cert and then check that the netboot.tar.gz 
matches the one published in
Looking at the code, it looks like d-n-a already does the latter part I 
guess to prevent cases of download corruption, broken mirrors, etc.
The default di-sources.list uses https for the daily images. And the 
code uses either wget or curl, both of which default to verifying certs 
via the normal system ca list. So it's already doing quite a bit to 
verify even the daily image sources. That's good, but if I was an 
attacker trying to mitm, I'd just need to find the weakest link in the 
CA cartel to issue me a d-i.d.o cert I could use for my mitm mirror.
This is a corner case for sure and if there is no reasonable way to 
solve it I think that's OK.
I think if I wanted to prove to myself the daily image came from debian, 
I could verify the cert used for d-i.d.o was indeed the known debian 
owned one, download the netboot.tar.gz/SHA256SUMS and stick them in the 
cache, and then use the --offline flag.
