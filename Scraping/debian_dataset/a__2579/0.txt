https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/daily-build-overview.html is what
should be advertised. The other one was broken in the first place, and
is only kept for the debian-cd part which wasn't integrated in the
“new” view yet. The web server serving the cdimage logs has been shut
down anyway IIRC from a few weeks ago.
And yeah, nobody maintains /Today…

I don't think that's a reasonable thing to do. Images are built on
porterboxes, centralized on dillon, which is used for quite a number
of other things.
What extra security would signing images bring here?
