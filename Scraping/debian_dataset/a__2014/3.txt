You can certainly do that, but you need to be careful to ensure that
all the binary versions increase with each upload.
All the binary versions certainly need to include the Debian revision.
But also, if you start with:
                  upstream  Debian binary
prerex (Latex)     1         1-1
prerex (utility)  11        11-1
vprerex           21        21-1
and then prerex (Latex) is bumped to 2 but prerex (utility) and vprerex
are not, you mustn't upload with these versions:
                  upstream  Debian binary
prerex (Latex)     2         2-1
prerex (utility)  11        11-1
vprerex           21        21-1
In src:linux we have a somewhat similar situation where usbip was
folded into it upstream, and usbip was previously packaged separately
in Debian so I wanted to preserve its own version numbers.  What I did
there is to set the binary versions to
<upstream-version>+<linux-upstream-version>-<debian-revision>, e.g.
2.0+4.14.7-1 for the latest upload.
Ben.
