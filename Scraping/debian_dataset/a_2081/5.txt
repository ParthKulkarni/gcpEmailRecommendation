You don't know to which mailing lists the person has subscribed and the email 
address they used to subscribe is not always the same they use to email you.
Finally, the hard part is unsubscribing requires the person actively confirming 
this by replying an email that has an obscure subject line "CONFIRM XXXXX"
coming from "SmartList". If they're not aware they have to reply some email
to unsubscribe from Debian lists, they're most likely to ignore it.
