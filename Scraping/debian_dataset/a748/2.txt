This looks okay to me, other than this noise in the diff:
--- xkeyboard-config-2.19.orig/debian/files
+++ xkeyboard-config-2.19/debian/files
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+xkeyboard-config_2.19-1.1_source.buildinfo x11 extra
As the package produces a udeb, this will need an ack from the d-i RM as
well; CCing appropriately.
