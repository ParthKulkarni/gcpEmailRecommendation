There appears to be some confusion here.
stretch/updates is in the security archive and therefore irrelevant to
this discussion.
Before the point release, your upload will be in proposed-updates.
Packages in proposed-updates are available once a member of the Release
Team has accepted them from the stable-new queue. That still requires
users consuming proposed-updates, which most don't.
Finally, stretch-updates is a special distribution which the Release
Team can push packages from proposed-updates to under some
circumstances. That still requires the package to have been accepted
into proposed-updates first as per the above, and I'm not convinced that
this upload would meet the criteria for such a release.
