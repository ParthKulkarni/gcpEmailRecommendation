turns out the latter two here are unrelated issues. 2.2.32 includes this
code:
    /* PR#43039: We shouldn't accept NULL bytes within the line */
    if (strlen(*s) < bytes_handled) {
        return APR_EINVAL;
    }
which is fair, but not directly part of this rewrite, as far as I know
- this seems more related to this patch:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1758671
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/server/protocol.c?r1=1757394&r2=1758671&pathrev=1758671&diff_format=h
I am not sure we should factor this into the package, but without it,
test case #2 is so broken that I am worried it introduces other
regressions, so I bundled it in.
It does mean that "echo GET / | nc localhost 80" now fails, but that
seems to be the design of the Apache team, unfortunately. :( No more
"telnet into port 80" it seems?
I am really wondering why we shouldn't just package 2.2.32 after
all. the change is kind of massive, but it would make me feel much
better than the current patch set:
 136 files changed, 1738 insertions(+), 4409 deletions(-)
I'm running out of hours for this month, unfortunately. I will be able
to continue the work in february, but it would probably be better for
others to pick that up before that.
I have reuploaded a new version of the package with the extra above
patch, and I believe it passes the test suite correctly now.
I am not confident enough to upload the result as is, so I would like
another LTS worker to look into this before a final upload.
Thanks so much for the review and feedback, Stefan!
