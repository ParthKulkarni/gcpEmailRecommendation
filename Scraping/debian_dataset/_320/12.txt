I think these changes should do the trick:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/rootskel.git/log/?h=pu/bug-853855
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/debian-installer-utils.git/log/?h=pu/bug-853855
rootskel: I separated that into two commits (13c865dc & 4f8e64c1) to
          make it more obvious what I did.
di-utils: I've just removed the check for dots, so that they should then
          get included in the target's kernel command line
I'll try to sort out some tests for that later (jenkins just failed to
build an image for some reason).
Cheers, Phil.
