Please do!  At this time, i386 is a trap for newbies who don't know better.
No proper crossgrade tools exist yet, but a good first step is to stop
digging that hole.
No one installs i386 new -- machines that are non-amd64-capable are:
* mainstream machines from 2004 and earlier
* a brief wave of mobile devices, now thankfully gone
* deeply embedded, usually incapable of running d-i
If you're installing on one of them, you're reinstalling a buggered up
system thus know what you're doing.  It's no different from installing on
alpha, mips or powerpc.  Thus, secondary architectures should be kept out
of the view of newbies (with a convenient link for the rest).

I'd vote no -- netinst + packages you need is smaller than an entire DVD.
Those who want to install multiple machines from an image tend to know what
to do -- and even them will typically still download the installer more
times during tests than they have machines to install.
