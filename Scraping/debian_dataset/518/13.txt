Those were mobile CPUs, as in the second entry.

Which is still 9 years ago.
The installed base of 32-bit-only x86 is probably still bigger than all
non-x86 non-ARM together, but I believe a new user trying to install Debian
on such a machine is unlikely enough to warrant hiding this option to help
those who would be better served by amd64.
There's hope that by Buster we'll put arm64 on the front page, but for now I
think Steve McIntyre's idea of making amd64 the only prominently visible
arch is the way to go.
