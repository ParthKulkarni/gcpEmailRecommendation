Hi,
(assuming you mean "Debian" and not "Devian" here, but that doesn't
change much in this case anyway).

I am tired to use windows, and I wanted to start using Devian, but here I saw that the screen reader Orca is kilometers away from NVDA, non visual desktop access, wich is a windows screen reader very fast. NVDA is open source, and it is developed over python
Sadly, that doesn't mean it can easily work on a Linux system. There is
an issue upstream where they stated that they wouldn't work on this for
now: https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/6104

I'm not sure what you mean by "low level of system development". In the
last stable version, you only get orca 3.22, but that's they way stable
work. You can get a more recent version by using testing (buster) but
that's not recommanded for everyone. There are no backports available
currently (https://backports.debian.org/, that would get you 3.28), and
I'm not sure how feasible it would be to backport it without backporting
all of GNOME.
That said, have you checked
https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/ ?
Cheers,
