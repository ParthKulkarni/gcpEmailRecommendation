I'm sorry, I think you have misunderstood my point.  I wasn't
suggesting that *you* should follow the recommendations in those
manpages.
I am saying that for packages whose Debian maintainer follow those
recommendations, much of what you want would be straightforward - or,
anyway a lot easier.  So I was plugging my recommendations.
I was also inviting comment from you as a downstream, if there are
ways recommendations (and tools such as dgit) could be improved.

Not sure what you mean by `your deb branches', but looking at what
Debian gives you:

dgit (dgit clone, dgit fetch) will give you this, regardless of the
maintainer's behaviour.

A maintainer who uses dgit and follows the recommendations in the
dgit-maint-*(7) manpages will give you this.
So I think you should be plugging dgit to maintainers, like I am :-).

dgit will pretty much give you this, regardless of the maintainer's
behavior, because it will automatically convert the `text based
patches' into git commits so the git commits are there.

Again, dgit will give you this.

One of dgit's objectives is to make the work of downstreams easier.
