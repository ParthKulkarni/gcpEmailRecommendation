Hi folks,
I'm often seeing packagers directly putting dfsg'ed trees into their git
repos, w/o any indication how the tree was actually created from the
original releases.
As I'm doing all patching exclusively via git (no text-based patches
anymore - adding my changes ontop the upstream release tag and then
rebasing for new releases), this (amongst other problems like
wild merges) is quite a challenge for efficient (heavily automatic)
handling.
Can we agree on some auomatically reproducable (and inversable)
transformation process from orig to dfsg tree
My preferred way (except for rare cases where upstream history is
extremely huge - like mozilla stuff) would be just branching at the
upstream's release tag and adding commits for removing the non-dfsg
files ontop of that. From that branching the debianized branch,
where all patches are directly applied in git.
