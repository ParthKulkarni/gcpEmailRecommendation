This is rather odd.  Does that mean that you can obtain the same
performance regression by doing the following, very quickly:
 * edit all the source files
 * compile
 * ship it ?
(without strip-nondeterminism, I mean)
If a lot of this kind of thing is going to happen, we are going to
need two timestamps for every source package.
