Package: debootstrap
Severity: normal
Tags: patch
I've wrote some patches, which speed up deboostrap a lot.
Changes are only made to /usr/share/debootstrap/functions, mostly in
the perl part, but also the number of lines that are proceeded by
perl are reduced via egrep.
Here are some time measures on a 4-core machine, the target directory
is inside a tmpfs and a local mirror in the same subnet is used.
old version 1.0.89
real    1m26.940s
user    1m24.180s
sys     0m2.420s
including the patches
real    0m39.481s
user    0m50.444s
sys     0m2.748s
If you have any questions concerning the patches, just ask me.
