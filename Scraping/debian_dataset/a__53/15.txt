For some reason it seems I didn't follow up to this bug report but I'm
pretty sure I did reply on debian-boot@ in some way: we need automated
tests before and after those patches. And we need to make sure they
yield the exact same results. Please don't merge the whole stack of
patches without such checks.
Cheers,
