I understand that; I tend to agree, modulo things not being listed in
/proc/cmdline as below...

Correct; /proc/cmdline exists, but anything set up using:
set kFreebsd.priority=high
set kFreebsd.auto=true
Which appears to me to be the current method for preseeding on the
command-line (ie. at boot time; from grub); these options do not show
up in /proc/cmdline in my testing.
I tried to pass things after boot_one; but did not dig in any farther
than that. There probably is another way to get this to work.

Yeah, I didn't have one of those in my test case. Oops.
