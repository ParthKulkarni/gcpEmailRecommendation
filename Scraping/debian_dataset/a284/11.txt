We wants to stop using the environment because busybox hides it from us...
I don't see the point of continuing to use it.
Can you elaborate on what's wrong with /proc/cmdline on kfreebsd? We know
that it exists. Are you saying that it doesn't contain the actual
parameters passed on the kernel command line at boot time?
I put debian-bsd@lists.debian.org in copy to have their feedback/advice.
Is there any other way to get the parameters passed on the kernel
command line?

At least it does not cope well with parameters without any "=". Try adding
words like "quiet" in the middle of your parameter list. They do not end
up on a line of their own.
I freely admit that my solution is complex but I was not able to find a
simpler one that works well enough with my test case:
language=fr_FR long?='1 2 3' rescue/enable="true" my/description="un message" --- quiet
