That will work on most arches, but not on kfreebsd/*. That said, the
easy fix would be to look at both environment and /proc/cmdline.
I *think* you only really need -e 's/\([^ =]*=[^ "]\)/\n\1/g'  -e
"s/\([^ =]*=[^ ']\)/\n\1/g" to multiline the entries and appropriately
handle any multiword. With my limited testing it seemed to work well,
and would be less complex than your solution ;)
Did I miss some important corner-case?
