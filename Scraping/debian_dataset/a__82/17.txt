git-dpm does too, and I agree it's nice.

It produces a patches-applied tree *and* the separated upstream patches
in debian/patches/.  You never actually touch the latter by hand;
they're purely an export format.
Briefly, when you want to edit upstream patches, you bracket your
operations with "git-dpm checkout-patched" / "git-dpm update-patches";
the update-patches operation constructs a merge of the (possibly
rebased) tip of the patched branch (i.e. upstream source as patched, no
packaging files) into master or whatever you're calling your primary
Debian branch, and arranges for that merge commit to include an updated
export of upstream..patched into quilt-compatible files in
debian/patches/.
I had a mild initial reaction to the duplicated information, but after a
trial run decided that I liked the results easily enough to outweigh
that.

Yes, it absolutely does.  See e.g. openssh if you want to peer at a
medium-sized example.
