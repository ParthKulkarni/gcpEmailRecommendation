When talking about percentages, I think it's worth keeping in mind the
1000% longer that it takes to comprehend a diff of two patches-unapplied
trees (as gbp produces them) over a diff of two patches-applied trees
(as git-dpm and dgit with maint-merge workflow produce). I don't
understand how gbp became so much more popular than git-dpm.
