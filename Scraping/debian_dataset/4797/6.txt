Ah ok. I was simply surprised by the default behavior and was hoping
there was something that could be done to fix it.

So even if we could change it, it would flood everyone's inbox. I
suppose the only solution is to always @mention the package maintainer
when submitting a merge request. I suspect most haven't looked at their
notification settings and so that's probably the only way to guarantee
an email to the maintainer.
