I did not recruit anyone. The students signed up for the workshop and it
was their vacation time. They spent 6 days of their vacation on this
workshop itself shows their commitment. Also the college itself has a
good tradition of Free Software culture. They hosted a mini debconf in
2010 and we did a second mini debconf there last year (in between they
hosted many Free Software events including FUDCON Asia and they are
hosting PyCon India next month).
