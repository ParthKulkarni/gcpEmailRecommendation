Could we maybe hide library packages from apt searches by default? I
think most users don't care about libraries in any language (be it
Perl, C, JS, Python, ...), but only care about software they
use directly. And developers that do care about libraries could pass
a flag to APT to say "yeah, please show me all packages that match
this". And maybe even indicated how many library packages were not
shown in the default search results?

PS: I'm throwing this idea in as a general idea, I don't think this
is something for Stretch though, we're far too late in the release
cycle for that.
