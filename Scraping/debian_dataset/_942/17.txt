After some thinking, instead of hiding better to group by:
$Â apt search gif
[ GUI applicatoins ]
gimp
mirage
...
[ CLI applications ]
gif2png 
gnuift
imagemagick
..
[ programming libraries ]
libgif
libsdl-image
python-pil
..
[ documentation ]
libgif-doc 
...
$ 
I think the data for grouping can be theoretically mined from debtags.
