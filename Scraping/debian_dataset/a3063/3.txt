I think both issues are connected: if we can't trust the InRelease
signature for testing, we can't download packages from this suite in a
secure fashion, hence the ‚ÄúE: Some packages could not be authenticated‚Äù
error?
It might be due to new keys for testing in preparation for buster or
something like this? ISTR we got updated release keys rather late in the
stretch release cycle.
