I was curious, so I ran the following on my laptop:
$ find /usr/share/doc -name '*changelog*' -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -n | tail -n10 | while read size path; do echo $(humanify "$size") "$path"; done
2 MB /usr/share/doc/libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/xserver-common/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/xserver-xephyr/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-core/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-legacy/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/xwayland/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/gimp/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/gimp-data/changelog.gz
2 MB /usr/share/doc/libgimp2.0/changelog.gz
4 MB /usr/share/doc/libvirt0/changelog.gz
While changelogs are sometimes really useful, that's a fair bit of
diskspace on my laptop, and a fair bit of bandwidth to transfer, for
fairly little gain.

I agree that we can drop older changelog entries. I suggest truncating
changelogs, at least large ones, by dropping any entries from before
stable, when uploading to unstable. So uploading to unstable today,
any entries from before stretch can be dropped. When a changelog is
truncated, there should be a URL to the full changelog, so those who
really are curious can find it. (Possibly oldstable would be a better
cut-off point.)
Alternatively, we could change things so that the changelog for each
Debian release (major part of version) is put in its own file.
With this scheme, uploads to unstable today would have
/usr/share/doc/*/changelog.debian10.gz. Once buster is released,
uploads would include changelog.debian11.gz instead. This would allow
a fairly natural rotation.

I'd be OK with using xz -9 to compress changelogs. This would also be
easily doable in debhelper. From the ten files I showed at the
beginning, I get about a 29% savings recompressing as xz.
