There was one comment in favour of keeping these lists, and none for
excluding them.  I intend to continue including them.

There seemed to be consensus that this would be reasonable, but
differing opinions about how to do it.
Several people mentioned Ubuntu's automatically truncated changelogs. 
These would require packaging a new tool and improving the handling of
source changelogs on metadata.ftp-master.debian.org.  I don't have time
to work on this but someone else could.
I've committed a manual change in the linux source package, moving all
entries up to the stretch branch-point into changelog.old.  This will
mean that in a buster installation the changelog will include all
changes since stretch.

There was some support for this, but differing results for compression.
It wasn't clear that the gain would be worth it.  I don't have time to
work on investigating this or proposing a policy change, but someone
else could.
Ben.
