 Thank you for providing script :)
 I've tested it and got failure. However, I could fix it a bit by adding
 "sudo mount -t proc none "${suite}.chroot/proc"" after debootstraping.
 Because debootstrap failure is caused by "systemd-machine-id-setup" in
 systemd.postinst, and can improve it with /proc mount.
 Russell, could you test it, please?

 I'm not sure how to run nested chroot with success, it means
 "chroot "/tmp/${suite}" /bin/sh" line would still fail, though.
