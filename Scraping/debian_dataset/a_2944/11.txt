In general it is nice if systems that periodically produce data give
an indication of when they were most recently updated; and even better
if they also report the dates reported by all of their inputs; and say
when they will next poll for updates.  That would probably save a lot
of human effort.
Do we have a standardised format for any of our services to report
this origin timing information ?  (I run only one service in Debian
and it is supposed to always produce up-to-date data...)
