+1
And additionally fiddling with devicetree should be encouraged IMHO as
it allows to do unusual things with those SoC boards, eg. sharing
an IR RX with an UART TX - how should the vendor decide in such cases ?
Also look at the ACPI situation - even main Server vendors firmware
contains bugs not fixed during the livetime of the systems.
So please let the linux kernel tree be the device-tree reference.
Thanks for all the work on device-tree,
 greetings
  Hermann
