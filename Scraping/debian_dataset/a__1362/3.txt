Hello,
it appears to me that this argument assumes a situation that we
simply don't have for many devices.  A lot of the ARM-based
devices that Debian supports don't come with any preinstalled
firmware at all.  Many of them don't even have permanent onboard
storage (such as an SPI NOR flash) in which such a firmware could
be stored, so the firmware is commonly a user-supplied u-boot
image on an SD card.
In practice, for most of the devices supported by Debian/armhf,
the canonical source for the devicetree _is_ the Linux kernel. 
The SoC-manufacturers commonly ship years-old, often
pre-devicetree android kernels and stone-aged hacked-up u-boot
versions without any notion of device-tree for their hardware and
don't really care about mainline Linux.  AIUI, the situation for
arm64-based SBCs appears to be roughly similar - server-class
arm64 hardware is another topic, but Debian doesn't only cater
for server-class hardware but also for a broad base of cheap SBCs
based on SoCs built for the android market.  In some cases the
manufacturer ships a hacked-up 3.10-based android kernel that
even has a device-tree, but the bindings used in there are
partially "homemade" and incompatible with the mainline bindings,
i.e. the device-tree provided by the manufacturer is effectively
unusable with mainline kernels.
For systems supported by mainline u-boot we are slowly getting to
a situation where more and more devices are converted to the
"new" u-boot device-model and use device-tree internally, and
u-boot can provide the u-boot-internal device-tree to the kernel,
but even for many of those the situation is that the support in
the mainline kernel as well as in u-boot is reverse-engineered
and new features get added to the device-tree with every kernel
release as the reverse-engineering efforts go on.
I understand your argument and from the view of server-class
systems it makes sense, but in the field of SBCs that would only
work if we had a proper, fully-featured, standards-compliant
device-tree from the manufacturer right from the start for every
device, which is a situation that we unfortunately don't have
and probably won't have for the forseeable future.

The common case for SBCs is that there is _no_ working
device-tree from the manufacturer.
