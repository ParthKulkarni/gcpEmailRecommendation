Yes, I did that, the planet admins have a wiki about[1] it and I looked
there before posting.  The wiki suggests filing a bug against the
package planet-venus but the service is not running the package and the
bug doesn't exist in the latest package anyway, Planet is running an old
version from 2011.
I was hoping somebody else using Wordpress may remember what options
they selected in their Wordpress settings to make it work
This is what appears in the log for the last poll:
