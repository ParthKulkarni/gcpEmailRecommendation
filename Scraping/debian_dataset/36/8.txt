Hi Roger,

Thanks for asking. Well, I decided to try and get what I was trying to
do without using cross-compilation, and introduce cross-compilation once
I had things working without it. But I got the impression that there
were holes in the official documentation around cross compilation and
thus your wiki page had merit, so thanks for that.
The last thing I did for the issue I was looking at was post to
debian-kernel asking for advice. Alas nobody has had the time to reply.

I'm planning to write up what I've been looking at for a blog post.
