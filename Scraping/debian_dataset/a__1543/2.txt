Hi Simon,
I'm dropping debian-mentors@d.o from the recipients list as I think it
the discussion is not relevant for that list anymore.

Will do, thanks. I thought I added all maintainers individual addresses
at some point in the discussion, but probably I didn't...

I have the package ready, and it works fine without any diversion,
alternatives or other trickery.  It has been surprisingly easy, indeed.
You can get the package here:
https://salsa.debian.org/dnn-guest/dbus-broker
It works fine minus replacing dbus-deamon for the user bus, which
prompted the email at the origin of this thread.  It needs to be done
manually (see README.Debian) or installing a
/etc/systemd/user/dbus.service
symlink. I don't know what's the best strategy, yet.
I'm happy to work with the dbus maintainers to fix any issue.
Incidentally, I will be looking for a sponsor to upload the package to
unstable as soon as I figure out how to solve the above minor issue. It
would be great if someone among the dbus maintainers could act as sponsor.

That would need to be investigated indeed.  So far the package works
well on a couple of very minimal installs I tried it on.
Thanks!  Cheers,
Dan
