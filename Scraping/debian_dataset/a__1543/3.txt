Subject : Systemd user instance equivalent of dh_systemd_enable?

Hello,
I'm working on a package that installs a systemd user instance unit file
that needs to be enabled with
# systemctl --global enable foo.service
Using debhelper, dh_systemd_enable takes care of this automatically for
system unit files, but not for user unit files.  Is there some other
(semi)automatic way of doing it or should I take care of it manually in
the postinst and prerm maintainer scripts?
Thanks! Cheers,
Dan
