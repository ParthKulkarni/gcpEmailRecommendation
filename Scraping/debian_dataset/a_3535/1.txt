Hi,
 Today, I've tried to login salsa.debian.org, 2FA doesn't work well
 (and on github, too). It works several days ago.
 The message on salsa is
>>There was a problem communicating with your device. (error code: 1)
 On my desktop (sid)
 - chrome / chromium / chrome-unstable doesn't work
 - with other user account, it doesn't work, too
 - tried to use another U2F device, both of them don't work
 - boot with Fedora27, it works (so, it's not hardware issue, IMO)
 On my laptop (sid)
 - chrome / chromium works
 Now I can login to salsa on my laptop, but I usually do my work on
 desktop, so I want to solve it.
 Both of them run Debian sid and updated. 
 Any suggestions, or ideas?
