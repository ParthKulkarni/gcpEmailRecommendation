Package: debian-installer
Version: RC3
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
After performing an installation of Stretch RC3, the installation will not
boot.
The problem is that grub is not being invoked correctly. My hardware is two
SATA drives
configured as a single RAID1 array and this array used for one lvm volume
group. Root
(which contains /boot and /usr) is one logical volume.
At the end of the installation I used the installer interface to write the MBR
to BOTH /dev/sda and /dev/sdb.
To fix the problem, I used the installer cd to go into recovery mode. In this
mode I was
able to write the MBR to /dev/sda and /dev/sdb and the installation now boots
normally.
My hardware is intel 64 bit on an ASUS mobo. The kernel is
vmlinuz-4.9.0-2-amd64.
