When I get to the end of the installation process and it's time to
configure grub, I only select one disk, i.e., /dev/sda. To get grub
installed on the second disk I always go through that final part of the
installation again--before it's time to boot the new installation for
the first time--to select the other drive, i.e., /dev/sdb. I can't quite
remember, but I believe the way one selects is to choose one from a menu
(/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/md0), not enter the path in a text field
--which would permit listing both or any other stupid path or paths,
opening up the opportunity to introduce an error.
