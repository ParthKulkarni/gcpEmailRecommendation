Writing to both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb both seemed to work in the normal
fashion during the main install process, which I've done with the Debian
installer many times. There was no error indication.
I fixed the problem by choosing "Advanced Options->Rescue Mode" using
the same installer CD.
After using the prompts to assemble my raid array and choose my root
file system I got to the menu giving me the option to "Reinstall GRUB
boot loader," which I chose.
I ran this option twice, once for /dev/sda and again for /dev/sdb. Based
on what was written on the screen, this was equivalent to running:
grub-install /dev/sd{a|b}. After that, stretch booted.

OK. I found /var/log/installer/syslog. I gzipped it and have attached to
this message. I guess you're asking that I add it to the bug report,
which I'll also try to do.

Since it was so easy for me to fix, I want to think that it wouldn't
take much to tweak the installer to handle this case correctly too. I
hope so, anyway. -- al
