Thanks. I am not sure what the underlying problem with the Ubuntu /usr
issue we noted is, haven't investigated it further on Ubuntu proper.
We just noticed that:
- we got a Busybox at startup (on a clean 18.04 Ubuntu install)
because /usr wasn't mounted properly (it couldn't find the volume)
- /sbin/lvm was linked towards libraries on /usr/lib, making debugging
it hard (since I couldn't run lvscan or anything)
- that problem had its root in the Debian package, which had the same
list of library dependences.
Let's leave this closed for now; I might come back later but I'd need
to investigate this more on a clean Ubuntu 18.04 install and
potentially open an issue with them. Given the usrmerge coming up, the
difference between depending on /lib and /usr/lib might be irrelevant
shortly, as far as Debian is concerned.
Thanks for your feedback and thanks to you also, Adrian.
