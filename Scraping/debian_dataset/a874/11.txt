(Speaking for myself as we did not discuss this on pkg-privacy yet.)
IMO such an effort would fit well under the umbrella of this team but
of course this should be discussed with the team.
I doubt the current team members have enough bandwidth to tackle
this big new task so quite some additional time/energy needs to be
injected into the team for this to work.
