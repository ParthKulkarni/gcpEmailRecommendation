The boot mechanism used by the hd-media tarball is based on a
mainline u-boot feature called "distro_bootcmd", which is enabled
on all modern armhf platforms.  In principle, this feature could
also be enabled in mainline u-boot for armel platforms, but there
are some circumstances that make using this unrealistic for our
current armel targets:
- It requires the use of multiplatform kernels and devicetree
  (as we do on armhf) instead of the platform-specific kernels
  and board files that we have for our traditionally supported
  armel targets.
- Most of our armel targets come with a vendor-uboot in ROM
  that cannot be easily replaced by a current mainline u-boot
  with support for distro_bootcmd.
As a result, we don't build a hd-media tarball for armel.

Karsten
