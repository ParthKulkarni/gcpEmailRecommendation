I fully agree here. It makes pages like
https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=debian-astro-maintainers%40lists.alioth.debian.org
quite nonfunctional. And they are even not simple to restore with the
name, since there is no really canonical name for the teams: The Debian
Astro team is sometimes called (even by myself):
* Debian Astro Maintainers
* Debian Astronomy Maintainers
* Debian Astro team
* Debian Astro Team
etc.
What is unique is just the mail adress.
However, in principle this *may* be the discussion list address. I would
even prefer that, since the package maintainer address is quite
prominently presented everywhere, and therefore often used by people to
contact us. In the debian-astro-maintainers@alioth.d.o this has the
danger to get lost between upload confirmations and bug processing
mails.
To change the team address to the discussion list (@lists.d.o) would
however require that the automated mails (uploads, bug mails) are not
longer forwarded to that address. I also don't see a need for this,
since the subscription on tracker.d.o allows a much more fine-grained
access here.
Are there any plans (or already possibilities) to disable the
processing/bug mail forwarding to the maintainer address?

A team usually has a discussion list, and this is also the point of
contact for a human. I would rather not like to have robots there.
