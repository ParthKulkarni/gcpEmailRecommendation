I don't understand what "support" you think my proposed change
((ii), above) would need, that would be too difficult.
I don't know how often you update from upstream but I doubt the merge
conflicts will be frequent or difficult, and if it's a simple
statically-determined footer then there are few moving parts to go
wrong.
Can you point me to the source code for Salsa's gitlab instance,
please ?
Ian.
