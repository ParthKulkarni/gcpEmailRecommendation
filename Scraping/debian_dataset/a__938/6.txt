Unfortunately I'm on holidays with bad internet connectivity until
August 5th. Will not find time to look into the regression earlier.
Also, I just did further debugging and a final fix to the deb7u8 upload.
I remember that backporting the CVE-2016-8743 fix to 2.2.22 very
intrusive and complex.
Kind regards,
