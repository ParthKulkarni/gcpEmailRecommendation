I would agree as well - we can't possibly watch all of the BTS for such
reports. :)
Honestly, I was surprised there wasn't more pushback on DLA-841-1: it
was a major change with significant impact. The patch was a mess to
backport, and basically rewrote the request parser in Apache (!). It was
bound to introduce more issues.
I'll try to tackle this one, naturally, since I'm the one who issued the
DLA in the end!
sorry about the trouble.
