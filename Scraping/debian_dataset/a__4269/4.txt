In #843906 I suggested removing tftpd because it's inferior to
tftpd-hpa in every respect, and cannot boot some modern computers.
I didn't manage to get around to this earlier but I wonder if it would
still be a good idea, even for stretch.
The actual changes would be:
 * Add one Provides: to tftpd-hpa
 * ftpmaster RM request for tftpd
Am I insane to be contemplating this during the freeze ?
Ian.
