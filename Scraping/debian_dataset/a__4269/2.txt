If you have the spoons to work on a solution now, or at least mock one up, and
it wouldn't distract you from freeze work, I'd encourage you to make a start
now; it'll serve as a better reminder later on for you or someone else to see
it through :)
You might even decide it's not feasible, in which case tftpd->tftpd-hpa
becomes feasible again for stretch.
