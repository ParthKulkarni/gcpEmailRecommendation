It is not the tool here that is the problem. It is the people involved
that are. No matter being on a mailing list or loomio or
whatevermagictool, as long as people are unwilling to accept the other
sides and willing to find consensus, you can throw tools around as much
as you want. You wont get anywhere.
Or simply put:
You can't solve a social problem using technical means.
