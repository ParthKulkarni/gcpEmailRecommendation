Hope things will improve soon.
However, I still cannot understand why the package questioned [0]
didn't start to build for 1+ month.
I uploaded another package yesterday [1], now all arch are built well.
[0] https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=fxlinuxprint
[1] https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shadowsocks-libev
How packages are queued for buildd?
My 1st package seems in low priority list?
Cheers,
