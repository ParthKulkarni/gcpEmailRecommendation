Could someone reiterate about what the current state of init diversity 
is supposed to be? Is it assumed to be best effort of every maintainer 
being required to ship an init script next to the systemd unit that is 
actually used by default[1]? Can we rely on sysvinit users to report the 
bugs with the scripts or how intensively do they need to be tested?
Similarly, are maintainers allowed to ship timer units in lieu of 
cronjobs? As an example I invested some time in 
prometheus-node-exporter[2] to run textfile collectors of monitoring 
data (SMART, apt) in the background. Would I have been required by 
policy to make sure that all of this also works on a system with 
sysvinit? Note that this includes the usage of file presence checks and 
OnBootSec, so I suppose that'd mean both anacron and cron as well as an 
actual shell script that checks for the preconditions. Would anacron and 
cron need to be depended upon in that case or would they could they even 
just be recommended? Both would not be needed on a default Debian system 
that ships with systemd.
"Alternative init implementations must support running SysV init scripts 
as described at System run levels and init.d scripts for compatibility."
