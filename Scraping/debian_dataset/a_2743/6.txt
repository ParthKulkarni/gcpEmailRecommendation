Thanks.  That's very helpful.
I had in fact missed this entire discussion because I had `systemd' in
my killfile from the relentless advocacy flamewars ~4-5 years ago.
As Matthew Vernon writes, some of us have been working to fix these
problems but we are indeed somewhat hampered by a lack of effort.
Also we are hampered by the lack of a safe space to communicate and
coordinate.  I looked at some of the technical work done in other
distros to try to make desktoppy stuff continue to work well, and it
generally seems sane.  But some of those projects are quite toxic here
in Debian, as can be seen from some of the messages here.
We are setting up a separate mailing list on my server where we hope
to do the work without having to deal with people who don't see the
point or who have problems with some of the contributors.
There'll be another mail shortly with details of the list.
Ian.
