Shipping a systemd unit without a corresponding init script with the
same name is forbidden by policy:

In practice this is ignored.
Note that this also forbids, for example, ssh.socket/ssh@.service or
tor@.service which all don't have a corresponding init script of the
same name.  Also cases where the init script starts multiple services,
but there are individual units for each service in systemd is
forbidden.
I think this requirement isn't a good idea these days for various
reasons and will file a bug asking to drop it.
