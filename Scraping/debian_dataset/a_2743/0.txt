To my eye, this resembles the situation I see with Websites and JavaScript.
My position is that any Webpage which does not inherently need to be
dynamic (as only a tiny fraction of them do) should have a fallback to
work "well enough" in an environment which lacks JavaScript.
Importantly, "well enough" does *not* mean "just as well".
One example I give of the difference is that once upon a time, when I
visited an article on the Website of the Washington Post in Firefox with
NoScript, the page would render with multiple screens' worth of blank
space (except possibly for a generic left-hand sidebar) at the top,
before the actual page content - the article itself - at the bottom.
That was in no way working "just as well" as the with-JavaScript case,
but it did let me read the article, so it did qualify as working "well
enough".
In the same way, I would opine that a package does not need to work
"just as well" via the init script as via the systemd unit in order to
qualify as having sufficient sysvinit support, but it does need to work
"well enough" that way. That is, not all the fancy bells and whistles
that could be make the package more useful or easier to work with or
suchlike necessarily need to be included, but the basic functionality
should be present.
(And I say that as a near-diehard sysvinit user, who finds the idea of
sysvinit being dropped from Debian a source of considerable stress.)
