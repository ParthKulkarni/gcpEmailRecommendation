Given the flavor of sysvinit â€”an easily customizable boot processâ€” a missing
init script may be better than a "wrong" one.  An init script can be a
no-brainer blueprint using Petter's init-d-script.  A missing init script,
which forces each user to write their own ones, would spare the hassle to check
if there's any real improvement on each package upgrade.
So here's a real advantage of systemd.  Since users who prefer spoon-feeding
use the latter, sysvinit can afford to let its users install a daemon and take
the time to grasp how it works, e.g. reading the man page /before/ running it.
