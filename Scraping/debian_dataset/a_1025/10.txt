My understanding from reading a bit about this just now is that the short
version is "install ntpd if you want this to happen."
My impression is that ntpdate has been obsolete for years and upstream has
been slowly trying to kill it.  ntpd is the upstream-supported daemon, and
it periodically asks the kernel to set the hardware clock.  (And it
supports various command-line options to make it act like ntpdate if you
really want.)
The much simpler systemd-timesyncd doesn't set the hardware clock for
reasons that one may or may not agree with (I honestly haven't researched
it in any depth), but you can just run ntpd instead if you care.
Alternately, if you really want to use a clock setting mechanism that
doesn't ask the kernel to sync the hardware clock but you still want to
set the hardware clock, you can add your own shutdown init script / unit
to run hwclock --systohc (or even a cron job if you want).
