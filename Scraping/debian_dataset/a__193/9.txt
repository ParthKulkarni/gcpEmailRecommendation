1. Why are you setting up the chroot each time ?  You could keep it
set up.

2. I think you mean "the test grabs the real X" not that xvfb grabs
it.
3. Probably the actual difference is that when you run the tests in a
chroot, something launders your environment so that DISPLAY is not
set.  (Or maybe that your chroot tool is providing a separate AF_UNIX
display numbering space, so that a default of ":0" now goes to Xvfb.)
If I am right you can fix this problem by starting Xvfb in your main
session, and running the tests with the appropriate setting of
DISPLAY.
If this does not work then I think it is a bug in the tests, which
should honour DISPLAY.
