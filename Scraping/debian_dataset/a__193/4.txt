Is that actually true? Because xvfb should not interact with any
regular X sesssion that is running.
Could not the more likely thing be that while you start xvfb the
program you're trying to test uses your regular X session instead
of connecting to xvfb?
What is the value of the DISPLAY environment variable the program
is trying to use? Is that the virtual display created by Xvfb, or
is it the actual X session you're running on?
