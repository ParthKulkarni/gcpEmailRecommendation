Hello,

I did the installation once again and had got the same problem. I 
downloaded the iso from another location:
I took another USB-stick than before for installation. During 
installation this USB-stick was /dev/sdc and the debian system was 
/dev/sdb .
I selected /dev/sdb for grub install.
When rebooted grub came with this error message:
"error: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.
 Entering rescue mode...
 grub rescue> "
I solved the problem the same way as before.
Best regards
Rolf
