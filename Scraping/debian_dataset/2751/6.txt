I'm not sure I remember seeing anyone say that it did not meet the
definition of Depends - merely that it does meet the definition of
Recommends.

This does not actually seem to conflict with the "would be found
together in all but unusual installations" definition for Recommends; in
a case where the depending package can still provide meaningful
functionality without the depended-on package, but will miss "a
significant amount of functionality" if the latter package is not
present, both definitions would seem equally applicable.
If that's correct, then the definitions don't actually help indicate
which relationship should be declared in such a case. That strikes me as
a flaw in the definitions, quite possibly an unintended one, and (if so)
potentially a bug worth fixing.
