Bumping this as my mail to ftpmaster went unanswered.
Could someone please remind me who to ask about the NEW Queue?  It is causing
me a FTBFS as I need this Build-Depends for an existing package which itself
has reasonably wide-spread (for an R package) reverse dependencies.

Anyone who can help?  
The passive-aggressive "we won't work on your package, and won't tell you
why" is a wee bit annoying.
