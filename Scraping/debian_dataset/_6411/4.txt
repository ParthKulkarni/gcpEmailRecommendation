Automotive and mobile are quite different form factors. Also, I'd
expect that even if a car was running a Debian derivative or another
Linux distribution, it would be locked down (either technically or via
legal instruments) such that one could never gain control over the
system to install plain Debian. That said, packaging AGL or other
automotive components could be useful if we want to attract
manufacturers to basing their systems on Debian and sponsoring
DebConf. For end-users though, probably not so much.
