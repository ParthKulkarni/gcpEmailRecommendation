And probably the biggest reason _why_ you don't want to do this is
that tag deletion/replacement doesn't propagate via pull or remote
update. You can of course (with appropriate access) delete and
replace a tag on the remote but people who have already cloned from
it will never see that change (well, except for changes to
"lightweight" tags but those are really just a symlink to a ref and
not a typical tag object). Treating published tags as if they can't
be changed is far more friendly to other users of your repositories.
