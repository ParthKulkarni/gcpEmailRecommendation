Running a command from another package in postinst only requires a
normal Depends - not a Pre-Depends.
However, I don't think you need to run "udevadm control -R" at all. udev
will monitor rules from /lib/udev/rules.d while its running and
automatically reload them when changed.
For the second half of this bug:

This can be done by running "udevadm trigger". By default every device
on the system will be triggered which is a bit heavyweight, so you
probably want to add some *match parameters to restrict this to the
devices you're interested in (see the udevadm man page).
