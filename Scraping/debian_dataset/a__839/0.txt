Kernel hook scripts are run by the corresponding maintainer scripts of
kernel packages (in all package implementations I know of).  The
postinst hook scripts are also run by 'make install' if the target is
/.
The lilo hack using chattr to prevent kernel images moving around on
xfs seems like a policy violation to me, though I can't find an
explicit ban on modifying files belonging to other packages (other than
configuration files).  It is, at least, opt-in.
(But this hack isn't complete, because lilo doesn't make-immutable the
kernel images that were installed before lilo, or to undo this if it is
removed.  So far as I can see, that would make all kernel packages un-
removable!)
