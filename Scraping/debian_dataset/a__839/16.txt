I'm going to be more explicit here, but basically saying the same as
Helmut:
"sane system" == Priority: important (or higher)
Anything with Priority >= important will be part of any (bare) default
installation, as performed by debian-installer. (Also by a normal
debootstrap, without custom arguments explicitly requesting minbase.)
"Minimal system" (== Priority: required) != "sane system"
Please note how Essential: yes is not part of any of the above
definitions!
In a system like Debian, we want dependency tracking. A package
with Essential: yes prevents that. (It's explicitly forbidden in policy.)
Thus packages should not use Essential: yes unless they have a very
good reason for it (and sometimes that reason is that because of
historical Essential: yes usage it's VERY hard to get rid of it).
