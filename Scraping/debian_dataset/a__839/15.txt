+1.  I guess this is a good point for the MBF Helmut wants to do.
shlib dependencies are:
* lsattr, chattr, badblocks:
  ‚Ä¢ e2fslibs
  ‚Ä¢ libcomerr2
  ‚Ä¢ libblkid1
  ‚Ä¢ libuuid1
* filefrag
  ‚Ä¢ libblkid1
  ‚Ä¢ libuuid1
Of these, libblkid1 and libuuid1 are transitively essential; libcomerr2
(87.0 kB inst) is very popular: no rdeps above priority:standard but you'll
have a hard time finding an useful system without one of those rdeps;
this leaves e2fslibs (466 kB inst) whose other users are mc and a handful
of less-used packages.
Current e2fsprogs is 1340 kB inst + libss2 (99.3 kB inst).
On the other hand, looking at unstable-capable physical machines I own or
admin, despite none of them using ext4 for actual system or data, every
single one has ext4 for u-boot, /boot or often sees SD cards from some SoC,
thus I personally would benefit only on containers.
