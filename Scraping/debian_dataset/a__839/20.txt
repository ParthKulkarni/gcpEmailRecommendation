Doing such changes twice would be a huge waste of time.  As it's not such a
time-pressing issue, why won't we do it right from the start?
But, we're discussing changes to e2fsprogs behind its maintainer's back.  I
believe he reads debian-devel, but, being nowhere like a frequent poster,
apparently doesn't watch new threads immediately as they appear (and this
one started as a response to a 2011 post).
Ted: could you please chime in?  In case you unsubscribed d-devel, it starts
at https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/09/msg00449.html
TL;DR: Helmut wants to make e2fsprogs non-essential, he has a plan to make
dependencies explicit, but one identified issue is that lsattr, chattr, and
less importantly badblocks, filefrag are useful on filesystems other than
ext*, thus it might be good to have them moved out of e2fsprogs.
Meow!
