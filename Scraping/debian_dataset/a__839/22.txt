For an example of a package (where I recently added e2fsprogs
dependency) that currently triggers this lintian warning, see udisks2.

I disagree.
I don't see any practical problem with dropping it since the Priority
field will still have it as part of any (normal) installation. Potentially
something with a Conflicts/Breaks could motivate apt into attempting
uninstalling it during upgrades, but I don't see anyone having reported
such an issue so no need to assume the worst yet.
If people really think the theoretical is so important a stop-gap
solution could be to use (XB-)Important: yes. Maybe it should even
be used permanently.
See the (new) fdisk package (src:util-linux) as an example.

Famous last words. ;)
Thanks again for enduring through to the final end.

Andreas Henriksson
PS. I'd personally see it natural for e2fsprogs to be
Priority: important and (XB-)Important: yes. ie. Part of a normal (but
not minbase) install, plus safety guarded against deinstallation.
