Just in case this has been overlooked, there is already some effort
ongoing on the naviserver packaging.Â 
I filed an ITP[1] some time ago, and recently asked formally for a
first upload of the package and permissions over it (i am a DM)[2].
Volunteers to do it are of course welcome :)
As the openacs maintainer, which is also dependant on
aolserver4/naviserver, i would prefer to avoid maintaining different
configurations for both, so i am in favor of just replacing the
aolserver4 package with the new naviserver one, taking into account
possible transition issues.
