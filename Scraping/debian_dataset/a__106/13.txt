Hello,
I can see the argument for not asking to select a mirror when
there is a well-working mechanism for automatically choosing a
"near" (in networking terms) mirror.  Does deb.debian.org fulfill
everybody's needs in this regard?  ISTR that there were some
discussions in the past that deb.debian.org didn't resolve to
particularly useful mirrors for some parts of the world, but I
have no idea whether that is still a problem.  My personal
experience with deb.debian.org hasn't been that great - instead
of redirecting me to the Debian mirror that is run by my local
ISP (and that is in d-i's mirrorlist), it redirects me to an AWS
instance hosted rather "far" away in networking terms.
Regarding hiding the proxy question: I'm not sure that it would
be a good decision to hide the proxy question by default.  Being
able to connect to the mirror directly doesn't mean that one
doesn't want to use a proxy, in particular when a package-proxy
like apt-cacher-ng is available in the local network.
Personally, I would prefer if the proxy question remains
at default debconf priority.
Regards,
Karsten
