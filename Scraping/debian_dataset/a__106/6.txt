Note that TLS is only supported by one of the two CDN providers behind
deb.debian.org (AWS) right now. So if we make TLS the default, we end up
behind dependent on that single sponsor, which doesn't seem to be a
great idea.

If only we could auto-select the right one automatically. I repeatedly
had to pin one of the two CDN providers (different ones on different
hosts) because the performance was inconsistent between them.
I pulled out my RT account to check for mirror-related problems (they
seem to be in a different queue I can't see) and found [0], so it looks
like there's now a third unannounced provider that is not in the
rotation (yet?). Unfortunately it seems to be TLS-less as well.
I also wonder if we actually have sensible escalation points to solve
problems for the users and the bandwidth to do so. That concern is
especially grave if we're going to auto-hide the question by default.
Defaulting is something that makes sense to me.
Kind regards
