I have a very different perception - It is so rare that i reboot
my notebook which travels with me all day that everytime i do
i have troubles remembering the 30+ character Luks passphrase.
I suspend/resume multiple times a day and thats my current uptime:
 07:49:26 up 22 days, 20:04,  4 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.05, 0.17
And thats a pretty standard Lenovo T420... I dont care about rebooting ...
And i havent had the issue that the switch of suspend to hibernate fails.
