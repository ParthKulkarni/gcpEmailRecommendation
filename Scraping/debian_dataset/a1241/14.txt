Not AFAIK. I would guess that needrestart would need to be promoted to
standard priority and needrestart-session would need to be added to
tasksel's task-desktop package, or to each of the task-*-desktop
packages; this adds wxWidgets to the default install though. The
latter would allow different desktops to add different
implementations, for example if someone wrote a GNOME Shell extension
to highlight windows of applications that need restarting.
One important downside of needrestart/needrestart-session/systemd is
that it can't automatically restart systemd user services and root
systemctl can't restart user services, even via su/sudo and
needrestart-session doesn't restart them AFAIK. I guess this should be
fixed by needrestart-session doing restarts (or stops for
RefuseManualStart=true) of user services when requested to start via
the dbus call, plus adding a restart/stop button for processes
corresponding to user services.
Another downside of needrestart is that a lot of stuff doesn't support
being restarted sanely, like dbus, display managers, networking stuff,
/etc/rc.local, etc. There is a blacklist for that but it doesn't yet
include rc.local (#852864):
