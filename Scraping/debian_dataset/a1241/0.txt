The current limitation is in the toolkits. X11 is quite able to
advertise different DPI per output through XSETTINGS. GTK is able to
grab Xft/DPI and use it for scaling (even for non-font stuff, though it
will prefer to use Gdk/UnscaledDPI if available). GTK will watch the
value and update the application if it changes. Applications can also
subscribe to notifications for this value.
While XSETTINGS can handle several screens, GTK only tracks one settings
window and doesn't handle applications switching from one screen to
another.
Also, Ubuntu is now defaulting to Mir and the story doesn't seem better
here since people are still requesting a better HiDPI support. I suppose
that if support was implemented for Mir, it should be possible to make
it work with X11 as well.
