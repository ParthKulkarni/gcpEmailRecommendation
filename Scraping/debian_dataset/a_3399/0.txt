Thank you for moving this forward!

Right.  In the meantime, you can test using libpam-elogind-compat which is
a hack that Provides: a real package.  This lacks the opt-in effect, but
outside of packaging metadata should work the same.

Not sure if it's worth noting that the Provides must, and Depends can, be
versioned.  This allows requiring a certain level of the API.
