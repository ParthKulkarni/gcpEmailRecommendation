I would not include debian-science to the blends listed in the
installer: it is more an umbrella to organize the packages then a useful
selection of software. The software selection is also inconsitent: it
only contains software that is not maintained by a more specialized
blend (like debichem).
So, there is probably no real use case to install Debian Science in its
current form (unless someone takes the work to kurate a "Generic Debian
Science Workstation" or so).
On our last attempt, we had an opt-in for the blends to be in the
installer; I would propose the same now as well.
