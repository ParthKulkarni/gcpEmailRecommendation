Package: grub-installer
Severity: important
Hi,
If records/recollection are correct, we've been prompting for the boot
device to install grub on since this upload:
| grub-installer (1.86) unstable; urgency=low
| 
|   [ Vincent McIntyre ]
|   * Support menu selection of GRUB boot disk. Closes: #706112

One of the reasons was that there seemed to be no reliable way to detect
what device we've booted the installer from, and we've had issues with
wiping the d-i installation images for several years before that upload.
Proposal: restore the old device detection, and blacklist anything that
seems to be holding a Debian Installer image. Beware: we don't want to
trigger the same side effects as os-prober did (see os-prober uploads
between 1.72 and 1.75). One way to avoid the read-only mounting could be
to ensure a given token is present in a certain location of Debian
installation images.
Feedback welcome!
KiBi.
