Looks like you were talking about these bugs:

I note that naively adding "set -e" can make shell scripts more
brittle, especially when using diff or other commands that can return
failure in unforeseen circumstances. When doing the MBF, please remind
people to read their scripts, note the range of exit codes for each
command and add "|| true" for commands that return failure exit codes
that do not indicate failures or indicate conditions that should not
terminate the maintainer script.
PS: will you be packaging the software produced by the CoLiS project?
PPS: the lintshell link on the CoLiS website requires a login.
