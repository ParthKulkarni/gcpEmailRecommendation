Hello,
I am working on fixing bug #905178 which is caused by moving away from using ucf
to manage /etc/default/apt-cacher back to handling it as a standard dpkg
conffile.
I have a working solution which avoids unnecessary prompting. This is to remove
the ucf version of the file in the preinst unless it is modified. dpkg then
installs the new version without prompting.
Can I check that this is the correct way to address it, or should I take an
alternative approach?
Many thanks.
Mark
