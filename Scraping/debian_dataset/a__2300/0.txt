Hello,
many thanks for tracking this down to the watchdog driver.  We
had experienced the effect that rebooting from within d-i didn't
work properly on several sunxi-based systems, but hadn't found
the actual cause yet.  I've tried to do a bit of further research
and it looks like sunxi-based platforms are somewhat special in
requiring the watchdog even for the normal system reset
functionality and not only for an actual watchdog function.
I haven't found indicators for similar dependencies on other
platforms during my search, but of course they might exist
nonetheless.
Ben, do you know of any other platforms that require a watchdog
driver for a "normal" system reset?
If sunxi is the sole "odd" platform here, I suppose the best
solution would be to integrate the sunxi_wdt module directly into
the kernel-image-<version>-armmp-di udeb.  Probably we will need
to include it for arm64 as well, as AFAIK the 64bit Allwinner
SoCs A64 and H5 use the same watchdog logic as the older 32bit
SoCs.  Proper support for A64 and H5 will be available in kernel
4.13, so those will become target platforms for d-i in the nearer
future.
Regards,
Karsten
