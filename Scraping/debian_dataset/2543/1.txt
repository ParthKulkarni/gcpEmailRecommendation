RFA sounds appropriate for that, and you can also state in the RFA bug 
that anyone intending to adopt it should contact you first.
This being SGML the most likely result would be noone adopting it,
and you could then retitle the WNPP bugs to O later.
How many packages do actually use sgml-data?
translate-docformat depends on it, but I'd assume/hope most actual users 
no longer use SGML.
docbook-xml (sic) depends on sgml-data and sgml-base.
All this gives sgml-base impressive popcon numbers, but the actual usage 
is likely pretty limited. I'm sure we have users who still need tooling 
for SGML, but all this is now more a fringe area of the archive.

Someone took care of that, the list was migrated and is still reachable:
