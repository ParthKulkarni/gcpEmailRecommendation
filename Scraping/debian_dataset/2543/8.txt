Right, he was him who started the migration.

TBH, I never subscribed to that ML, as for some reason it wasn't used
(if you check the archive, it's pretty much all spam in the last years).
Indeed, at this point it would make a ton of sense to change all the
packages to just use that ML, given that we have it.
What do you think?  Should we ask all the people that are in CC here to
subscribe that ML and change the packages?
> Is team+foo@tracker.d.o address usable now?  Any howto to set it up?
It is.  I just created one, just for the sake of it:
https://tracker.debian.org/teams/xml-sgml/
That would mean the team address would be team+xml-sgml@tracker.d.o (it
can be changed, but it would also change the url).  IMHO, we should just
use the @lists.d.o one that provides an archive and everything.

Yes.

Not really.  And what you did is also fine for me (and quite
transparent).
