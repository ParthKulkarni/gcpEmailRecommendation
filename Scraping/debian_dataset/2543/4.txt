You missed my point.  I don't care about popcon.  Problem is "Reverse
Build-depends in main".  Try:
---
 $ build-rdeps sgml-data
 ....
Found a total of 1336 reverse build-depend(s) for sgml-data.

This is the concern.  I was wondering to place this package into simple Orphan
state or assigning to a group ML address which seems to have almost no reader.
This is what I was wondering.
FYI: I have been lontime subscriber of debian-sgml@lists.debian.org.
