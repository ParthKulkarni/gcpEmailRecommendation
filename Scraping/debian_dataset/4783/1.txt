Uh, what?
You do realize that the CA cartel model is security theatre, intentionally
subverted to provide so-called "responsible encryption"?  To break it, you
need to either:
* control _any_ of thousands of CAs (not merely roots), many of which have
  already been caught issuing MITM certs or are otherwise well-known to be
  conducting massive scale MITM by other means.  Some of those were papered
  over as "it was just a honest error, we swear!", some led to removal from
  ca-certificates -- all while multiple other CAs controlled by the same
  government are still there.
* get hold of a SSL private key.  Unlike gpg which can be done offline, SSL
  keys must be available on every front-end server all the time.
Thus, having a trust anchor provided in the Debian archive would be a
massive improvement.
Meow!
