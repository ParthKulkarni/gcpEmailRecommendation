Indeed it does. However, virt-manager also insists on
automatically starting the VM, and I usually also change
something in their settings _before_ the installation,
so I canâ€™t use that feature. (It does offer changing some
settings before initially starting the VM, but that doesnâ€™t
have the final configuration, and is *extremely* laggy up
to unusable if libvirt runs on a different system than
virt-manager.) Butâ€¦
