So you decide to annoy all the subscribers to two lists that have
nothing to do with your problem?
NEW takes time.  Always has, always will.  If your package hasn't made
it out of NEW, then don't upload other packages that depend on it.
Spend your time on something else.
It will eventually get processed.  There's nothing passive aggressive
about what's happening.  It's just how things work when you have
volunteers doing stuff that requires a chunk of dedicated time to focus.
