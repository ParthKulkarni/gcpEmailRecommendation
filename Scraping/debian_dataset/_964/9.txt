Checking the file now and ... he _is_ in the debian/copyright:

Again, if _we_ (as packagers) could see the output of your linters then you
and would possiblt not need three emails back and forth.

I actually meant that as a non-snarky and sincere question -- the page at
https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html is fantastic and very helpful.  But it
is missing a contact address. Or a hint of who to talk to.  I really do think
you (or ftpmaster) need to add _something_ there.
Thanks _again_ for getting me out of a NEW pickle.  New packages will follow
today. 
Best, Dirk
