This isn't about upstream ownership of software, this is about salvaging the
Debian package specifically, where the package has been neglected for a long
time and whose maintainer isn't responsive to bug reports or email contact, and
allowing for a process for another maintainer to fix up the package.  Without
some standard process for forward progress, the package remains in a broken
state and there are a lot of situations in which NMUs (Non-Maintainer Uploads)
aren't appropriate.
I've been in the situation of relying on software in Debian that was broken, and
before this process there wasn't a known path of how to deal with that.  Matter
of fact that's how I started getting into Debian development in the first place.
 It is unfortunately not uncommon to find a package [un|under]maintained such
that the pacakge in Debian needs salvaging.
I hope this helps clarify.
