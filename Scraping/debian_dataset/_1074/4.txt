Indeed!
Thanks for picking up this topic.

I won't be there, so just some quick thoughts in advance:

I think that's maybe a bit too complicated.
It all makese sense somehow in itself (and I guess I was involved in
coming up with these conditions some years ago) but reading it I have
the impression that I'll never remember it and will have to very
carefully and concentrated re-read it in every case where I might
want to salvage a package and hope that I get the result of several
ANDs and ORs right.

This looks good in general.

Totally minor point: Why the nmudiff?
Another thing that came to my mind is:
The proposal talks (also in the last quoted paragraph) about
"replacing the former maintainers"; what I in practice would like to
do usually is to move a package which is under-maintained and has a
single individuum in Maintainer to a team, with or without keeping
this person in Uploaders. (I've also seen cases where the person is
already a member of the team but maintains (or neglects) packages
outside.)
Maybe this is not relevant as it's covered by "changing the Maintainer
field"; or maybe it is because it allows the future ex-maintainer to
still work on the package, together with others in a team? Or maybe
I'm just making things more complicated when I was asking for simpler
guidelines before :)
 
Thanks again for working on this, and a successful BoF in some hours!
Cheers,
gregor

Semi-radical proposal
---------------------
"Salvaging a Package, the simple version"
If a package is apparently un(der)-maintained (e.g. RC bugs without
reply, several NMUs in a row, etc.) it can be salvaged, i.e. the
maintainership transfered to another person or team.
An ITS (Intent to Salvage) bug is raised against the package stating
the intent. If the bug is closed by the maintainer or an uploader,
the process is finished.
Otherwise, after 1 month, the package can be taken over by a new
maintainer person or team.
= Less radical variant =
If a package, which falls into the area of competence of a packaging
team, is apparently un(der)-maintained (e.g. RC bugs without
reply, several NMUs in a row, etc.) it can be salvaged, i.e. the
maintainership transfered to the respective team.
An ITS (Intent to Salvage) bug is raised against the package stating
the intent. If the bug is closed by the maintainer or an uploader,
the process is finished.
Otherwise, after 1 month, the package can be taken over by the team;
the previous maintainer is kept in Uploaders and invited to join the
team and help in the maintenance of the package.

Q: What is the worst that could happen if there was no package
ownership in Debian?
