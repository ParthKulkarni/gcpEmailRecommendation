So a maintainer misses one email and anything goes?  
I have packages that look somewhat unmaintained that aren't.  I may seem somewhat oversensitive on this, but I recently discovered a 'maybe we should remove this package' bug on one of my packages that I'd missed the mail when it came in.
TC is also supposed to set technical policy (including "contents of ... developers' reference materials").  I agree that invoking the TC for each salvaging decision is heavyweight, likely excessively so, but that isn't what I am suggesting.  I'm suggesting that they review and approve the salvaging POLICY (once and done, assuming they approve).
