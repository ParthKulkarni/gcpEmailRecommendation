Your options are:
Manually build libgdamm/etc and install them in ~/ or /opt or /usr/local
Talk to the jhbuild folks about getting libgdamm/etc into that.
Talk to the libgdamm/etc folks about adding it to the GNOME runtime.
Package libgdamm/etc in .deb form and get them into Debian experimental:

Personally, I would choose just the last one or possibly all of the last three.
