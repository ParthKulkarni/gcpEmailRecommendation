This issue is reproducible if the installer is starting in UEFI mode
(grub says "Debian GNU/Linux UEFI Installer menu") but CSM Support is
disabled in the Thinkpad Setup screen, which is the one you access by
pressing F1 at boot.
Set CSM Support to "Yes" under Startup -> UEFI/Legacy Boot to get past
this.
Alternatively, set "UEFI/Legacy Boot" to "Legacy Only", in which case
the installer will start in BIOS mode.

This might be due to the live image including i915.ko in its initrd? It
seems to get loaded pretty early on, much earlier than X. To
doublecheck, remove boot=live from the kernel parameters. You'll be
dropped into a initramfs shell and by running lsmod you'll see that i915
is loaded already.
Also I've tried booting the live image with modprobe.blacklist=i915 and
it behaves exactly like the installer with CSM Support disabled
(immediate blank screen).
