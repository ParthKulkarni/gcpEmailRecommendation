It happens every so often.
The archive software looks at the Distribution field of the .changes,
and doesn't care at all about what's in Changes (i.e. what's in
d/changelog).
Usually this is caused by using the -d option of sbuild.
dput maintainers: this is one check that is present in dput-ng and I
find a must-have.
cbmuser: install dput-ng? :P
