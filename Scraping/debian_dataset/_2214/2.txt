I replied to this thread.  I think there should be one release which is not
shipping /usr/bin/python before /usr/bin/python should be reused and pointed at
python (>> 2). This should be good enough to get all scripts actively converted
which are not part of the distribution.  If that release is buster, we should
require the use of python2 instead of python now, document that in policy and
provide a lintian check for that.
