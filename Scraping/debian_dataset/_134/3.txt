"a single bug, with inflated severity", the maintainer did not agree
with the severity. Inaction means, its severity is not accepted, is what
I understood. If there is an RC bug, you either fix it soon or accept
patches when someone fixes it.

Well, I first tried, the BTS, which they should be reading, then I
posted in their IRC channel, which did not receive any response, then I
try to join their alioth team, which was not accepted. I think I made
reasonable efforts to reach out to them directly.
