Hi Cyril,
Fine, but busybox will eventually be upgraded to a newer stable version
at some point, or it will suffer from old/buggy version with potential
security holes
if not, it means that on the long run it will be very difficult to
cherry-pick those security patches and the project wil not benefit from
new features and improvements
as for bug #854924, don't you think it would have never occured if a
newer version of busybox were installed? (after 1.23 at least)
