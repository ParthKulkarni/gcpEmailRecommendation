Well, either you want old stable or bleeding edge. And with web technologies it‚Äôs usually the bleeding edge type of people. It would take a full time job to create all the variants, and I do this mostly in my free time.
As for reproducible builds - that‚Äôs the next thing on my list, it seems that the patches got mixed up and the reproducible build patch got replaced with something else.
Cheers,
Ondrej
