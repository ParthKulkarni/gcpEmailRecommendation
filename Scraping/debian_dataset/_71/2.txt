I don't know if it's the correct place but I have some issues about this.
- I have not be able to set up directly a gitlab-ci.yaml directly in a debian
directory. If I define it as the document says, I cannot activate the CI.
However if I activate first in the root directory then I can activate the
pipeline and after I can move it to the debian directory.
- I can only make CI with the master branch (or I don't know how to do it in
other branches). How can I activate it in other branches differents than master?
- Can I set a CI yaml file different by branch? one for unstable, one for
stable, etc?
In any case, thanks for the work done. It's really good.
Leopold
