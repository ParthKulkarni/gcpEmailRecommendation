It's a bit unhelpful though that you didn't provide that information. 
You seem to indicate that you need to use IPv4 to access the nameserver? 
Is the real failure you report that it did not configure IPv4 correctly? 
I.e. didn't show a prompt and continued without it? Is a DHCPv4 server 
on the network where you tried this? Because the DHCP client seems to be 
unable to acquire an address. Does an IPv6 nameserver work? (Assuming 
your 6to4 connectivity actually works.)
Also it'd be helpful to see "ip -6 route" and "ip route".
