The HPC community does not want to need root privileges to get their
software installed/used on the HPC setup. This excludes regular
Debian packages, traditional containers like Docker and chroot environments.
If flatpak is an answer - great. But from what I get, there is no automated
transformation from .deb to it, so we would need to decide for packaging
in that different format instead of our regular effort. And then, to me,
flatpak
presents itself much like a regular container, so I do not see an
advantage over
Singularity. But I have no practical experience with it, just correct me
if I am wrong.
