I'm afraid I cannot give my support to this. I'm not involved with
release management, so this is just one rando developer's opinion.

Possibly it should. Looking at
https://sources.debian.net/src/diaspora-installer/0.6.3.0%2Bdebian4/diaspora-download.sh/
If I read that code correctly, it downloads code from github, and
installs it. There is no verification step that the downloaded content
is valid and hasn't been substituted by an attacker. This seems to me
unfit for a Debian stable release. I would expect the package to check
the checksum of the downloaded tarball, or similar mechanism.
