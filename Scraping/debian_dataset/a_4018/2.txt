I don't see any reference to sources.
Also I see it as "Ubuntu" and "Arch" as OSes, whereas I'd rather see the
status of the underlying driver so I can easily extrapolate from it to
what will happen in any particular GNU/Linux distribution.
The database describes itself as "an online tool for developers that
want to check out GPU hardware capabilites", so it seems to be focused
on hardware, whereas I think we need something that focuses on
the drivers.
