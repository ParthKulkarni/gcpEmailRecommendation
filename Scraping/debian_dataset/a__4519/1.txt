Hi,
I've been looking at using the "Built-Using" tag for dh-fortran-mod.
dh-fortran-mod is a debhelper extension for handling Fortran "mod" files 
(based on an original idea from Sebastian Villemont).
These mod files are effectively pre-compiled header files, in C/C++ 
terms; normally stored in /usr/include, or something like it. I've been 
adding  a new Fortran compiler ("flang", based on LLVM) which is in the 
NEW queue which is part of the driver for this. The trouble is that 
"mod" files are compiler-specific, and even version of 
compiler-specific. So when we moved from gfortran-7 to gfortran-8, the 
'mod' files were incompatible and needed to be rebuilt. Similarly, 
flangs mod files are incompatible.
(1)Adds a dependency / track on which compiler was used, to enable 
tracking for transitions.
(2) Puts the mod files in $fmoddir  where the compiler will get them, 
allowing co-installation of incompatible files.
(e.g. $fmoddir = /usr/lib/$multiarch/fortran/$fortran-mod-version, by 
default).
(1) Is the issue today. My initial plan was to add eg. 'gfortran-mod-15' 
to ${misc:Depends}. The trouble is, this adds a compiler dependency to a 
package that is unnecessary - some packages have a Fortran interface 
that has marginal numbers of users; most use the C/C++ interfaces. So, 
plan B was to use Built-Using, as in:
The difficulty here is that Policy 7.8 requires that Built-Using: is 
only used for source package tracking. This is then enforced on the 
upload package checking which rejects such packages (because gfortran-8 
is not a source package; gcc-8 is the source package, but this mostly 
misses the point).
So, can Built-Using: be safely extended to use this case, and the 
package checking relaxed ?
best regards
Alastair
