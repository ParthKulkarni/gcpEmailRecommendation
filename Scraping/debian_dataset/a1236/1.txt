The rationale for keeping qt4 in the archive for me (same for gtk1,
gtk2, etc.) is so that people could continue to build or run
out-of-distro legacy software far into the future. It saddens me that I
could very likely run an arbitrary decade-old win32 program on a modern
Windows machine (although not win16 anymore!) but the rapid churn in
Linux land means we have no such similar story.
Case in point, nearly any of the old Loki software games/installers are
broken on modern systems without quite a bit of surgery (the bash 3->4
migration is the first major culprit, but there are others).
But as I said earlier I cannot contribute towards supporting this pipe
dream and what little time I have for Debian is better spent elsewhere.
