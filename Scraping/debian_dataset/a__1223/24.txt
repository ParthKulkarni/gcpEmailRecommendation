If we already know this is going to be major issue, why aren't we
doing the sensible thing and enable extensions by default instead of
disabling it and then having to explain again and again how to enable
it because the majority of our users will at least want to use an
adblocker?
And browsing the web without any extensions is probably a way bigger
privacy invasion than the phoning home the extension system does, so
disabling it by default seems to be just privacy theater to me.
(I.e. it's a inconvenient measure that gives a feeling that Debian
does something for privacy but in practice doesn't really do much to
achieve that, similar to security theater)
Kind regards,
