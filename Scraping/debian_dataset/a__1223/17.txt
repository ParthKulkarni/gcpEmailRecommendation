Seems like it's at least possible to install system-wide plugins:
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/external_extensions#preferences
Those instuctions cover chrome but seems easily adaptable to chromium.
The problem with any ad blocker is that it needs up to date block lists
and related data which is usually stored upstream and opens up a door
for phoning back home.
I'm taking a look at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock since it's gpl-3
and has proper releases (I would expect that a lot of chromium
extensions are a licensing nightmare).
You mention that this is going to be a huge deal for stretch users, and
I agree with you, but we're deep into freeze so these won't be able to
go into stretch, so what's going to be the best way to make these
available to Debian stable users?
