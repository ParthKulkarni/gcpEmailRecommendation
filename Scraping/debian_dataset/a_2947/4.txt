It is, but not fully automatically due to transitions not being handled
properly yet (working on it). I use my script on a more than daily basis
and if I have time, I email manually with more information (after
looking at the situation). If time is limited (e.g. too many new
regressions) or I really don't understand the situation I just have the
script email out.

tracker.debian.org does that and uses it to generate an RSS feed you
could subscribe to. I use that for a long time already.
