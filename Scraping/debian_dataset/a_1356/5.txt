Wow, it is very optimistic to describe the manpage skeleton in #794244
as `information'.  It's guesses by someone (me) who doesn't know
git-dpm.
Certainly that manpage skeleton ought to have some `--dpm' options
sprinkled over it.  And the `git merge -s ours' can be avoided
nowadays by passing dgit `--overwrite' (which does the check mentioned
there too).
I see from another bug that Nikolaus is trying this out.  Nikolaus:
please do ask for help if you get trouble, and I'll try to sort you
out.  Hopefully when you're done we can construct a useful and
mostly-true workflow guideline manpage!
Regards,
Ian.
