I'll have to bring this up one more time. I just read
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794244, and that
sounds (in "USING GIT-DPM WITH DGIT FOR THE FIRST TIME") as if I should
also stitch the existing dgit history into my git repository.
Is that information outdated, or should I still do that?
Thanks,
