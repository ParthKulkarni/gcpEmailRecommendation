This is the wrong assumption because if your hardware supports GLES,
then it also supports GL. It is only the proprietary
module/driver/firmware that exposes the GLES only. Take a look at all
the mesa drivers, they all support OpenGL and GLES.

The hardware that supports GLES also supports OpenGL because GLES is a
subset of OpenGL. I find it very hard to believe that the hardware
somehow performs differently, if anything, the difference probably
comes from the proprietary module/driver/firmware.

It is not an easy decision to make. I grant you that.

I find it hard to believe that Debian, as a universal operating
system, would sacrifice software and freedom because some 3rd party
software only supports GLES or that they implemented OpenGL poorly.
I do however understand that there is a time/effort trade off here. Qt
supports both already but only one or the other and currently not both
at the same time. My only question then becomes, what is going to
happen when support for Vulkan lands. Are we going to have the same
discussion? The work will eventually have to be done.
