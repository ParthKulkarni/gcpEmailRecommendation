We have a Rasberry Pi working as a desktop here at my house.  It's quite 
usable as long as you only try to do a few things at a time, but it's not by 
any means zippy.  I strongly suspect that moving back from GLES would move it 
from "reasonable for limited use" to "pointless".  Please don't do anything to 
make things even slower.
