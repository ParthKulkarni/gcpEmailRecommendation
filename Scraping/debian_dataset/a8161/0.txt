  Description     : debhelper tools for automated non-packaging
The dh-curl-sudo-bash package provides a build-system method for debhelper
that automates the non-packaging of programs for which the preferred form of
distribution is the sequence
    "curl http://example.com/setup.sh | sudo bash -"
dh-curl-sudo-bash causes debhelper to create a maintainer post-install script
that runs the above command on the target machine when the package is installed.
Running dpkg-reconfigure is therefore enough to upgrade the package too, thus
preventing problems with upgrades. The dh-curl-sudo-bash source package
Build-Depends on devscripts so that uscan can be embedded into the postinst to
find the correct URL for upgrades.
Example usage:
  debian/rules:
      %:
              dh $@ --buildsystem=curl_sudo_bash
  debian/curl_sudo_bash.watch:
      http://example.com/setup-(.*\..*).sh
For completeness, other shells can also be selected by exporting the variable
DH_CURL_SUDO_SHELL from debian/rules:
    export DH_CURL_SUDO_SHELL=mksh
A future extension to dh-curl-sudo-bash is planned that will permit any github
repository to be automatically (non-)packaged; the following version will
iterate over all github and gitlab repositories packaging everything available.
We anticipate that this will make all other Debian Developers redundant as
from now on the only thing that is now required to make high quality packages
for Debian is to include the relevant URL. This package also obsoletes the
previous apt-gentoo package.
