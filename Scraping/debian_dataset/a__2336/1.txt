rename 859458 Because of displays with very high dpi, not only the keyboard, but the font has to be configured early
thanks
Console packages have always configured the keyboard as early as 
possible in order to facilitate interaction during bad fsck.  They have 
never tried (at least in Debian) to configure the font.  But your 
argument is valid so I am renaming this bug accordingly.

I am considering this issue closed because there are already files like 
these in the package. :)  See the option
setupcon --setup-dir
which is supposed to be used by initrd builders.  At the moment Dracut 
uses this option, I don't know if there are other initrd builders in 
Debian which use it.
But even with Dracut, the font will not be configured by initrd because 
console-setup does not try to do this.  Which is unfortunate because 
earlier versions of console-setup included font configuration in initrd.
