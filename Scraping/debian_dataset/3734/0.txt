Hi all,
(please Cc)
it seems that msgfmt has problems when run in a C locale, because what
is produced is not utf8 parsable.
For calibre I need proper utf8 stuff, but I don't see a way to enforce
an utf8 locale during the build process. I can depend on locales etc,
but en_US.utf8 or C.utf8 seems not to be guaranteed to be available.
What is the proper way to deal with these kind of setups?

Thanks
Norbert
