dpkg-buildpackage and debian/rules are the standard interface to
building Debian packages, so there's very little point in mentioning
that specifically.
Also, build/README contains this:
| Recipe:
|  - Install the build-dependencies on the host system
|    (run dpkg-checkbuilddeps in the parent installer/ directory).
|  - Create your own sources.list.udeb.local, otherwise the build host's
|    sources.list is taken as a template for sources.list.udeb.
|  - Run "make" to get a list of available targets.
|  - Build an image using one of the build_ targets (build_netboot,
|    all_build, etc). You may want to set the USE_UDEBS_FROM variable,
|    documented below.
|  - Look in dest/ for the completed images.
and the documentation of USE_UDEBS_FROM points to debian/rules already.
Cheers,
