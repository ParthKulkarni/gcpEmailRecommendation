Hi, thanks for your help, see below regarding documentation.

I wanted to build a net installer that would load stable (actually jessie but 
I'll start with stable) but using a recent kernel.
Firstly I went to https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller#Development and 
https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/CheckOut
I checked out the dev version using Anonymous checkout instructions and was 
reading... "If you just want to build bootable images, see 
d-i/installer/build/README"
So I was reading that README and realised that I probably wanted to build from 
stable not the development version, so I followed the instructions in there 
starting with "apt-get source debian-installer", the rest you can see in my 
original message.
Now that I see Cyril's message it makes sense to use dpkg-buildpackage.Â  I don't 
build debian packages every day so I am not really familiar with all the normal 
tools/workflow of a debian developer.
Now I am reading https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Build, which my browser 
tells me I read before (maybe a while ago.)Â  I see that has the advice to use 
dpkg-buildpackage.
Probably a note about dpkg-buildpackage and/or debian/rules could go in 
build/README?
