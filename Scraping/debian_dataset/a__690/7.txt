Indeed that worked very well and resulted in a successful build, thank you.
My next steps:
* Follow https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2017/12/msg00375.html to build 
with a backports kernel.
* Make whatever changes necessary so the backport kernel is installed in the 
installed system as well as the installer.
If that works maybe set up a regular build and put that up on http for people to 
use.Â  I.e. stable/oldstable netboot with backport kernels.Â  I think there would 
be interest in that for people trying to get older versions on latest hardware, 
which is my use case.
