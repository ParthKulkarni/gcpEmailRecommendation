I think a lot of those appstream installs are from KDE and GNOME which
install plasma-discover and gnome-software by default.
But beignet-opencli-icd's appstream metadata is invalid.

When you fix this issue, it may take a day or so for Debian's
appstream generator to pick up the change and publish it. If there are
no issues, the issues page won't be live but
https://appstream.debian.org/sid/main/metainfo/beignet-opencl-icd.html will be.
Also, do you have a link for more information about what
beignet-opencl-icd does?
Thanks,
