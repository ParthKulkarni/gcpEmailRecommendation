Try glxgears and es2gears on few different platforms.  On a Pi 3b
glxgears runs at about 45 FPS, es2gears slightly lower.  On my Rock64
it's in the hundreds of FPS but that's Mali.  Look at omxplayer, full
screen HD video while the CPU idles (on a Pi).  The GPU is more
capable than the CPU.  You can do software-emulated OpenGL on
anything, the question is how efficient it is.

No, I won't  call it "climate change", do you have a "reality problem"? - AB1JX
