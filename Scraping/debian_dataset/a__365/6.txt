That's really, really out of what would be reasonable for a stable update.
We'd need backports to stretch of multiple compilers, plenty of libraries.
It would also break the entire XUL ecosystem.
At this point, it'd be probably better to look into one of forks that claim
security support, of those the only candidate is Waterfox: version >= that
of Firefox in stable, the project has been going for awhile.
Any of possible options, though, make me really sorry for anyone who
maintains a browser... :(
