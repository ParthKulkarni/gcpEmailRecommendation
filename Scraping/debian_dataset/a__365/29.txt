(Sidenote: I found that pkg-mozilla-maintainers Alioth maillist got archived 
and is inavailable now; that might have driven this discussion onto debian-
devel).
Firefox 60 ESR would indeed be largely different from 52 ESR; as Adam Borowski 
said, "We'd need backports to stretch of multiple compilers (I would 
specifically point out the compiler of Rust, 'rustc'), plenty of libraries. It 
would also break the entire XUL ecosystem."
However as a user, I found myself largely expecting 60 ESR into Stretch 
(regardless of what technology Debian might use). Switching to another Firefox 
fork would certainly break Debian's reputation or even drive more people onto 
Chromium ("yes, Chromium in Debian (stable) is following upstream version 
closely and why couldn't Debian follow Firefox or even follow Firefox ESR?"), 
which would be unacceptable.
My personal suggestion is some sort of joint efforts and a exception to push 
all reverse depdendencies back to Stretch before 52 ESR got EOL. If that 
breaks the whole XUL system, just remove 'em all in next point release. The 
time window is limited (Augest 21, 2018, according to [2]).
Besides, it would be great if current firefox maintainers (and Rust 
maintainers) could step up and speak out their thoughts.
