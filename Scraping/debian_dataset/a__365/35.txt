Is there a precedent for declaring a whole class of packages RC-buggy,
yet continuing to offer them in the unstable and experimental suites
(that it what we would need in order to make it easy for administrators
to create those debs: we'd need to be actively using the tooling
ourselves)?
In this case, I take it the point is that the special exception for
updating src:firefox-esr in stable justifies excluding packages that
effectively depend on specific versions of firefox-esr.
The only case I know of a package that will never migrate to testing,
but isn't RMed, is a single package, src:firefox.
It would also be good to know what the Release Team think of Moritz's
proposal, since they have authority over what goes into testing.
