There's also an inverse problem: a number of extensions haven't
gotten around to porting (or can't be ported) from XUL to
WebExtensions. Since support for "legacy" XUL-based extensions was
entirely dropped between 52 and 60, users who were relying on any of
them will cease to be able to do so and the corresponding packaged
versions of them likely need to be dropped from the archive.
