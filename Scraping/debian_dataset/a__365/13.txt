Agreed, that's a deficiency in our current process/tooling. 
It would be nice to move away from using RC bugs as testing blockers, 
but instead declare a source package as not suitable for stable (e.g. 
in some meta data on ftp-master or in whatever tooling involved) and 
then have a mechanism to yank all those packages out of testing once 
we've entered a freeze.
