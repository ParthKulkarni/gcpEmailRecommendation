Also, bugs cloed by dak rm are closed with a version of 1.2.3-1+rm (with
1.2.3-1 the version of the source removed, I believe the highest when
multiple versions of the same source were removed at the same time).  So
you query for bugs closed with a version containing '+rm'.
This is documented in devref.
DAK removal logs are usually more parsable, of course.  :)
