Well, if you run an _x_term, you can just as well use X forwarding or toss a
png/svg over.  On the other hand, mailing a graph or putting it in a commit
message will meet a variety of clients, many of them in a browser. 
Alternatively, you can place the image on some random web server, but that's
often tedious, and unlikely to stay 10 years from now.

The output is meant to be rendered in a proper $DEITY-fearing mail/usenet
client, a rightful text editor[1], less or git's built-in pager.  It's just
that _some_ heretics read their mail in a buggy GUI client or a web page,
view commit messages on github rather than locally, and so on.  And in case
their web browser is not elinks, we need to avoid bugs.
Meow!
