What kind of significant drain exactly?
AFAIK so far noone has stated that it would be safe to build stretch 
armhf security updates on arm64 hardware, so in the likely event of 
stretch LTS support for armhf DSA and hosters are already kinda 
committed to maintain some of the current (or comparable) armv7
builders in 2 different locations until mid-2022.
Non-LTS support for buster will also end in mid-2022,
so if buildds (and likely porterbox) are still required
for armhf then armel hw needs are already covered.
