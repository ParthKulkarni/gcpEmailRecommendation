Perhaps it would be a good idea to arrange that we at least
automatically distribute the source code to the image ?
If you frequently need to edit the build script at the last moment,
can the build script copy itself into its output ?  It wouldn't have
to be in the actual iso; it could live next to it on the mirrors.
Forgive me if we already do that.
