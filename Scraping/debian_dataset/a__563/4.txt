If you think it's worth fixing, you can volunteer yourself to fix it.
That would look something like:
"I'm interested in helping make sure that THINGY happens. Would
patches which helped do THINGY be acceptable in principle? If not, is
there an approach which would accomplish near-THINGY that would be?"
and then show that you're actually invested in THINGY and the underlying
project by participating.
Otherwise, you can just raise it as a wishlist bug, make the best case
you can for it in one message, and hope for the best.
