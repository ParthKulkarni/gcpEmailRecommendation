No, the MBR is generated from the isolinux/syslinux packages. xorriso
(libisofs) just updates some pointers in there to point at the El
Torito bootable images, to add a fake partition table, etc.

Sorry, wrong. It was built using the standard xorriso and libisofs
versions in stretch. From the stretch-based VM used to build it:
root@STRETCH-debian-live-builder:~# dpkg -s xorriso | grep Version
Version: 1.4.6-1+b1
root@STRETCH-debian-live-builder:~# dpkg -s libisofs6 | grep Version
Version: 1.4.6-1
If the PureOS folks are having problems, they could ask on the
debian-cd list?

Right, I'll give you that one. But there's *seriously* nothing special
there any more than what you'd find in any backport to jessie.

Go argue with the Policy folks, I guess.
But a *lot* of the infrastructure we use to run Debian is not exactly
what's been packaged, as already mentioned. Look at dak. debian-cd,
live-wrapper et al *are* packaged, but we're not *necessarily* using
the exact code that's in the stable archive at any point. We're
typically using code from git on the build machines, to allow for more
flexibility in terms of changes to build scripts as problems arise. We
release things to the archive periodically as a convenience to users,
but serious use often necessitates using git too. This isn't going to
change any time soon.
