I do not say you are doing it wrong.
I say we(!) can do better.  I can do better if I can repreat your work 
using Debian components.  I can more confidently verify that I did not 
mess things up if I can mimic with a higher degree your work.  When I am 
more confident in testing that my setup fails not because I am stupid 
but there is some likelihood that it is a more general problem, I am 
more likely to dare raise it as a bugreport.  Yes, I know that you 
welcome my asking on the mailinglist - but I know that I can have 
trouble explaining myself, so I can be shy.  I don't think I am alone.
I try argue that treating build tools used for producing Debian make 
sense to get packaged for Debian.  Could be after the fact.
I say your looking at services and build tools together and concluding 
the task is too big might change by looking at a smaller task.
This is not an attack on your work.
