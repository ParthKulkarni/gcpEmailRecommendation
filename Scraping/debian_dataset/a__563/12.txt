Personally, I think sniping about how people who are doing the work are doing it "wrong" by people who aren't is one of the most demotivating things that happens in Debian.

No one can volunteer to fix it until it's acknowledged this is worth
fixing. So far it's maintained that the current approach is the right
one and should not be changed "to pander to smb's ideals". This is
something I disagree with. I write that reproducibility of images is a
valuable property and if current processes don't ensure it, then it's
reasonable to improve these processes. Now, if we manage to agree on
that -- then yes, volunteers are welcome to implement the actual
change. At the moment they're clearly not.
