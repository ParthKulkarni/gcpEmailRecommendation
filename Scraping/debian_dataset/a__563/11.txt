Can you identify any code at all from libisofs which is embedded in
the images? I'm honestly not aware of any.
I've been using upstream versions of xorriso on-and-off over the last
few years, accepting assistance from the (very helpful!) upstream
author Thomas Schmitt when trying to debug thorny issues like hybrid
BIOS/UEFI booting.
The exact behaviour that we've worked out in some cases has needed
upstream tweaks, and we've needed those tweaks from time to time in
what we've released.

That would be a serious bug IMHO - please raise any as you find them.
