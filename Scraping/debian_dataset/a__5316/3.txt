I didn't think it was necessary. But having addressed the 4.1.3 prohibition of
AUTOSTART=0|1 in /etc/default/apt-cacher, that file was no longer being modified
in the postinst.  Therefore it *could* revert to being a normal conffile.
I suppose I thought simpler handling and dropping an unnecessary dependency was a
step forward.
But I am happy to be told I am wrong ;)
Thanks.
Mark
