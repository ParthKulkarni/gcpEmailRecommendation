Thanks for this description. I will try to write more description, but
its not very easy always especially when you are not allowed to write
sample code. When it is a single function, the user of that library is
usually a programmer that wants to use the function in their code, but
policy forbids writing sample code and some packages were rejected for
including the sample code (we started including sample code after
discussions about lack of good descriptions). When you are not allowed
to write 2 lines of sample code when that is the best possible
description to the target audience, its very irritating.
