1.5~alpha4 is available now including support for https://
proxies, CONNECT on http(s) proxies, fixing several bugs,
and switching the default https method over (the old one
is installed as curl{,+http,+https} if you install
apt-transport-https). apt now provides apt-transport-https
(versioned) so you can easily remove it even if you have
something depending on it.
Earlier today 1.5~alpha3 fixed a regression introduced
in 1.5~alpha2 (all downloads would fail, complaining about
not being able to read CaInfo - I forgot an 'else' before
the opening brace - sorry).
