when performing a test install with an d-i_buster_alpha3 image and setting
language to German, I see an entry 
	"Access software for a blind person using a braille display"
so that menu entry is not translated.
Which package is reponsible for this?
The l10nstats show 100% for level1, and I cannot find the above string in
the d-i repository (master po files for example).
CC'ing Samuel, which is likely to be the right person for this :-)
