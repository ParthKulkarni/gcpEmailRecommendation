Yeah, it is.  There is one problem, though -- even if you install the extra
docs,
  zgrep -i ubrl `dpkg -L imagemagick-6{.q16,-common,-doc}`
shows a wee bit too little for my taste.
The header on
https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/master/coders/braille.c
gives a hint why you're aware of this feature, but it isn't exactly
discoverable for the rest of us.  Could you please advertise it in the docs
somehow?
Your code is strictly more powerful than mine: you support 6-dot and
device-specific encodings -- my focus was on abuse by sighted people, I have
no access to actual Braille devices.
Thus, the image part is redundant, and has no reason to be packaged.
I wonder about the histogram tool.
