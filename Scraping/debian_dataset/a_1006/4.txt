That's not normal: fixed-width fonts should really have fixed-width for
the characters used by gnuplot.

That's expected: some characters have double-width, others have
zero-width. But for characters that have single-width, they are really
aligned with a proper fixed-width font.

Then gnuplot is missing taking into account the value returned by
wcwidth() (0, 1, 2, ...), that's the bug.
