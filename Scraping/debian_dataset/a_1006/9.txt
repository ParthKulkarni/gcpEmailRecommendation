"Should have" and "have" are different things. :(

My test sheet accounts for that: it includes only wcwidth()==1 and 2
characters (recently updated for unstable's glibc).  You can see that most
lines include 64 characters, CJK ones have 32, a few lines are mixed.

Depends on your software.  xterm, libvte, pterm, rxvt-unicode get it right,
mousepad, firefox, chromium and Microsoft Edge don't.  They prefer
appearance over accuracy, and when borrowing a glyph from another font, they
use the other font's horizontal advance which breaks the fixed width rule.

I don't know whether gnuplot is doing it correctly, I haven't tested -- but
even if it does, the output will be misrendered by browsers.
This is not restricted to Braille tricks, same happens if your label
includes letters that happen to not be in the recipient's chosen font, and
you can't control the latter.
Thus, the only safe way to use Braille for drawing is to not mix it with any
other character range at all -- or at most, place labels exclusively to the
right of a rectangular graph.  Even labels at the bottom turned out to be
badly shifted.
Meow!
