For most of these bug reports there exists a setting in which the
modules can be imported. E.g. a significant chunk of them becomes
importable after installing python3-pkg-resources.

In my initial mail there is a draft.gz that contains the proposed bug
reports. Searching for python3-dj-static yields:
| After installing python3-dj-static importing the module dj_static
| into a python interpreter fails with the following error:
| 
| Traceback (most recent call last):
|   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
|   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dj_static.py", line 5, in <module>
|     from django.conf import settings
| ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'
So my heuristic did select the right module and it failed to import,
because no dependency on python3-django was declared. Thus the bug
report seems legitimate to me.
