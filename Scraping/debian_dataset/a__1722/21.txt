Alternatively, use "apt-cache showsrc --no-all-versions" which will print the
candidate version. The candidate version is usually the highest version
available to apt. If you combine this approach with chdist, then you should not
run into false positives anymore.
Or, if you want to follow Adam's approach reading apt-avail, and only retain
the highest version of each package you can use botch-latest-version to do the
filtering.
Thanks!
