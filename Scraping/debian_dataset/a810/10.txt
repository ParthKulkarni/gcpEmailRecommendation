Is there some reason why this would be Hurd-specific? Is fakeroot's
emulation of real root significantly more limited on Hurd, or do the
Hurd buildds invoke builds differently, or something?
dbus fails build-time tests under fakeroot on all architectures
(or at least, I would expect it to, because it tests AF_UNIX
credentials-passing), which makes me wonder why this failure mode would
have manifested on Hurd and not Linux in the past. I would have expected
packages whose tests don't like fakeroot to either succeed equally
on both, or fail equally on both, if unrelated reasons for failure
are ignored.
