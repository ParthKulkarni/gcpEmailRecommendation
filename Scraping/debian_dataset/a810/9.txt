I think it makes sense to declare dpkg-buildpackage the official entry 
point. Reasons for:
1. It is already the de-facto entry point, since buildds use dpkg-
buildpackage, and so do pbuilder and sbuild.
2. Most (all?) of the archive already depends on dpkg-dev, by using the /
usr/share/dpkg/*.mk helpers (either directly or indirectly via CDBS) and 
using dpkg-* tools (either directly or indirectly via debhelper).
3. Providing a clean environment helps the reproducibility efforts, by 
providing a single place where many weird environment variables can be 
neutered. It probably will also help other archive-wide efforts
4. dpkg-buildpackage has the --target and --as-root flags to invoke any 
debian/rules target since 1.15 (oldoldstable has 1.16).
Reasons against:
1. Finger memory. This can be alleviated via a suitable alias 
drules='dpkg-buildpackage --target'.
I can't come up with other reasons.
Let's make dpkg-buildpackage the official entry point.
