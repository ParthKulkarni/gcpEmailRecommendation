The important bit isn't whether dpkg-buildpackage is the official entry
point, because that isn't what Policy cares about. Policy defines an
interface to be used by whatever build tool is used, and all conforming
packages implement this interface.
If a package doesn't build correctly without environment variables that
aren't part of the interface, then the package is buggy and needs to be
fixed.
If we want to extend the interface, then we need to change Policy. We
can just define that all the variables provided by dpkg-buildpackage are
part of the interface now (and I don't have a real problem with that),
but I'd rather not delegate the Policy definition of a source package to
the dpkg-buildpackage manpage, last but not least because we have
multiple versions of that manpage in different releases.
