Control: tags -1 - patch
I've no more desire to work on this bug, sorry.
Thanks for the feedback that was given, but it has already been more
effort than I have time or patience to contribute.
For what should be essentially, s/md5/sha256/ in a few places, the
required procedures and personal interactions beyond that, is just too
much.  That is the real "debacle";  it is not surprising to me now, that
this did not happen yet in 10 years, or that no enthusiastic new
contributor had already done this.
Regards,
