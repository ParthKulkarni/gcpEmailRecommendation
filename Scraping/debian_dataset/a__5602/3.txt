Does it also provide an init script?  Else, it's RC buggy according to
9.11 in Policy.

How do you ensure that those settings are kept in sync with any command

I don't think a small number of log users would be a particularly high
cost to bear.  You could also create those using triggers when runit is
installed.

I think
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/08/msg00001.html
should be sufficient here:
   For the record, the TC expects maintainers to continue to support the
   multiple available init systems in Debian.  That includes merging
   reasonable contributions, and not reverting existing support without
   a compelling reason.
