We generally try to avoid tiny packages in the archive; having 1000+
automatically generated source and binary packages in the archive seems
like a suboptimal solution.
Neither systemd, sysvinit or upstart required extra binary packages.

That would still result in many tiny binary packages.

Same.
As a possible alternative: ship the runscript and some metadata (which
systemd service(s) and/or sysvinit script(s) this corresponds with;
which system users would be needed; ...) either in the service package
(preferred long-term) or a "runscripts" package (maybe easier for
initial experiments).
Then have runit provide a command that creates the system users, sets up
the runit service and disables the systemd service (which I think was
still missing from the *-run packages).
