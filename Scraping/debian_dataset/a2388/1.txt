Hi,
According to my records main security support for Jessie can end any time
after 17th June. 
So to the security team: do you have a date in mind?
I also presume that LTS will take over the existing security suites as
before. [1] lists the current delta between security and o-p-u-new which
would ideally be as short as possible before the EOL date.
For everyone else, assuming it'll be soon after that date please
indicate your availability from:
 - 23rd Jun
 - (30th Jun I already know is impossible, for the sake of completeness)
 - 7th July
or adjacent Sundays.
