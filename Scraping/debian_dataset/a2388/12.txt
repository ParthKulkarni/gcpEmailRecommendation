It should be/seems to be. I've just pushed the required change to git
after a quick netboot build with (o)pu enabled; currently performing a
full build on amd64 just to be sure.
What would be an appropriate timetable from your point of view for the
relevant upload? Relatedly: are all changes expected for this final
point release in place already?
Cheers,
