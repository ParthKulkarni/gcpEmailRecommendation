Hi,
Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org> (2018-06-19):

Of course we won't have netinst until the point release has happened;
and I guess I didn't really mean netboot either since we're currently
lacking udebs for the new ABI (only in o-p-u for now), so I could only
test the installer boots fine, and that speech synthesis also starts
properly.
Very low on free time, so I'm really unsure I'll be able to play the
‚Äúhack the archive‚Äù game where I pretend to have merged oldstable and
o-p-u into something d-i can process; sorry‚Ä¶
Cheers,
