Dominique, thank you, that was a nice find. I'm looking both new and
old innovations which might be credited to Debian, both in technical
terms or in social terms. I would discuss about lcdproc in another
e-mail altogether which I just did. I do have loads of questions about
Debian history which perhaps might or might not be interesting to
people, I just fired the first one just a short while ago -
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/08/msg00597.html
While some of the queries might seem to be trivial there is lack of
authoritative answers to them.
@Andrey Rahmatullin  I read your answer at
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/08/msg00598.html but it
doesn't tell me whether this obvious idea was born in Debian or some
other GNU/Linux distribution. I do not the early history of Debian so
it is possible that at one point it was a single changelog.gz file and
then separation of the two changelogs happened along the road or
something like that.
If somebody knows something it would be nice to know. I had tried to
look if early packages could be found but sadly snapshot.debian.org
has records from 2k5 only, a simple
http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/?year=2000 reveals from when
the packages are available. The first Debian stable release was in
1996. https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-releases.en.html
It would be helpful if somebody has one of the 1996 packages snapshots
and can share how the changelogs were at that point of time. That
might give a bit of reference as to how things were and if there were
any changes between them and now.
Also the crucial question if whether this idea came in Debian first
and then flowed to other distributions or was it was first used in
Redhat and then came to Debian would be interesting in itself.
Hope I gave a bit more context from where I'm coming from.
