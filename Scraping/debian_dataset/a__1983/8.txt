Will give you glibc 5, from 1998, but the packaging is from 1999.  It
already had separate changelogs.

Sorry, I have no idea about that.  But it is such an obvious thing to do
once you have "distro versions" (which RedHat *already had*), that I'd
bet the dual changelogs came from whomever started with distro-specific
versioning first.
Take a look at early slackware, it is the oldest you can still find.
