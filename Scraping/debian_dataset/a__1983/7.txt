You know, you could have sent me an email if you wanted to have some
information on my work. You can have a look at my blog, I post monthly
summaries where I report the work I did on Debian and Kali.

There's also a section about the relationship with Kali in this book:
https://kali.training/chapter-1/relationship-with-debian/
https://kali.training/chapter-1/a-bit-of-history/
I also gave a talk last year in Debconf:
https://kali.training/chapter-1/a-bit-of-history/
I started the pkg-security team notably to help bring back Kali
packages into Debian and to make it easier to help maintain security
packages that we use in Kali and that come straight from Debian.

HTH.
