You can always involve more people but not including debian-boot@ is
wrong.

Well, my first paragraph didn't cover everything you wrote below, but
I did say we were aware of this, and that you may want to open a bug
report to track it. So feel free to do exactly that, instead of
dismissing it entirely.

My memory might be faulty but I fail to remember a single case where
this has been a source of issues. We have plenty of things on our plate
already, so sorry if we haven't been fixing issues with no real life
impacts.

This looks reasonable, and as I said, a few similar issues have been
fixed over the past few years.

Maybe look at its changelog, history, or talk to its maintainer. I'm not
kmod specialist.

Please make sure debian-boot@ gets a copy of all such bug reports (like
anything touching/affecting d-i in some way), and to get a green light
before ‚Äúkilling‚Äù anything.
Thanks already.
