Package: debian-installer
Severity: wishlist
We manitain a partial (i386 and amd64) local mirror 
of the debian repository. But the installer doesn't
provide an easy way to use it for installation.
I never do installs connected to the Internet.
It's not that big of a deal, since everything can 
be taken care of after the install. But every
time I perform an install I always think it would
be a nice thing to have.
So, I wish the list of mirrors included 
'custom' where the user can input an apt-source
style line for a mirror.
