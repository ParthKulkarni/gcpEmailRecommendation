To my mind, at least, the purpose of contrib and non-free is for
packages that can't be in main for DFSG reasons /alone/.  Social
Contract item 5:
    We acknowledge that some of our users require the use of works that
    do not conform to the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  We have
    created "contrib" and "non-free" areas in our archive for these
    works.

Okay, I see how this would be useful -- thanks for the explanation.
I am still very uneasy about serving our users -- even our users of
Debian unstable -- with packages that are built using material pulled
from the net.  I think that people who add 'contrib' to their
sources.list do not expect this kind of thing.
