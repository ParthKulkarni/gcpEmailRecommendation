I am completely with Sean here; I read the following messages, and am
happy a better resolution was found. But, FWIW, I'll support Sean's
interpretation - Contrib and non-free are *not* places where we can
happily breach any bits of policy; they are exclusively for things
that cannot be shipped in Debian Main due to their DFSG status.
And, yes, network access during a build... Is a clear no-go. Specially
if as a project we are committed to this so neat Reproducible Builds
thingy that has made so many among us proud to be part a project where
an ages-long problem is finally being tackled - And quite
successfully, even!
