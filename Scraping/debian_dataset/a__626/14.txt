So, what happens currently? Do the affected packages FTBFS? (that,
IMHO, would be a *good* thing, as we would only need to patch Policy
to reflect reality)

No. It does not only change the perception. You ship a pre-built
binary as part of your sources, then the build process (with, yes, a
piece of untrusted blob... But still, that's as far as we can get)
will happen across our buildds, or by whoever wants to NMU, or even by
yourself days or weeks later, with a piece of software known to yield
the package as it got built. We will not be bitten by a random site
being unexpectedly offline, or by a transpiler changing some
command-line options without notifying us (to mention only two
possible issues)

Yes. Reading through the thread, I see several people are still
directing their criticisms of this situation to your person. Lets try
to keep this separate from Praveen, and focus on the general
reasoning!
