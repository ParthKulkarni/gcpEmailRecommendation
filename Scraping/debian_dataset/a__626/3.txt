Ack. Wouldn't it be preferable to just include a copy of the prebuilt
node-d3-color "binary" alongside its actual source tarball and have
debian/rules just copy the prebuilt "binary" for now? That would
fulfill one of the widely accepted use cases for contrib (needs
something currently not in Debian to build, but is otherwise free
software - see e.g. the VirtualBox BIOS requiring a non-free
compiler) much closer than downloading stuff from the network.
I think that requiring network access during build is a big no-no in
general, regardless of where the software is sorted into. For
example it fails the dissident test. And it ensures that that what's
in the Debian source package is that what you actually get in the
end, not subject to the whim of server operators outside of Debian
during build time (which may be at any point as there are binNMUs).
