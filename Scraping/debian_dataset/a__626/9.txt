AIUI right now the packages are not being built on the buildds,
because they've been uploaded with the binaries (which are arch:all).
Anyway, Pirate says he's going to get rid of the downloading at build
so this is a non-issue for these packages.
I'm not sure what you think is wrong with policy.  Sean quoted the
statement forbidding network access during build.

These are all very good reasons, and including a prebuilt blob in the
source package(s) is clearly much better.  But I still think this is
not what contrib/sid is for.
