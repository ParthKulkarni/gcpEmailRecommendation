When working in a source directory named foo-1.2.3/, and then hitting C-c v in
debian/changelog, the mode smartly figures out the version number and creates
and appropriate new entry 1.2.3-1.
When working in a git repo where the directory is just foo/ this fails and
the changelog just increments the previous version.
Would anyone by chance have taught the Emacs debian-changelog submode to get
the version number from the git tags?
Please CC me on replies.
Thanks,  Dirk
