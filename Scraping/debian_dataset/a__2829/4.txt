The Emacs modes in bin:debian-el are badly in need of maintainance.
There are all sorts of problems, of which this is just one.
If someone is interested in doing this we would first want to break
bin:debian-el out of src:emacs-goodies-el and build bin:elpa-* packages
using dh_elpa.  Over the past few years we have been gradually breaking
packages out of emacs-goodies-el but progress has been slow.
