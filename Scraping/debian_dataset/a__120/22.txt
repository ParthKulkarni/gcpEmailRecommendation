I don't see any reason to make it hard, but it should definitely be shown
less prominently than the current stable release. And the difference in
the status must be clearly communicated.

LTS has been running for 4.5 years and rely on many sponsors so that nothing
stops when one sponsor goes away. It's not that fragile currently.

My experience has rather been the opposite. Most paid LTS contributors do
between 10 and 30 hours per month for LTS and in multiple cases it
allows them to spend many more hours of volunteer work in the project.
