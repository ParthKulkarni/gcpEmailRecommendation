I agree here, my suggestions below were just asking how could we make
things better or even more clear to the uneducated user, who comes from
these other projects, which have a different release/maintenance
process. I would refute some of the suggestions myself, but thought
about suggesting anyway because I didn't want to assume how other people
would feel about them.

I meant that we would say that stable is supported by the security team.
And instead of saying that Jessie was supported by the LTS team, we
would say supported by Freexian. The table at
https://wiki.debian.org/LTS doesn't even say "supported by LTS team",
but "supported by LTS", which might be confusing to these users. So,
maybe just fix this nitpick?

Ubuntu started supporting an EOL release with "Extended Security
Maintenance". So, maybe start using something like those two projects
have been doing?

Agreed. Advising new users that they should be using the latest stable
release if they have no explicit need to use any older ones.

Yeah, not true that Stretch would have a latest term support compared to
any earlier release. So, if one needs something that lasts 12 years,
should one be picking up Stretch, Jessie or Wheezy?

I am not trying to make them, just realized that some user confusion
might have come from that, and trying to share this, so we can think how
to make it less confusing to the users.
By the way, love the work you all have been doing, Debian rocks, Debian
LTS rocks, keep the good work!
