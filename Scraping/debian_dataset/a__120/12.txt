It does; they are distributing the latest (lastest) point release. As 
you already stipulated, this is no different than the normal state of 
stable, which is only secure if you update & upgrade with security

IMO, the main benefits of point releases are that 1) they reduce the 
amount you need to download if you are installing from an iso and 2) 
they are an opportunity to introduce *non* security updates into stable. 
I'm not sure that either of these are relevent in the context of this
