I agree that more than one consultancy should/could provide resources
for LTS.
I find it inappropriate that that we (Debian) publicize solicitation of
donations to Freexian on debian.org websites [1] and, further, that we
the advertise their 'Extended LTS' commercial offering [2].

Nor am I, but I do not find the lack of distinction between Debian and
Freexian to be appropriate.
One way is for the funding for Debian LTS to flow through Debian's
Trusted Organizations, complete with the restrictions that might come
with that.
Another way is for Debian websites to not solicit for donations or to
advertise for their commercial offering (my preference).
