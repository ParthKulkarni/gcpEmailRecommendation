Debian has long maintained references to consultants (like the paid LTS
work) and commercial derivatives (like the ELTS) and I don't think
that's inherently problematic.
But the wording here could certainly be improved to make it clearer
that Debian has no special relationship with Freexian.

Debian can't afford to pay developers in general, and previous
proposals to pay specific developers were not well received.  So, I
don't this happening.
