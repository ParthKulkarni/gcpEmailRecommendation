I am guessing one of the other (incorrect) assumption users might make
is that the "LTS version" is preferred over other versions. That's how
LTS works for Linux and Ubuntu, for example. So, a user would rather
install Ubuntu 18.04 that is supported for 5 years than Ubuntu 18.10,
that is supported for 9 months. The same happens with Linux 4.14 versus
Linux 4.18.
I am not sure it's clear to users that all Debian stable versions would
have Long Term Support, because the releases are not *labeled* as LTS. I
know the wiki says:
"Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of
*all* Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years." (emphasis mine)
But I believe the table right below that would still confuse some users
that would understand that Jessie is supported by LTS, while Stretch is
not, even though there is a schedule column there.
Using the LTS term in a slightly different way than the "industry
standard" now means we need to spend a little more effort on users
education.
Should we:
1) Start calling the stable releases as LTS releases?
2) Say "supported by Security team" versus "supported by Freexian",
instead of just saying "supported by LTS"?
3) Stop using LTS as a "label" for oldstable releases?
4) Just advise users all the time that they should prefer the latest
stable release, as that is going to have the "latest term support"?
5) Is that not true anymore with Extended LTS and CIP?
