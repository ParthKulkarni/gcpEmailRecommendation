Unfortunately, I don't think this suggestion could help with the issues
raised by Steve.
The more LTS is integrated with the regular project, the more that teams
will feel they have to spend time on LTS matters.  Even if paid LTS team
members are the ones writing the patches to do the actual integration,
the relevant Debian team will still have to review those patches, engage
in design discussion and keep LTS needs in mind while doing their other
work.  Indeed, that's what you're asking for in the paragraphs of your
e-mail I've quoted.  Reducing integration avoids this problem.
