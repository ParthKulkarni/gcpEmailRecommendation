No problem here (french ISP Free).
I had this problem once, and it was because I had improperly configure
the MTU of my default route. It was configured as 1500 (default)
because I wanted to have a static ipv6 address and my connexion needs
it to be set as 1480. Compare the result of the following command
between SLAAC and manual configuration.
$ ip -6 route | grep default
default via fe80::1 dev br0  proto ra  metric 1024  expires 1714sec
mtu 1480 hoplimit 64
