Thanks.
I have read the bug logs and Trent Buck's message here
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694068#47
seems to suggest a way forward.
Perhaps someone would care to write and test a patch to d-i's network
configuration arrangements, to implement Trent's suggestion ?  I think
that the people who don't have network-manager would probably prefer
this to use ifupdown, and making a whole new udeb will be work, so
Trent's second suggestion seems sensible.

I have to say that the tone of this message is rather unfortunate.
You make it sound like someone is deliberately breaking stuff.  That
doesn't seem to be the case.
Comparing to other distros can be very helpful but generalised
statements that they don't have this bug is less useful than looking
into how they solve the problem.
