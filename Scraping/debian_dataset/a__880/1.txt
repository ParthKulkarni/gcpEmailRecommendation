I like the idea of improving the installer, or debian itself in any way.  
I'd hate to see the bug tracker turned into a discussion forum though.  
I think the idea needs to be talked over a little better, because using 
e/n/i for wireless by default after first boot has implications if the 
user (who is clueless) later installs a desktop environment.
Let's not dumb things down too much, network config is something people 
need to understand if they are booting to cli, IMO.
Thanks,
