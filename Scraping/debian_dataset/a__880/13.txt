If you can see a way to improve the information on the wiki, please go
ahead and do so -- that's what wikis are for, after all.

We also have a bug tracker, and patches are generally welcome.

Contributions can take a while to get incorporated, but if you come up
with an improvement for the documentation and/or the code (assuming that
it doesn't break things elsewhere) it will generally get used.
Please take notes during your testing, and try to find a way to use your
findings that will help people bumping into the same issue in future.

Thank you for your future contributuons :-)
Cheers, Phil.
