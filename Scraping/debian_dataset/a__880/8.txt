OKay that's a good start to the discussion.  But "not working isn;t 
the only thing to consider.  What about having TWO wireless devices 
active, would that be possible under the proposed arrangement?

Yeah that's what I was getting at, would any cganges be necessary to the 
gui doodads to make the proposal work at least as good as it does now?

That's your decision, I don't think it's smart to use bugtracker for 
this..  It's going to waste time of people who have a lot better things to 
do.
