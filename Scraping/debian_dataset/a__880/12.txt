I appreciate that you have reason for your paranoia, but in this case
it is entirely misplaced.  You have misunderstood me.  I meant this
part of Trent's suggestion:
|  If you don't want to udebify wpa_passphrase, you can do it by hand:

|      cat >"/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-$iface.conf" <<EOF
|      network={
|	 ssid="$ssid"
|	 psk="$passphrase"
|      }
|      EOF
which is part of a suggestion of how to configure ifupdown in the
installed system.

"Whatever".  Now, this thread is about Bug#694068.  Which is annoying
a number of people and should be fixed.

I struggle to see how fixing #694068 is about helping "thieves".
