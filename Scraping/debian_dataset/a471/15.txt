It seems something has changed /etc/default/console-setup. If this file 
is changed, then boot scripts of console-setup will recreate the 
cached_* files in /etc.
Do you know what has caused this file to be changed?  Its time seems to 
be only few minutes before the time of the reboot.  I can't think of 
anything in the scripts of console-setup that can cause changes in this 
file.
Something unrelated that might explain the bug is this: maybe this 
system runs X but doesn't have framebuffer on the console?  In this case 
the problem is hardware related and the best solution is to use 
framebuffer.
BTW, instead of `systemctl restart console-setup.service` you can use 
the command `setupcon`.
