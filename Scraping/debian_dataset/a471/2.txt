This very much sounds like a possible cause for what I am
observing and should be the path to follow first.
Note that this problem has been observed previously (there's
old, resolved bugs around this) which had a similar solution.
A, perhaps fairly drastic, solution might be to delay
setupcon font setting until all getty's have been started ?
Thanks,
Karsten
