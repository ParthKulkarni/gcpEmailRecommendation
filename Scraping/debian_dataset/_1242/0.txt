Yes, that is of course possible.  So "wait and see" it is. At least for now.
Other than forcing builds through the system is there another way for me to
check in, say, a week or two?  As documented, at least the i386 of
yesterday's r-base_3.5.1-2 seems "wrong".  Then again I can't really tell as
I have no i386 at hand...
