In Ubuntu, whilst debootstrap and all install methods default to
merged-usr from Disco+ the buildd chroots used by launchpad are not
merged-usr. Given that at the moment in Ubuntu we are choosing to not
force-merge users on upgrade. Granted, Launchpad does not accept
binary-uploads, thus things like these are easier to curate. But e.g.
one can create local chroots with --no-merged-usr passed to the
debootsrap and upload those binaries. But obviously buildd chroots
need to be switchted to --no-merged-usr as well for the time being
then.
Note this is a build-environment change, rather than target system
things. Possibly we should be encoding merged-usr in the buildinfo,
and e.g. using reproducible builds infra to do "build in
--no-merged-usr, rebuild in --merged-usr, result should be the same"
either as a one-off, or on the ongoing basis.
