Ideally the build system would correctly detect an usr-merged system
and set paths accordingly. While reverting the change on the build
machines temporarily (e.g. until the next release is out) feels
sensible, depending on how many issues we actually encounter, at some
point we'll have to go through with it. And knowing what actually
fails in this scenario and fixing the affected packages is a good
thing to do.
So, if you have the time, it might be useful to investigate whether
you or upstream can tweak the build system to e.g. explicitly assume a
split-user system even if the system the package is built on is
usr-merged.
I wonder how this was handled on other distributions when they made
the change - even if the change was applied on all systems, there must
have been at least one release where both modes were supported.
Cheers,
