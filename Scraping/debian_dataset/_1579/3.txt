Which is where I'm aiming this.  I use the unofficial live versions as
installation media because they install packages from local (USB) media
in less time that the network install, and I've used them for years
now.  They work fine, and the 15 minutes for local package installation
versus an hour to install across the 'Net is QUITE attractive.
It's only been recently (about a year,  I guess), that I've been using
the unofficial live xfce image (with the nonfree support included) to
try and install on two laptops.  The images install just fine over
ethernet, and everything hardware related works right after the
install.  Better results over using the netinst images, adding nonfree,
and getting wifi to work fine.
I'm moving to installing over wifi, now  (with the nonfree support in
use for wifi drivers FOR INSTALL) and it loops on installation at the
four steps described:  specify interface, agree to license, specify wifi
network, specify security, provide key, loop to specify wifi network,
and repeat over and over again.
It does it IIRC on all the installation images, so the bug is common to
all four <?> images.  I'm using 8.8.0, live, xfce, plus nonfree repository.
