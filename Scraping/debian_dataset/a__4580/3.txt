this list is about the development of Debian, while your question
clearly belongs to debian-user@lists.debian.org
that said, you need "deb-src" entries in /etc/apt/sources.list which
besides that need to be identical to those "deb" entries which are
already there. then run "sudo apt update" and after that "apt source
$packagename" will get you the sources.
