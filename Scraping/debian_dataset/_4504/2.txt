Country names are imported from iso-codes package.
That is to have one central place for this, instead of having
every project to maintain its own.
That is also documented here:
https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/doc/i18n/ch01s05.html
 
> So, please, prompt on how to translate country names into Tajik.
iso-codes repo is here:
https://salsa.debian.org/iso-codes-team/iso-codes
You can translate country names (ISO 3166-1) here:
https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/iso-codes/?utm_source=widget 
However Tajik is not activated there.
CC'ing Tobias as it's maintainer:
Tobias, could you please enable Tajik for ISO3166-1 ?
Thanks
