Well, it is worthy, but let's take a look at buildd options:
* amd64:          parallel=4
* arm64:          parallel=6
* armel:          parallel=4
* armhf:          parallel=4
* i386:           parallel=4
* mips:           parallel=4
* mips64el:       parallel=4
* mipsel:         parallel=4
* ppc64el:        parallel=4
* s390x:          parallel=2
* alpha:          parallel=2
* hppa:           parallel=1
* hurd-i386:      parallel=1
* ia64:           parallel=2
* kfreebsd-amd64: (buildd down)
* kfreebsd-i386:  (buildd down)
* m68k:           nobench nocheck
* powerpc:        parallel=4
* powerpcspe:     nobench nocheck
* ppc64:          parallel=32
* sh4:            nobench nocheck
* sparc64:        parallel=32
* x32:            parallel=2
(May differ per-buildd, I listed only one per arch.)
So this is _already_ done; at most individual packages might not use this
option, either via an explicit opt-out, or by having old crufty packaging.
Most of those packages are too small to bother; if you find one that fails
despite having a lengthy build, it'd be worth reporting.
However:

You're not expecting wishlist bugs to be fixed in oldstable, are you?

As others in the thread have already mentioned, -j is an old broken option
that probably should be removed, -J is the one to use; the preferred way is
to set DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=auto, although I think this is already the
default these days.
Meow!
