I assume you (re)start your service in postinst? In this case you need a
running systemd >= 235 at that point.
We do re-exec systemd in postinst, but a versioned Breaks or Conflicts
does not give you the guarantee that systemd.postinst has run before
your postinst.
This is not an issue for distros which do offline updates, but for
online updates this is problematic.
My advice would be, to only use features that systemd from stable provides.

Michael
