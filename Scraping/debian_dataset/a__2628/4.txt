Not a direct answer to the question you're asking, but you can get what
you want without having to preseed the priority back down again.
The 'auto' target is a shortcut that adds priority=critical and
auto=true so if you don't want the priority setting just add 'auto=true'
as well as the url setting to the normal target (IIRC 'install'), so:
  install auto=true url=...
I can imagine that you might still want to be able to preseed the
priority without provoking the menu to appear though, so that may not
actually address your issue.
Cheers, Phil.
