Package: main-menu
Severity: normal
I'd like to use preseeding to pre-answer some questions in the
installer, while leaving others for the user to answer, including
questions asked with priority "high".  Using "auto url=..." sets the
priority to critical, so I tried including the following in my preseed
file:
d-i debconf/priority high
When I did so, the installer displayed the main menu immediately after
processing the preseed file, rather than proceeding to the next step.
If preseeding the priority in this way breaks some assumption in
main-menu, please document how a preseed file can change the debconf
priority without causing the menu to display.
