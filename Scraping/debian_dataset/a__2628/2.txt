Yes, I managed to get that working in a VM.  It's longer to type,
though. :)
More importantly, leaving the priority at "high" for the initial run of
netcfg causes it to prompt for hostname and domain before it obtains and
loads the preseed file.  Hence wanting to start out at "critical" and
then lower the priority after processing the preseed file.
