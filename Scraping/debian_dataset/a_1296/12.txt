dgit uses the hashes in the .dsc, both during `dgit fetch' and during
`dgit import-dsc'.  Sponsorship workflows sometimes involve exchanging
or signing only .dscs.
But: I agree that this is not a release-critical bug.  For old .dsc's
(I assume we're not generating new ones) the security requirement is
second preimage resistance for old documents.  I think for .dscs this
will be OK for a while yet.
