Firstly, I don't think this follows.  It is right that the criteria
for accepting a new package are stricter than the criteria for
removing an existing one.
Secondly, the actual question of what should be in these packages is
precisely a policy question.  We should decide what our policy is and
then apply it.  (Of course examples can illuminate the policy.)  So I
don't think your queston can be answered until we know what the policy
should be.
By "don't disagree" I don't mean "agree".  I mean that the rejection
seems plausible and I haven't seen enough arguments to have a firm
opinion.
If the policy we decide on is that the packages with just symlinks
should be folded into the packages they provide links to, then yes
those packages should be fixed but it is IMO unlikely to be sensibly
considered an RC bug.
