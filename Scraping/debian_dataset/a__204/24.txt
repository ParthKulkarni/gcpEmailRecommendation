Well, I don't think it is your fault.  I myself have several times sat down to 
write a follow-up -- with an actual proposal, not just complaining :-) -- but 
also got distracted.  We're all busy.  But I am heartened to hear that you are 
working on it.  And I welcome the recent proposals by Ian and by Gert.
To me, one of the puzzling aspects is why the FTP policy work has been so 
secretive.  The release team has a mailing list, tech committee has a mailing 
list.  There is Debian Policy list.  It doesn't seem in congruence that the 
ftp team is making their policy behind closed doors.  Should it not flow from 
Debian Policy and be debated on open lists?
Or maybe it is all open and I simply haven't found it.  If so, I would 
gratefully accept pointers.  Concretely: where would one find the 
deliberations behind https://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html ?

P.S.  If I didn't strike the right tone in this email, then I do apologise.  
It is honestly not intended to be antagonistic, though I admit it does sound a 
bit whiny.
