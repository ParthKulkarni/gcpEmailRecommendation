This seems correct, from my reading of the Debian constitution.

I disagree with it not being in sync with Debian philosophy. The
Debian constitution is quite explicitly written to avoid concentrating
power in the hands of a single individual (the DPL), due to
unfortunate misuses of power long ago. It follows that power should
also not be concentrated into the hands of a small, self-electing
group (the technical commitee), either.

I'm not sure this would change the outcomes of ftp-master decisions. 
From experience, I find the team to have a pretty strong consensus and
would not expect the team as a whole to disagree with the decision of
a single team member. Overall, I think that's a good thing.
It might result in decision being more formally documented, perhaps.
That would probably be a good thing.

I'm opposed to this. We would need a GR to make this happen, since it
would need a change to the constitution. I for one would vote against
such a change.
(I express no opinion on the root complaint about circular build
dependencies and how we handle them.)
