I found the origin of the problem. It looks like it's this:
git commit -m 'releasing package apt-setup version 1:0.133' -a
/[master 436ef05] releasing package apt-setup version 1:0.133
 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)
git tag '1%0.133'
The relevant command is "debcommit --release -a"
It seems that debcommit changed its way to tags releases with an
epoch: up to recently, the epoch was just dropped, but now it is used,
but ":" is replaced by "%"
That indeed explains why I "suddenly" changed my tagging method
without even knowing.....
