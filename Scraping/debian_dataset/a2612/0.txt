The kernel modules package is provided and even pre-installed in the

that debian repository does not contain udeb packages with modules for 
my kernel. It cannot contain, because I haven't access to your repository.
Actually Both problems can be solved by packaging the kernel which 
provides a kernel deb and a kernel modules udeb which at the very 
least makes usb both fully functional and not use unnecessary kernel 
memory. The only times you don't want modules at all is on tuned 
setups for very narrow applications or for boards with no hotplug 
capability at all which means no usb which means at the very least the 
mouse will be a challenge.
I have the kernel package but net-retriever attempts to pick some 
package from your repository only. It does not see my kernel package 
despite it is bundled in the initrd image. I have prepared my own kernel 
installer which installs the kernel on target system. Hence I want to 
disable kernel installation by the bootstrap-base package.
