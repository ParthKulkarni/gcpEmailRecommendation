This comes out of different interpretations of whether builds that
sometimes fail (but often not) are RC buggy. You know that also I have a
different opinion here.
So, if you really want to have your interpretation to be the commonly
accepted one, you should discuss it here and see whether you reach a
common acceptance with your interpretation.
Otherwise it is IMO OK if a package maintainer has her own idea of
whether an occaisonal build failure is RC.
