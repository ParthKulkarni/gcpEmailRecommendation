I fully agree with you. I just think that it is not necessarily RC that
a CI test is unfixed.
The point here is: the proposed plan is to make CI test failures in
reverse dependencies a direct migration excuse, which can only be
overwritten by the release team.
I find this too unflexible, and propose that instead the failing CI test
should create an RC bug assigned to the updated package, affecting the
failing package. This would 
* document the bug on the place where all bugs are documented, and keep
  it in our eternal bug database, allowing to search for it etc.
* enable all the possibilities an open bug has, like discussion,
  re-assignment, severity change etc.
* better link the d/changelog entry to the problem ("Increasing
  tolerance in picky test. Closes: #123456" instead of "... to fix a CI
  test failure with updated grampf package")

Nice picture :-)

At least, I would not like to go to a coctail party where the host
announces that he kicks out the people for that reason. This should be
on the decision of the parents Ã¤Ã¤Ã¤h maintainers.
IMO, we should trust the maintainer and their decisions until there is
no experience that it doesn't work. Which means: keep the maintainer
fully responsible on the package, including the ability to lower
severity of a CI test or any other bug. Only if we experience that this
doesn't work, we need other measures.
Best regards
Ole
