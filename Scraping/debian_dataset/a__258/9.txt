LOL, but I don't see a lot of social exclusion here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=sanvila@debian.org;tag=ftbfs-randomly
Sometimes I've seen maintainers downgrade FTBFS bugs to "wishlist"!
Surely I will not invite those maintainers to a party, but they are
still maintaining Debian packages.
Should I ask the Technical Committee to rule out that FTBFS bugs are RC,
even if they did not happen in buildd.debian.org yet?
Thanks.
