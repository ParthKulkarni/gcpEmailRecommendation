There exists no "auto-bug-filing" tool that people approve of for this
kind of purpose.  You are very welcome to introduce such a tool - I
would be happy to see it for FTBFS regressions on buildds.
  In the absence of such a tool, existing and future QA checks for
gating will be implemented directly in Britney.  Mind you, even if such
a auto-bug-filing tool were created, there will always be control checks
in Britney that will only be overridable by the release team.
Personally, I do not have the capacity to create such a tool.  Instead,
I have been working on making Britney's migration policy decisions
available in a machine-parsable format (available from [1]).
  It is still WIP[2], but it does include piuparts, aging and RC bugs
blockers.  Plus it would also include autopkgtests information once we
add that.
  Ideally, I would finish that up and have it integrated into
tracker.d.o or/and UDD (related dep: DEP-2?).
Thanks,

[2] If you are considering to import this data set, please let me know.
We still tweak the format/values now and then, so it is better if I can
notify you in advance, rather than break your importer without knowing it.
Related note: Feedback from prospective importers welcome (please follow
up in a separate thread).
