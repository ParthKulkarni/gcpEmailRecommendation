Hello Cyril,
Thanks for looking into this.

No, I can't confirm this.
Normally we use a http proxy during installation/preseeding ( squid-deb-proxy and with "d-i mirror/http/proxy string ..." in preseed config)
Therefor when using the "normal" mirror ftp.de.debian.org I can see in the squid logs that the installer request InRelease, Release, Release.gpg, Packages.xz
whereas when using snapshot.debian.org it requests InRelease, Release, Release.gpg, Packages.xz, Packages.gz, Packages (which is answered with http status code 404)
So Packages.gz, Packages are requested in addition when using snapshot.debian.org.
Here is an excerpt of the squid logs:

Yes, I can reproduce the issue every time.
To debar squid-deb-proxy from being the cause of the problem I disabled the "d-i mirror/http/proxy string ..." preseed setting and now it works !
I tried several times without http proxy and each time it succeeded to install from snapshot.debian.org.
So it looks like squid-deb-proxy is the problem and not Debootstrap !
The strange thing is that squid-deb-proxy works just fine with ftp.de.debian.org but it fails with snapshot.debian.org for stretch (but it used to work with jessie).
I believe that something goes wrong with squid while or just after downloading http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20170618T160104Z/dists/stretch/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
I also flushed the squid cache but it then again fails at the same point (even on the first run when it gets a TCP_MISS)
 
Thanks
