Package: debootstrap-udeb 1.0.89
Version: 1.0.89
I am trying to install Debian Stretch from snapshot.debian.org e.g. with this preseed configuration:
  d-i mirror/protocol string http
  d-i mirror/country string manual
  d-i mirror/http/hostname string snapshot.debian.org
  d-i mirror/http/directory string /archive/debian/20170618T160104Z
During the Installation, among others files these are requested:
  http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20170618T160104Z/dists/stretch/main/binary-amd64/Packages.xz
  http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20170618T160104Z/dists/stretch/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
  http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20170618T160104Z/dists/stretch/main/binary-amd64/Packages
But the latter, "Packages" does not exists and returns a http 404 error, causing the deboottrap installer to stop and throw an error.
Whereas if using this mirror settings:
  d-i mirror/protocol string http
  d-i mirror/country string manual
  d-i mirror/http/hostname string ftp.de.debian.org
  d-i mirror/http/directory string /debian
.. dbootstrap accesses Packages.xz and Packages.xz but NOT Packages and therefor the installation works just fine.
  http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/binary-amd64/Packages.xz
  http://security.debian.org/debian-security/dists/stretch/updates/main/binary-amd64/Packages.xz
Background: I need to use snapshot.debian.org to be able to setup 100% identicall systems.
This is to make sure that dev, test, qa and prod systems have the excact same software installed.
We first update dev & test to 20170618T160104Z and if that passes all test we also update prod to 20170618T160104Z after a week.
Why is "Packages" requested if using snapshot.debian.org ?
Thanks
