Hello,
I now made dozens of test installing from snapshot.debian.org  and I get random problems.
Most of the time i get a Debootstrap Error that dist/stretch/main/binary-amd64/Packages could not be retrieved
but also libacl1, adduser, and others can't be downloaded.
Installing from ftp.de.debian.org always works.
I am now very sure that the problem is that snapshot.debian.org is very unreliable.
Can you please assign this bug to "Package: snapshot.debian.org" ?
Thanks
