Wouter, I very much do not agree with your argumentation. Please read
this video:
https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2018/DebConf18/2018-07-30/server-freedom-why-choosing-the-cloud-op.webm
Having the underlying infrastructure to fully run free software is super
important, for many reasons. For example, because you can completely
reproduce it on your own hardware if you feel like it's the correct
thing to do, and then migrate your data to it. Also, using a free
implementation avoids vendor lock-in, and provides proven (and tested on
a CI, for the case of OpenStack) interoperability.
And there's what Jeremy replied to you. We shall not endorse non-free.
I've been fighting for software freedom on the servers for nearly all of
my professional career, and reading what you wrote makes me really sad.
IMO you haven't understood what the problem is.
Though what I agree very much about, is that we'd get more freedom if we
were self-hosting fully. One always do.
Cheers,
