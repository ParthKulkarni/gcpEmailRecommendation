That notion might not be written down somewhere, but when I open an
account on a platform, I basically consent to whatever the platform
administrators do with my data. Would you agree with that? And then if
there is a change in how platform administrators handle my data, I would
like to be able to consent to that. Even if it is non identifying data.

Exactly. And my question is: do we (Salsa admins precisely) have total
control over this or not?

Works for me. As said, I simply mentioned this, because Marco made it
sound like we would have to pay if we'd switch to another such provider.
But "we" already pay for it. Thanks for making it clear.

I lack the reasoning to arrive at the same conclusion.
