That does make sense. However, if the free software on top of whatever
cloud infrastructure we choose to use already supports multiple cloud
providers (as is the case here), then you already do avoid that same
vendor lock-in.
It would be totally different if we were talking about something that
can only be done by Google Compute Engine; say, if the salsa
administrators wrote the necessary code themselves and did not even
consider looking at a free implementation. Were that the case, I would
agree with you. But that's not what this is about.

I do; I just don't agree that, *in this specific instance*, it applies.

Exactly. We should encourage that when we can; but we should not fault
the salsa administrators for deciding they don't have the time for that,
and for choosing a third party cloud infrastructure, *for storage only*.
When the cloud provider is used for only a minimal part of the problem
space (as is the case here), and when the software in use allows for
easy switching to another cloud provider (as is the case here), then the
advantages of choosing a cloud provider that uses free software to
provide the required service become very slim indeed. What use is free
software when you can't exercise the rights anyway, as is the case with
a third-party installation of free software cloud infrastructure?
One could say that we might want to do so anyway, for political reasons,
and I would definitely agree with you. But that ship has sailed when we
chose gitlab over the really free software alternatives that also exist.
