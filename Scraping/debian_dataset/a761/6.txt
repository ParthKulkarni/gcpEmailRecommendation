Has the Salsa team redacted specs prior to implementing the current
cloud storage solution? If yes, where can these specs be found?
If you haven't redacted such specs, would you be willing to provide
those somewhere, even in a keywordish manner? Otherwise, is there any
technical documentation (or as a fallback: code & manifests) about this
implementation publicly accessible?
Having such documents might help avoid running in the wrong direction
and would also allow to gather more overall insight.
