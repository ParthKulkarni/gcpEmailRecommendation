First, there's dozens of OpenStack public cloud out there, so you're not
locked-in with a single operator. Then there's not a single contributor
to the OpenStack source code, the contributors are quite diverse.
To the contrary, if you're using a proprietary cloud like AWS, you have
no choice but to continue with them.

I'd like to understand better what the need and usage is. Could you
please expand? Do you need to store blobs, like with Swift? Maybe swift
is more adapted to the use case, if we only need to store blobs? Swift
is also a way more easy to deploy and maintain than a Ceph cluster,
which requires careful monitoring of daemons if you don't want it to
fall apart.

I was talking specifically about interoperability tests from one
OpenStack version to the next. OpenStack clients are designed to work
with *any* version of OpenStack, and they are supposed to work even some
very old deployments. And that's the thing that is tested in the CI. I
may be wrong, but so far, I haven't head that any of the big 4 non-free
clouds having such thing for their client API, and even if they did, it
would make little sense, as they don't have the interoperability problem
to take care of (they just need to be compatible with themselves).
Other free IaaS implementation may have the feature also, but
free-software public cloud providers are almost always using OpenStack
anyway, so interoperability, really, is a unique selling point here for
OpenStack.

Well, it's a question of view. To me, having Salsa to host some of its
data on Google is a kind of tacit endorsement. Even worse, it gives the
message that, from the viewpoint of the whole Debian community, it's ok
to host there. Clearly, I'm not the only one bothered in this way.

Sure, of course.
