That is a point I very much agree with in principle.
But I am not sure if a package structure like
mypkg/upstream/*
mypkg/debian/*
mypkg/patches/* (?)
would have any *practical* benefits over the current situation, because
this transformation could be trivially automated in either direction.
Or did you have something else in mind?
