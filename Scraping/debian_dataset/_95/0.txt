The overall difference between both approaches is about who does the  
rendering of the systray icon and its menu.
The xembed protocol is described here [1]. It is fully based on X11  
windows and reparenting and does not at all care about content, menu  
structures, widgets. The specification is really really old.
The AppIndicator approach is content gnostic. The applet hands over  
the menu tree to the renderer and the renderer does the rendering. UI  
integration, theming integration and a11y integration is fully  
controlled by the renderer (on a GTK3 desktop, this is some sort of  
GTK3 toolkit stuff that does the rendering, whereas on a Qt5 based  
desktop, this is done by some Qt5 toolkit stuff).
With xembed, the user is pretty much left alone, esp. regarding a11y  
integration (esp. keyboard control of the systray area).
In Ayatana Indicators, we will provide a system indicator that will  
become container for xembed based applications. Furthermore, MATE's  
notification area applet (that hosts xembedded apps currently) is not  
planned to be removed any time soon (AFAIK).
And as I said earlier, lib(ayatana-)appindicator falls back to xembed,  
if no SNI provider is around on the user session DBus.
However, when people start writing a new application and want to dock  
it to the panel... They should not use xembed anymore.
And: I am fully aware of the xembed-removal history in GNOME/Unity7  
[2]. That was not fun at all 5 years ago. We won't copy that  
over-assumptuous flaw again. Legacy support is important, so xembed  
support needs to stay, while people should be encourage to go the  
AppIndicator way for new and actively maintained applications.

Hope that soothes things a bit,
