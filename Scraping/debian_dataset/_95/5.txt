OK, I guess we can cross that bridge when we come to it.  It doesn't

This seems undesirable to me.  As a user, will I be able to continue
to use the xembed approach indefinitely ?

Thanks.  I read your link.  Perhaps my use of the word `rationale' was
unclear.  I meant, what is the reason.  "In SNI the panel does the
rendering" is part of the design but does not explain why that
design choice was made.
The page you refer to says simply:

 | responsible for the rendering and the behavior of their tiny

I discussed this when I wrote this:

So as I say the desire for uniformity does not seem to explain the
change in protocol.

There must surely be a way in Wayland for one application to swallow
or contain another.  This is far from am unusual requirement.  (The
details of the Xembed tray protocol would have to have been redone, I
suppose.)
It seems to me that the new proto is strictly worse than the old one.
It has fewer capabilities.  In particular, it is not possible, with
the new protocol, to make applets which deviate from the uniform SNI
UI.  It is unarguable that such deviation is sometimes desirable,
since no doubt there are users who prefer it.
ISTM therefore that the old protocol needs to be retained
indefinitely.  That might mean that in Wayland some applets (that want
a richer UI) run in Wayland's X11 emulation, but I don't see a problem
with that.  Nor do I see a problem with retaining that indefinitely.

Thanks for the explanation.  I had understood this from reading the
earlier links.

Jolly good.

I don't think I agree, for the reasons discussed above.

So far, as I say, I don't see particular reasons for this.
I think that application authors should be encouraged to use whatever
interface seems most convenient for them.  If the applet-facing APIs
provided for SNI meet their needs, and are convenient, then the applet
author can choose SNI.
If on the other hand, the SNI APIs are not convenient, or the applet
author wants a richer UI than supported by SNI, then the xembed
approach may be better.
An applet written in Tcl/Tk is a good example of a case where xembed
is probably better, since Tcl's tk-tktray package provides an
interface which is simultaneously extremely convenient for the
programmer, and powerful and flexible.  It is hard to see how the
dbus-based SNI approach would fit nicely into Tcl/Tk.
> Hope that soothes things a bit,
Yes.  Thanks for taking the time to engage and explain.
I still don't quite agree with all the design decisions here, as you
will see, but it's not my design or my code.  If I can continue to use
xembed indefinitely then I'm content.
Regards,
Ian.
