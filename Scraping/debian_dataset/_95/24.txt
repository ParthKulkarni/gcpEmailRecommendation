HI Cl√©ment,

There is no direct Perl module, but the libayatana-appindicator shared  
lib has gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator-0.1. So you should be good when  
using GIO in Perl, if you are on GTK3 already. (The  
perl-Gtk2-Appindicator module has indeed been recently removed from  
Debian to discourage work on appindicator based on GTK2).
Yes. With GTK3 you would implement the Xembed based systray icon with  
GtkStatusIcon and attach a GtkMenu to that.
With AppIndicator, you will use the API provided by  
libayatana-appindicator for creating your systray icon. For now, we  
have to use Ubuntu's docs (it is on my todo list to port the  
implementation examples over to the Ayatana Indicators' web site) [1].  
Unfortunately, the porting guide has no Perl example, but with GIO  
this should be easily transferable from e.g. Python code examples.
If you want to provide support for GtkStatusIcon and Ayatana  
AppIndicator, you may want to study the transmission-gtk code [2]  
(written in C, though).
You could also drop the GtkStatusIcon based implementation entirely  
and fully switch over to Ayatana AppIndicator. When doing that, you  
loose the right-click menu (I must re-check that, if that is really  
fully true). On desktops that don't provide the StatusNotifierItem  
interface, your application will fallback to Xembed.
Staying with Xembed-only support is IMHO not recommendable, because  
e.g. GNOME (and derivatives) are continuously discussing the removal  
of Xembed support in their desktop env.
