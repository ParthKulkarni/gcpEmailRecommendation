So welcome in our new sub-team :-)
My idea for the installer was basically, to send a call for translation
updates to all languages, which are outdated, means searching for new
translators for those languages on the relevant l10n lists.
However, at debconf a new intend was called out to change the whole 
translation infrastructure for the installer (in the long term of course,
no quick actions to be expected IMO).
This is why I'm somewhat unsure how to proceed...
Should I try for recruiting new translators, even if the workflow changes
heavily some time later?
Recruiting new translators means explanation of workflow to some degree, what
would be to no avail, if infrastructure changes.
Thoughts?
Holger
