Oh, you're concerned with what upstream tarballs Debian can consume
without repackaging.
I don't see any reason why this should prevent GCC from releasing tarballs
compressed with lzip if they want to.  They certainly wouldn't stop
releasing tarballs in other formats, for a host of reasons, and Debian can
just use one of the other formats.
In other words, this is a "fake" dependency; there is nothing about
Debian's tools or formats that prevents GCC from releasing tarballs with
lzip.
Debian is the last project that you should wait for to make a decision
like this.  We're very unlikely to adopt lzip as a native upstream tarball
format until it is in very widespread use elsewhere.  (That's the pattern
followed with previous formats except for lzma, and I think our somewhat
premature adoption of lzma support is now seen as a mistake we shouldn't
repeat.)  We are *extremely* conservative about source package formats
because, once we adopt one, we have to support it for nearly forever;
phasing one out again is quite difficult.
