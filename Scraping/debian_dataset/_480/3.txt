When I try to package execline(a non-interactive shell script)[1], it 
installs following binaries in default PATH,
Three of them (cd, umask, wait) clash with shell's regular built-in 
utilities. POSIX requires them to be exec(2)able[0][1]. Debian doesn't 
currently provide standalone executables for them (which is a bug), but 
some other distros do. The execline's implementation are of course not 
compatible with POSIX, and therefore must not be included within PATH.
