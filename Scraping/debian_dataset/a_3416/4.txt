I replied in my other mail to the things I disagreed with (as is
traditional) but it occurred to me I ought to send a positive note
about this:

I also commend the phrasing of your original question with `why'.
That could be read as rhetorical, but even so it invited a reasoned
disagreement.
Regards,
Ian.
