Well, removing broken functionality is a fair deal. And implementing a
systemd-only version is as well - afterall, it is his decision on how
he spends his time and which usecases he supports. It helps nobody to
have someone write code for a feature they don't actually use (the
result will be bad in any case, due to limited testing).
This situation would have an easy fix though: People who do care about
SysVInit could provide a patch to fix the broken functionality.
Debian lives from collaboration, and if enough people care about a
feature (like SysVInit support) and work on it, that particular
feature will be supported. If on the other hand, no work is done to
keep the feature alive, its codepaths will first deteriorate and after
a while it will be removed entirely.
So, tl;dr and what a lot of people have said before: SysVInit needs
developers interested or paid to work on it to stay alive in Debian.
It also requires users to find and report bugs related to it. A new
build profile will not magically create developers to address SysVInit
issues.
Cheers,
