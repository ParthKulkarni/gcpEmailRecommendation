Guys, please stop.  This kind of trolling is not helpful.
Especially you two shouldn't be fighting.  As far as I know, Svante is
somewhat involved with eudev maintenance in Devuan (done mostly by parazyd,
though), while Marco has a great wealth of udev experience.
eudev is currently not needed for Debian, but it's good to have ready and
tested packages we can import when/if udev becomes systemd only (which can
happen at any moment as its upstream we don't control).
Meow!
