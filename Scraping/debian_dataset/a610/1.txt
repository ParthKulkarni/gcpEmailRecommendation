There was at least some impression that the lists.d.o maintainers
weren't enthusiastic of absorbing a large number of team maintainer
addresses as lists.  This came up when I was asking if we should
migrate filesystems-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org to list.d.o, and one
of the primary maintainers on filesystems-devel thought that was
frowned upon.
Is there something official from the lists.d.o maintainers about what
their preferences should be?
Thanks,
