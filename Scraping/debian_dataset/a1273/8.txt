On the Mustang, you need to be using the firmware-provided
DTB. Assuming a sane, recent UEFI firmware things USB boot should work
just fine. I got it working for the first Jessie point release too,
after doing a temporary build in
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/arm64-mustang/ .
I've not tested a stretch installation directly on a Mustang
lately. The machine I used for the jessie testing has since been
repurposed as a buildd. I'll see if I can access to test another.
