I like that this *finally* gets some traction. I have floated a GR
before but people seem to be reluctant to have yet another vote.
I guess the question from my side is if the list of archive components
in Â§5 of the Social Contract is supposed to be exhaustive or not. I.e.
if we need to change that or not. If we don't need to: yay. (Maybe
because we editorially consider firmware not to be software or something.)
Is that something the secretary could tell us? :P
Kind regards and thanks
