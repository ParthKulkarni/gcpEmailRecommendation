Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.87
Severity: normal
  Therefore you usually have to setup an SD card with the appropriate u-boot
  version for your particular device (see below) as a prerequisite for
  installing Debian. If you use the pre-made SD card images with the
  installer, this step is not necessary, as these images already contain
  u-boot.

This seems to fall squarely in flash-kernel's wheelhouse, since it
already handles the other parts of u-boot installation, and it knows
the name of the board being installed.
The d-i SD card images avoid the problem, but they are only one way to
install; there are even other ways to use d-i to install that need this
manual step first.
The main difficulty in putting it in flash-kernel is that it might be
installed in a chroot in a situation where it should not be altering
the boot sector of the host's disk. So, something like grub-installer
seems to be called for, so the user specifies the device to install to.
A utility in flash-kernel would be much nicer than needing to puzzle out dd
commands from README.Debian files and hope you got it right. I'm currently
having to embed those dd commands inside propellor; they're also embedded
inside debian-installer (build/boot/arm/u-boot-image-config).
