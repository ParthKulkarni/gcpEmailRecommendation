Unfortunately the fixes have caused a regression in infocmp, see
#868266.  I expect an upstream fix this night, but to properly test it
and prepare new packages taking a bit more time seems advisable.  So I
guess we'll have to defer that for 9.2.

The changes do not touch the tinfo library which is all that shipped in
the udeb.
