Hello Hans
The earlier message in this thread mentioned that Debian Testing is
"frozen".  You'll find more information about what this means here:
    https://release.debian.org/stretch/freeze_policy.html
though that document is really written for people who are familiar with
Debian development.  I'm not sure whether there's a document for those
less familiar with the release process.
In short, "debian testing" isn't getting new versions of software right
now, and hasn't for some months, as a step towards making Stretch the
next stable release of Debian.  Only once Stretch is released will
"testing" (which will then be known by the codename "Buster") start
getting new versions from "unstable".
