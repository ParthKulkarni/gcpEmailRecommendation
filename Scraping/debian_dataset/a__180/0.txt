Hi Andrey,
> Now please look in experimental.
Yes, I saw it in experimental. However, I wondered, why it is still not in 
unstable or testing, because in Kali it is already since weeks. 
> Please also remember that we are currently frozen.
Of course, I forgot. This is an explanation, of course. No problem. 
However, I just wanted to point to the binaries of kali (I know, that there 
are also Ubuntu packages, but I do not trust Ubuntu packages, as they might 
destroy my system). I had the hope, that a look to kali might reduce your work 
and help.
Please do not see it as mourning, see it as a hint.
Best regards
Hans
