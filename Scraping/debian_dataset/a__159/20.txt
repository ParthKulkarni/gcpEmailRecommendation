gbp import-orig --uscan (the whole import with git-dpm is flawed, there
are too many ways to fail, like a patch that cannot be rebased and the
pristine-tar branch is not updated, like the previous upstream was not
tagged because not released [and git-dpm only tags upstream when master
is tagged] and it fails in the middle of the process, gbp rollbacks when
there is a problem).
