Yeah, I think we heard before that git-dpm is not being maintained. I
said it, Vincent said it in his reply, and now you are saying it
again. No one is disputing the point.

Yes, it is a mess. But I don't think it's any worse than having to
resolve conflicts in debian/patches/, which is the equivalent problem
when multiple people use gbp at the same time.

I don't understand... how does a Debian package upload affect any of the
work on your git-dpm tree?
Best,
