The best looking solution seems to be, to make it dynamically depending on architecture,
something like this:
- en/boot-installer/arm.xml:  <sect2 arch="arm" id="boot-tftp"><title>Booting by TFTP</title>
+ en/boot-installer/arm.xml:  <sect2 arch="arm" id="boot-tftp-&architecture;"><title>Booting by TFTP</title>
which builds fine.
If we would do it this way: should it be changed globally to this approach (means: 
those  occurrences, which I just changed to static "i386", "powerpc" etc. values,
have to be changed once more) or only change it for those cases which require it.
Changing it globally to &architecture; looks more future-proof and thus the best
way to go ...
