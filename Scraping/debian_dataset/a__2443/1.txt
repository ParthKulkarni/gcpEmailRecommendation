The bug has been open for 9 years and no m68k porter has looked at it. 
Ususally apr test failures are toolchain/kernel/libc issues, so my 
motivation to debug this for a very slow arch that has zero chance of ever 
being part of a Debian release is very small.

Sorry, I did not know that the ports use the official buildd website 
nowadays. Is there some tool like rmadison but that includes all 
inofficial ports, too?
And the build log [1] seems to be built with "notest" so it does not help 
for checking if the test failure still happens.
Cheers,
Stefan
