Hi Cyril! 
I agree that it's not essential for d-i; although, it's worth
mentioning that zstd seems like it will more likely satisfy users who
are coming from zfs' "lz4 compression is usually beneficial" school of
thought than lzo will.
Dmitri, does btrfs send/receive actually require userspace libzstd?
Or is it needed for defrag? (rewrites files, and also optionally
applies, removes, or changes compression type) I'm guessing that
btrfs-check requires it. (check --repair is, broadly speaking,
equivalent to 'fsck.ext4 -p')
The worst-case d-i bloat for an official arch seems to be 193.4kB for
i386, before compression.  Would you please 'reassign -1 libzstd' if
you agree that Debian's rescue mode should support cloning/restoring
subvolumes with compressed files, and/or being able to repair the
(unmounted) rootfs?  It seems strange that buster's initramfs has this
functionality and that rescue mode doesn't.  Alternatively, the btrfs
binary in the udeb could be statically linked...
Thanks,
Nicholas
