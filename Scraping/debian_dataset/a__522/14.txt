Hi,
Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org> (2018-01-12):

It seems zstd is only an option for btrfs-progs, and I've just confirmed
that setting --disable-zstd on the dh_auto_configure line lets btrfs-progs
build just fine, without the libzstd1 dependency. As far as I can tell,
there's no absolute need for this feature in d-i, and we could consider
building the udeb without zstd support, instead of requesting the addition
of a libzstd1-udeb. What do you think?
Cheers,
