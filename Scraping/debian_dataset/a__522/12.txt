There were no mails on debian-boot@, so that addition wasn't announced
nor coordinated.

If that wasn't clear from the context: I'm interested in udebs
specifically, and while I'm going to have to disagree with “marginally
better”, that would still be a net win when the cost is zero.

That looks like d-i 101: having a consistent set of packages within a
given suite is the best way to avoid issues.

It seems like not liking -V (again, only used by udebs when symbols
files are present for debs) doesn't look like a good reason to get more
complexity in the symbols handling…
The upload we're talking about (that I only quickly glanced at) actually
bumped the version of all symbols to the last version, meaning it
actually mimicked having passed the horrendous -V flag! I'm not sure how
a symbols syntax extension would have helped get the basics straight…

As I think I've mentioned already, the bare minimum is mailing
debian-boot@, which didn't happen. And yes, bonus points if I'm in cc
(that's really appreciated); people would usually loop me in if I'm late
to the party (which happens after the fact when people mentioned the
package was sitting in NEW); and if I miss mails on debian-boot@ because
I'm lagging behind, fault's on me.

I'm not sure what the problem with that is.
Yes, sometimes udebs need to wait for other packages to migrate
together because of that “inflated” version. But usually I'm the one
reviewing those issues and adding age-days/urgent hints as needed on the
release team side, when a bunch of packages are wanted in the next d-i
release.

But it's not.

It's served us (or at least me) for many years, so I'll keep on relying
on it, sorry if that's so irritating.
Cheers,
