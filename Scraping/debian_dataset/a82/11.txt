Also IME that hard work is made significantly easier by having a curated
patch series that keeps the Debian changes in semantically-separate
chunks.  (Especially true for cases like OpenSSH where some of the
patches correspond to externally-maintained patch sets - though in
practice upstream for said patch sets has been fallow for some time, but
at least in theory!)
