Just chiming in here as package maintainer of an effected package, OpenMW
and also an upstream developer of said software, along with contributor to
OpenSceneGraph.
Here are some related open bugs involving Qt and GLESv2 and arm*:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850021
^-- RM: openmw [armhf] -- RoQA; needs OSG built against libGL
The editor of OpenMW uses osgQt, which is provided by OSG. OSG has to pick,
Desktop GL or GLESv2 it can't be both and because GLESv2 was forced on
armhf and armel for Qt, then OSG had to do the same because of one of their
plugins (now deprecated in OSG-3.6) links against Qt. The result is that
OpenMW can't be built/shipped on armhf/armel on Debian because it only
supports OpenGL 2.0 fixed function pipeline.
If you say that arm64 has to be GLESv2 as well, then that is yet another
arch that OpenMW can't be built for.  Before the GLESv2 switch, OpenMW
worked just fine on arm* hardware, including the Raspberry Pi/Raspbian with
the VC4 mesa driver that has OpenGL 2.0 support.
Another related bug:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=852423
^--  revert all arm* changes to OSG and drop osgQt support in order to
compile against libGL (Desktop GL). A radical solution, but it would allow
for applications like OpenMW to run (but not the editor).
My merge-request on Salsa was already merged in for OSG-3.6 that does this,
since osgQt is no longer shipped with OSG, we no longer needed Qt nor the
GLESv1/2 support.
https://salsa.debian.org/openscenegraph-team/openscenegraph-3.6/merge_requests/1
I beg you, please either reverse the GLES decision in Qt or provide two
separate packages for GL or GLES support.
Cheers,
Bret
