As discussed on debian-devel, however, binary packages built on a
merged-usr system are not installable on a non-merged-usr system.
Obviously we would like ad hoc builds of packages from one stretch
machine to be installable on other stretch machines.
I do not see any way in which this could be resolved for stretch.
Accordingly, please urgently revert this change for stretch-backports.
Ian.
(I have CC'd debian-release@lists because this seems like it wants the
attention of the stable release team.  I wasn't able to find a
separate contact address for the stable release team here
  https://www.debian.org/intro/organization
and I have a vague memory that this is somehow the same list.  Please
redirect me if I am wrong.)
