And you'd still have cases like "someone installed something in 
/usr/local/bin" and such. Might be easier to just track whether it was 
built in a dsa-maintained autobuilder, so a human can identify potential 
local build environment issues as a possible explanation for unexpected 
behavior because that's really the objective. Might also not be worth 
trying to do that vs existing ways to find out where the package was 
built.
