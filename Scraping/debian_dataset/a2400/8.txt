There are many many many pieces of software in Debian which work better
or allow you to do more if you change some system-wide configuration.
For instance, Samba will work better as a server if you install and
enable nss_winbind; and there are a number of web applications which
work better if you enable particular apache modules.
If we were to add options for all of those things in the installer, then
we'd end up with an installer you couldn't use anymore.

Yes, that's how it works, generally.
If you want to make that easier, nobody's stopping you from documenting
it, or submitting a patch to virt-manager to help with making the
necessary changes. But the installer isn't involved with
virtualisation, and therefore I think it doesn't make sense to make
those changes there.

This ignores the inconvenience factor for everyone who ends up with a
broken system because you added configuration which they don't need and
which conflicts with the things that they do need.
