Actually, you can just tell virt-manager to use the "default" network,
which is configured correctly. However, it does not come enabled out of
the box; to fix, you can do one of two things; either run "virsh
net-autostart default; virsh net-start default", or use the virt-manager
UI to do the same (under Edit->Connection details->Virtual networks)
This uses NAT, and creates a virtual NIC, which therefore requires root
access; but it works nicely IME.

Very few.

if you happen to be in an enviroment where there are conflicting network
configurations active, things will break badly.
