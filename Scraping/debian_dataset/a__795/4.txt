Surely we can then asses that the intend of our upstreams in such cases 
is schizophrenic: They _both_ want to dillute the copyleft licensing 
_and_ uphold it strongly.
Because our job as distributors is not to respect what upstreams 
explicitly dictate through licensing, but to second-guess what is 
_really_ going on in their minds - and when their mindset and ours do 
not align, then surely they cannot be trusted to mean what the say - our 
need for simple distribution has higher priority than their right to 
grant complex licensing.
Right?
