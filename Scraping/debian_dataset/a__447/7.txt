"collectively" = noone is feeling responsible and nothing gets done
In a project the size of Debian there are plenty of tasks this size or 
even bigger, and usually they get done if and only if there are one
or few people who consider themselves responsible.
In the case of Berkeley DB, this means there has to be someone who
takes care of that for several years until the removal is finished.
Someone might have the name Lionel. ;-)
"small goals" also have the problem that there is no bigger picture.
As an example, I am the maintainer of bogofilter.
bogofilter supports several DB backends, but virtually all users are
using the Berkeley DB one.
If I would drop the Berkeley DB backend in a release where Debian
does still support Berkeley DB, I'd just screw the users of my
package for no good reason.
