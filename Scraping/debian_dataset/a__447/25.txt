I suppose I should have searched better :)
Looks like although several packages which (used to) depend on libdb5.3
were removed or modified, most weren't... and an updated version of that
list would therefore not learn us much.
Out of curiosity, which tool was used to obtain this list, BTW ? There's
nothing too obvious to me in apt, apt-get, apt-cache or the Tracker Web
interface.
In order to sort libdb5.3's reverse dependencies by popularity, I could
whip up a q&d Perl script to query the popcon Web interface in a loop,
or probably better, to parse the raw text in the by_inst page. But isn't
there already a way to do that ? :)
A generic search engine query wasn't helpful.
Thanks,
Lionel.
