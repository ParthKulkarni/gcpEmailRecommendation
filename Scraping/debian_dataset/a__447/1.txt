Indeed. The weight of apt-utils (#65 popcon by_inst), and even more so
of libpam-modules (#5 !), in libdb5.3's popularity is probably pretty
high. Even if both of those dependencies went away, libdb5.3 would
remain quite popular anyway due to Perl, Python (2 and 3), and others.

Could that program conceivably be split to another package ?
This also goes for libpam-modules, where pam_userdb.so is the only user
of libdb5.3.
Of course, I probably don't foresee all of the consequences of such
changes - maybe splits are harder to perform on essential packages, to
begin with ?

Heh. Neither do I see myself for such a task :)
Miriam's suggestion (BTW: thanks Miriam for some Debian packaging
example I used years ago at work) makes sense.
Thanks,
Lionel.
