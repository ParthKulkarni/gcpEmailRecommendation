Aha. And the page you mention shows that moving to dpkg the
functionality of apt-extracttemplates, which IIUC contributes more to
the popularity of apt-utils than the two other tools in that package,
has nontrivial work dependencies.

Indeed, that would be literally moving the problem, though it might make
sense if it makes it easier to reach the main goals later.
But in this case, AIUI, adding support for another database backend with
suitable reliability, performance and security characteristics to
apt-ftparchive, which you hinted at earlier, would cause less disruption
than my possibly naive idea of splitting packages, wouldn't it ?
