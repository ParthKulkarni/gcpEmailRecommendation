I agree that the database cache makes a substantial difference at this
scale.  On the occasions when we've suffered corruption and had to
rebuild it, it's taken on the order of 12 hours for a single suite,
while normal runs are more like 15-20 minutes.

I don't blame you!

It's true that Launchpad uses apt-ftparchive for the Ubuntu archive.  We
publish PPAs directly from our database rather than going via
apt-ftparchive, but we've never quite managed to get that to perform
acceptably at the scale of the Ubuntu archive.  I suppose it might be
worth another go.
