No, when taken alone, -dev packages Recommending -doc is just right.  There
are very limited cases when you're writing code for a library's API but
don't have an use for its primary documentation.  A person who downloads
the source to mess with the code you've written is also well served by
having the docs available.  On the other hand, the buildds have no use for
documentation (no human in the chroot), and here our policies again work
fine.
The problem is only, once again, with transitive dependencies.  I don't use
libtasn1-dev directly, it's merely required by one of libraries I'm using.
This one isn't a good example (399KB is negligible), but we have some
dependency chains from hell elsewhere.
Meow!
