It is a bit less than 1MiB saved on an AMD system when you purge
intel-microcode, but even that is likely to not be considered worth the
cost of the extra (empty) cpu-microcode-all package.
Besides, it is not like these packages waste valuable resources when
installed on a system they don't support, either: by default, once
installed, they detect the processor vendor and go inactive when it
doesn't match the one they are for.
That said, if anyone provides a compelling reason to switch to the
cpu-microcode-all + virtual cpu-microcode scheme (as in: give examples
of how the behavior changes on widely used package managers), and gets
the buy-in from the firmware-nonfree package, I will deploy it for
amd64-microcode and intel-microcode.
