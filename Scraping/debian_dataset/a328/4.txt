The change was trying to canonicalize two best practices in Policy: extra
documentation being at most Suggests, as you say, but also that even
primary documentation should not be a *Depends*, but at most a Recommends.
I think that's uncontroversial, and it sounds like people are still
comfortable with primary documentation being a Recommends (well, with the
exception of texlive, which came up in this thread -- that's a hard case
since it's documentation that would fit the definition of Recommends
normally, but it's quite large, and texlive gets pulled in a lot by build
dependencies).
