Using you script, it doesn't seem to be too bad. I went through a few 
machines:
I went through the ones on my desktop here (running testing). Excluding 
non-Debian packages, I found:
There are various packages that Recommends: their -doc packages; those 
probably sense if you've installed them directly, but are annoying when 
the package has come in as a dependency.
There are of course a bunch more unsatisfied recommends, but they don't 
strike me as weird (e.g., where I've elected not to install -i18n packages).
On a home server, running Jessieâ€”the script failed ("AttributeError: 
'Dependency' object has no attribute 'installed_target_versions'"). I 
don't know enough (any) Python to fix it.
On another desktop (at work) running testing (and ignoring ones already 
mentioned above):
hplip Recommends: sane-utils
   Printer is just a printer. Doesn't have a scanner.
libsane Recommends: sane-utils >= 1.0.25-4.1
   Don't have a scanner. (libsane is pulled some Depends). AFAIK -util
   is some programs to use SANE, not things called by the library.
openvpn Recommends: easy-rsa
   Unsure about this one. I have it a bunch of places, but the average
   person probably doesn't want to use the OpenSSL command line. Though
   certificate management is a once every X years problem, except on
   your CA.
