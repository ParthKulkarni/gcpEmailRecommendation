For the first part, it indeed varies by use case.  I don't recall ever using
an USB or SD attached storage for "data" in an Unix machine, yet I have two
SD readers, four cards and one USB stick on my desk right now despite having
cleaned the desk a few days ago.  It's just always a "disk" for some SoC
or bootable media (d-i, etc).
Some people may disagree.

I found a security hole in the vfat driver as an idiot kid ~20 years ago,
before I even started using Linux myself.  That particular filesystem is
simplicistic enough to _possibly_ be exploitable bug free by now, but as a
btrfs@vger regular, I hear about enough unintentional corruption caused
failures that I see no way the filesystem could be secured against a
malicious image without an extreme effort that would also destroy
performance.  And that's a maintained filesystem.  We do, in our default
kernel, ship drivers for so many obscure filesystems no one has used for
years that I'm 100% certain you can find an arbitrary code execution bug
triggerable by just mounting such an untrusted USB stick.
Meow!
