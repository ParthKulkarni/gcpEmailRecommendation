From now on, you may be more likely to get sound with pulseaudio than
without due to upstreams dropping support for Alsa. See for example
Firefox. And the trend will continue since it's easier to write stuff
for PulseAudio than for Alsa. Maybe it would be better to solve the
problem you have with PulseAudio instead of just ranting (the only bug I
have found you reported against pulseaudio [0] was left unanswered on
your side despite very clear instructions on what to provide to help).
