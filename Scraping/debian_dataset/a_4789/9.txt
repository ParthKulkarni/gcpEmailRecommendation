FTR, Holger is referring to packages which are built only on those
architectures (and that can't be built on amd64).

No. You just have to do a source only upload and let the auto-builder
take care of actually compiling the packages.
Use "debuild -S" or "gbp buildpackage -S" and upload the resulting
*_source.changes.
