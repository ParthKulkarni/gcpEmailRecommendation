I don't think this statement is really true.
What's recommended is that you do binary builds, before you upload,
using sbuild or pbuilder.
Since you're doing that anyway, --source-only-changes is a convenience
feature to avoid having to run another command to make the
_source.changes.  There's no advantage to using --source-only-changes
instead of plain `dpkg-buildpackage -S`.
(An alternative which also has no need for the running another command
to make the _source.changes is `dgit push-source`.)
