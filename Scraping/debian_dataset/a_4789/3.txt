I managed to build s390 or mips packages on my amd64 chroot with
$ sbuild --host=s390x -s -d unstable --source-only-changes --run-lintian
(the --host part being documented at https://wiki.debian.org/CrossCompiling).
And according to https://wiki.debian.org/SourceOnlyUpload
source-only uploads are recommended now and are recommended to be done with 
pbuilder or sbuild.
That procedere seems sensible at least for me.
Thanks
Holger
