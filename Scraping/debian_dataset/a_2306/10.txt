What I learned from the Alioth Sprint last weekend
is that DSA previously handed-out a new (test) machine easily.
New policy is handing-out machines for the stage after early tests.
Thing that I hope is that Alioth successors will have the various services
on separate machines. So that we have not again the situation when replacing
a Source Code Management system we also have to replace the machine
with all the -guest accounts.
Don't count on me for that. New tasks I volunteert for during
the Alioth replacement sprint are  listmaster and http://gitea.debian.net
maintenance. So most likely nothing new:  We all agree that someone else
should do it. And we all respect those who actually do.
