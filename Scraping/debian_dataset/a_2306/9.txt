Then someone has to go ahead and develop a complete usermangement for
sso.d.o. As it is we can't work with software that is maybe coming at some
point. Therefore we will start with gitlabs own user management, combined
with debians ldap.
But if you do take in point the following things:
- user self management (lost password, deletion)
- key self management
- api for user manipulation
- oauth2 frontend (sso as oauth2 provider)
- maybe saml frontend (sso as saml provider)
