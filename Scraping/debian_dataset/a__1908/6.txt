Could you please add something.
  To enable the migration even if either amd64 or i386 architecture
  is missing for one of the dependencies please
     [ ] file a bug against release.debian.org
     [ ] send an e-mail to debian-release.debian.org
(whatever might be prefered).
Thanks to all members of the release team
      Andreas.
