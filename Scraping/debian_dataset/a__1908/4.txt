With my bioinformatics hat on, I'd like to say thay actually in the case
of scientific tools, particularly when looking at newer sequence
analysis/search tools, i386 support can not always be assumed -- some
tools or libraries explicitly target 64-bit only, or use specific CPU
features of non-i386 archs. Bowtie, BWA, or Spades are examples, and
they have caused instances of the problem mentioned my Andreas before
[1,2,3].
It has to be noted that providing such acceleration can be a major
reason for these new tools to exist, and they are adopted as the basis
for other tools quickly.
Cheers
Sascha
