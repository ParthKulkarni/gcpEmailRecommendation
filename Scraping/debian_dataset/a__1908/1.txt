Indeed it happened already to you (or anyway, to -science and/or -med
packages)
It's not "not available on all architectures" but "not available on
amd64 and i386", and it's a detail configured in britney:

As usual, you will need to contact the release team and ask them to
force your package into testing.

Why mailing the release team asking for a one-shot 'force' hint would be
bad?
It has already been done multiple times without any complaintâ€¦
