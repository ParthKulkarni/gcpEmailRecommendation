Hi,
Thank you for your message and your help to improve the
patch towards the quality standard of Debian.
There are still some questions left on the best way to 
package a debian-port support in debootstrap.

I am afraid debootstrap already depends on perl (it
doesn't show up in the control file as perl-base
is Essential) : it ships a perl function 'pkg_details'
inline (see file /usr/share/debootstrap/functions line 1323
in debootstrap version 1.0.97)
There is no perl in debian-installer, and a C helper is 
provided by the udeb package 'bootstrap-base' as 
/usr/lib/debootstrap/pkgdetails (debootstrap-udeb is arch:all 
and bootstrap-base is arch:any)
I followed the same path to add a debian-ports support. Surely, 
the perl code would greatly benefit from the eye of a perl 
specialist (I am not).
As far as I know, there is no C implementation of sort_pkgs
packaged in debian-installer yet (for an example of what I
have in mind, see 
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=885878#44
deduplicate from Colin Watson 
https://launchpadlibrarian.net/14818796/234486.diff
seems to have a similar purpose - I haven't tested it yet)
Should the perl code depends on libdpkg-perl or is it bearable
to inline the needed functions ? The former avoids code duplication
with benefits in size and maintainability, the latter keeps the
dependencies to a minimum (wget, perl-base).
As far as I know, there are three main use cases of debootstrap :
1. create a debian chroot on a host running debian (or similar)
2. in debian-installer (base-installer step)
3. "to install Debian GNU/Linux from a Unix/Linux system"
(https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/apds03.html.en)
Depending on libdpkg-perl is beneficial to the first use case,
and inlining the functions to the third.

May I ask what for new features you have in mind ?

Is the hope of a debian-ports support in debootstrap still
(not too un)reasonable ?
