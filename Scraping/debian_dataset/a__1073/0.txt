Ok, I missed this. Still I'm pretty sure that it's not a good
trend to continue.

A dependency on libdpkg-perl is not a good idea either. This is why I'm
really questioning the need to for this code to be inside debootstrap
at all.

Possibly passing a pre-built "Packages" file directly. It would be the
result of the merge that you are doing between UNRELEASED and the normal
suite.

Why aren't you creating a proper suite merging the required bits on the
server side in ports.debian.org?
Maybe the tools you are using do not make it easy to implement but it's really
something that is not hard with most of the tools (e.g. reprepro).
