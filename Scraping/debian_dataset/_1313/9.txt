I did not say I wanted to require it. I just wanted to make sure it's
started before the MTA if there is one on the system. 
As a matter of fact I haven't had time to really debug the problem, a
first glance just showed me that on SysV system it always starts
earlier and never had a problem but since I added a native service file
it doesn't work anymore. This made me wonder if I missed any
dependency.
So again, not absolutely sure if it helps, but I don't understand why
defining a sequence like this would be harmful.
