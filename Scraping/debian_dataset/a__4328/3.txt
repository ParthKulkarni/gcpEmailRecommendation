Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.67
I run an automated test system.  Recently we had a test fail, because
an invocation of "xt-install-image" from the xen-tools package failed.
xt-install-image printed this:
 Installation method: debootstrap
 Running command 'xt-install-image --hostname=debian.guest.osstest
 --location=/tmp/enTikPkbpQ --dist=jessie --install-method=debootstrap
 --mirror=http://ftp.debian.org/debian --cache=yes
 --cachedir=/var/cache/apt/archives/ --arch=armhf 2>&1' failed with
 exit code 32512.
 Aborting
 See /var/log/xen-tools/debian.guest.osstest.log for details
In that logfile (which was nominated by xt-install-image) there is only
this:
 I: Retrieving Release
 I: Retrieving Release.gpg
 I: Checking Release signature
 I: Valid Release signature (key id 75DDC3C4A499F1A18CB5F3C8CBF8D6FD518E17E1)
 I: Retrieving Packages
 I: Retrieving Packages
 E: Couldn't download dists/jessie/main/binary-armhf/Packages
 Running command '/usr/sbin/debootstrap  --arch armhf jessie
 /tmp/enTikPkbpQ http://ftp.debian.org/debian 2>&1' failed with exit
 code 256.
I think the final message was printed by xt-install-image, and the
previous messages by debootstrap.
My complaint is about this message:
  E: Couldn't download dists/jessie/main/binary-armhf/Packages
I would like to know:
 * What URL (or other downlaod technique) was being used
 * What IPv4 or IPv6 address was being communicated with
 * Whether the error was due to
    - a corrupted file
        and if so please state the location of the corrupted
        copy and the expected checksum so that the corrupted
        file can be inspected to see what is wrong 
    - an http error response
        and if so please print at least the HTTP status line
        and ideally log the error document somewhere
    - an http protocol violation
        and if so a description of what the violation was
    - a networking system call failure
        and if so which system call
        and what the errno value was
    - something else
        including appropriate details
Thanks,
Ian.
