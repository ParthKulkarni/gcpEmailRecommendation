I've definitely choosen a very bad time to claim e-mail the most
reliable way of conversation.  ;-)  But Lumins argument of mailing list
archives is a good point.
In general I need to admit that in the now close to 20 years I have
upload permissions the overall happiness about ftpmaster processing is
mostly increasing over time.  We had some very bad times when only a
single person was caring.  Since this bottleneck was solved it became
dramatically better.  There are surely times when the queue fills up but
if you give good reasons for ftpmasters why a specific package is more
important than others (like this package helps fixing RC bug #xy) or so
this is very promptly processed.
To repeat myself: Cudos to ftpmaster
     Andreas.
