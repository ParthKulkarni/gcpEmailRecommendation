The 2010[1] and 2017[2] call for help both said that one needs to be a
DD, unless one is solely helping with dak (which is not ftpassistant).
It is hard to justify granting NEW reviewer bits if one does not already
have unrestricted upload to the archive.

I reviewed the relevant conversation in #debian-ftp. I think if you
re-read it, the context makes it pretty clear that it was certainly not
"laughing off the request" â€” you said something along the lines of "my
destiny is sealed" and the response was, jokingly, you could be freed
from that destiny by a rejection. [Then again, the conversation was in a
language I do not speak, so maybe there's nuance that did not translate.]
I can assure you that your request to join was not silently declined,
and has yet to be processed due to lack of time. We have onboarded
several FTP trainees since the August 2017 call, but they are generally
done in batches.
Cheers,
Luke
