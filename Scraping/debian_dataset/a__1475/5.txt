Unfortunately, I have basically zero knowledge about Rails, JavaScript
and Node.js: I could not be of much help in packaging GitLab.
What I meant was that the time that will be spent in manually installing,
manually adapting, and manually upgrading the upstream version, would
perhaps be better spent in helping the maintainers to keep the Debian
package up-to-date and in using the Debian package in stead of the upstream
version...
