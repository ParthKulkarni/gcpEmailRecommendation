Package: general
Severity: grave
Justification: causes non-serious data loss
Dear Maintainer,
on Lenovo laptop ideapad 520 Gnome randomly crash and, after some seconds of
text, the system ask me to login to gnome, as if I had access to it during
boot.
All the opened software and data is gone.
It happens 1 to 4 times a day.
I have consulted the syslog, kern, Xorg but I can't find any hints on the
package is causing the error.
The laptop harware is:
        Intel® Core™ i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz × 8
and double graphic card:
        VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620 (Kabylake
GT2)(rev 07)
        Subsystem: Lenovo UHD Graphics 620
        Kernel driver in use: i915
        3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP108M [GeForce MX150] (rev ff)
        Kernel modules: nvidia
The system is Debian GNU/Linux buster/sid 64 bit using bumblebee and Nvidia
driver Version: 390.48.
Thank you,
Riccardo
