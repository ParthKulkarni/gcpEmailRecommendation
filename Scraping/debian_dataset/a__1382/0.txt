Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.67+deb8u1
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
   * What led up to the situation?
     running rootstrap to create a devuan filesystem.
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
     ran rootstrap.  It failed; with an error message from these lines
if [ ! -e "$SCRIPT" ]; then
        error 1 NOSCRIPT "No such script: %s" "$SCRIPT"
fi
   * What was the outcome of this action?
   rootstrap failed.
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
   rootstrap to succeed.
