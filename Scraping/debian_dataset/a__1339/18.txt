While I stick to Iceweasel, this isn't anywhere as visible for Icedove so
I'll grudgingly accept this one. :Ã¾

I see no deletion step.  This is bad for a couple of reasons:
* my .icedove takes north of 2GB (mostly imap cache of multiple servers),
  one of my users clocks above 7GB for a single server
* if you have some sensitive mail and delete it, you really don't want a
  copy to stick forever.  Especially if you then go through a border...
Meow!
