I think he's talking about RIPA, in which case:
  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/53#commentary-c19929351
  Section 5A:   up to 5 years for national security cases (which is pretty much
  anything these days it seems) or 2 years max otherwise.
The "tipping-off" stuff is lovely too:
  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/54
I guess one might end up needing a lawyer to know if revoking one's
compromised keys is something that will also get you a 5 year sabbatical.
Cheers, Phil.
