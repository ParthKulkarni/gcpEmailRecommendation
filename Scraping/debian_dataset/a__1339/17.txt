I have yet to see a multi-gigabyte single MP3 file.  If you insist on this
extra backup, you could at least delete the IMAP cache -- for an IMAP-only
user this might indeed reduce the profile to something small.  For POP and
locally saved mails, though, this still wouldn't help.
Leaving an unknown to the user copy of mails is a major security hole, as
this is precisely the kind of data criminals[1] at the border are looking
for.  Following good general practice and having the disk encrypted is of no
help as they force you to enter your password, often with multi-year jail
time (UK) if you fail to comply.  Thus, data the user believes to be purged
must be actually purged, no hidden backups "just in case".
What about this: in your startup wrapper, check if
~/.icedove_moved_by_thunderbird_starter is present.  If it is, display a
nagging popup asking the user to verify if their mails are still present,
and if so, delete the directory.  This would fix both gigabytes of junk and
the privacy hole.
Or perhaps, just rename the directory silently.  That would bring no less
safety than previous upgrades that reused the directory name.
Or possibly make a symlink instead.
Meow!
