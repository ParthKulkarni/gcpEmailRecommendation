Sorry, I don't get your point:
the CD faq your mention above contains exactly the same
recommendations like we have NOW in the installation-guide:
it has recommendations for Linux machines, and for Windows 
it recommends win32diskimager.
So, if you say that the CD faq is ok, we can leave everything as it is
and we are done.
But - wait: you also say, that recommending third-party tools
is not good, so you should also prompt to change the CD faq!
If you point first-time Debian users to the CD faq, it is also
an official document/manual, and so it should honor
the same rules as the installation-guide, IMO.
However, you promote the CD faq as a good example...
So I don't get your point ...
Long story short: recommending a second (good) tool, is IMO
an improvement (at least in the light of user reports, which claim
about win32diskimager not being usable under Windows 10).
