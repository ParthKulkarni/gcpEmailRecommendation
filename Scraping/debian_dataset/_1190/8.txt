Why should we only include that information?  There is other
information that is neither, but where it's clearly useful to version it
together with the rest of the package, such as the changelog or the
description.  Or, you know, the Standards-Version for the reasons
described elsethread.
Also, the Standards-Version header is only recommended to be included,
it's not mandatory.  If its existence offends you so much and you have
so few bugs to fix in your packages that the primary effort of
maintaining your package is updating the Standards-Version header then
just don't include it?
