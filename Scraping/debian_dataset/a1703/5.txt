gcc people simply broke ABI just because they could. There were other ways
to accomodate SSE alignment restrictions, such as aligning stack
only in functions which spill vector temporaries to stack,
but gcc chose a disruptive one.
The breakage appears *now* because SSE vector usage inside glibc is increasing.
If your libc is careful to not use SSE needlessly, it would work fine.
As to how to fix this for busybox, let's have a config option to disable it.
