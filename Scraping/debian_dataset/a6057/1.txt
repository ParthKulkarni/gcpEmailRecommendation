We are seeing this issue on sparc64 now as well when using a serial
console for the installation. Using the arrow keys in the serial
console leads to random key presses (not sure whether it's <ESC>
or <RETURN> here), it did work fine in the past.
The images built in May, 2016 work fine:

The images built in March, 2017, don't:

Please note that we have to set TERM=linux on the kernel command
line to get a usable serial console at all. Without setting TERM
to "linux", the text is all garbage. I will file a separate bug
for that.
My suspicion is that both issues are related to Roger's patch
to add GNU screen support in debian-installer. We have a sparc64
porterbox available which Roger - or anyone who would like to
work on this - can use for test installations (a different
one than notker.debian.net which is just for general porter
work).
Thanks,
Adrian
