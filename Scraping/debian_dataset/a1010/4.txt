We also have to consider embedded devices. I was told there are small
embedded devices with really slow connections around that run debian
and automatically update using apt - we don't want those to have to
keep around old packages either.
And quite practically speaking, I do not want to keep around packages
on my system, but I do want deltas, because at 10 Mbit/s, it's a pain
to upgrade. I also want to keep my /var small, so I have actually usable
space rather than duplicate of files.
But since deltas require implementation in dpkg, it's not my
decision anyway, it's guillem's. I'm just proposing ideas that
seem reasonable.
