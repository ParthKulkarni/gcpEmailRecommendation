I would say it depends on the software. Some differs more than other.

and bsdfiff of old data.tar vs new data.dat 2.3MiB which is probably
what debdelta does. So I am not sure if it is worth the extra mile to
diff file by file. It might be faster and less memory hungry however.

There is deltarpm [0] which does the same thing for rpm/fedora. I tried
to find a design document but it seems that there is none. It seems
however they grab all the binaries and make a delta via in-tree copy of
bsdiff (delta.c). They also have intree-zlib but I didn't look whyâ€¦
I was mostly interrested if they have some filters to replace the
offsets in binaries with something else but didn't find anything yet.
I am not sure if they keep old rpm around for the delta to apply or if
they reconstruct if from the file system (minus the config files).
