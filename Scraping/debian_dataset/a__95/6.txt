Hi Simon,

Yes and no. While it brings application indicators back to GNOMEv3  
(what we do for GTK-3 applications with libayatana-appindicator), it  
does not show system indicators icons' at all. This is non-problematic  
for GNOME because the model for user interaction with the system  
controls has been re-done in GNOMEv3 with a different concept.
Yes, absolutely! And, it allows one to have more fiddly widgets in  
those system tray menus then, too (like sliders, calendars, switches,  
etc.).
Oh, please keep that maintained. While AppIndicator is already widely  
spread, there are still many applications or even widget tool kits out  
there, that only have xembed support (e.g. wxWidgets afaik). Dropping  
xembed support from GNOMEv3 would be painful to users of these  
applications.
We have a ayatana-indicator-systemtray in prep that catches such  
xembed applications and proxies them trough to an indicator renderer.  
However, ayatana-indicator-systemtray will be a system indicator (not  
an application indicator, thus not using SNI). For GNOMEv3 this means,  
it won't be available there.
This xembed to SNI (StatusNotifier DBus Interface, also termed  
AppIndicator) is a slightly different cup of tea than the above  
addressed transition from Ubuntu Indicators to Ayatana Indicators.  
However, it is a highly valid one. But it requires application  
developers to reimplement their code based on xembed and switch to an  
SNI capable approach (where Ayatana AppIndicator is just one of them,  
the Qt5 people have their own approach for that).
