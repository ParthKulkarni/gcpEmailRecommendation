Hi Ian,

The fancy widgets (sliders, etc.) for now appear in _system_  
indicators, only. They are special indicators in MATE, XFCE  
(optionally), possibly Budgie (optionally), that have a special  
rendering and don't use the StatusNotifierItem implementation. (And  
they don't work, yet, on Debian, only on Ubuntu, because they require  
some Ubuntu'ish GTK-3 patch).
The AppIndicator based applications only use menu items (widgets) that  
have been used in Xembed based systray menus, so far.
tk-tktray is an API for Xembed'ding a systray icon. This will continue  
to work, as long as a desktop env provides Xembed support. However, I  
wouldn't code new projects based on tk-tkray.
Some weeks ago, I uploaded the vala-panel package to unstable. It  
supports AppIndicators and Xembed based applications alike. It could  
well need some more testers and feedback. However, it is a promising  
project esp. for people that don't want to use a specific desktop env  
but rather assemble their own working environment.
I am not sure, I am fully getting the application design, you have in  
mind here. Do you mean X-embedding (this is about icons and systray  
and the icons have menus and submenus) or reparenting? With X11  
reparenting you can reparent X11 application 1 into X11 application 2.  
(xterm has it even as cmdline option).
It is because AppIndicator does not do X-embedding at all. And for  
X-embedding, you merely new some libX11 calls. AppIndicator / SNI is  
about an application (written in GTK, Qt, what-not) sending its menu  
tree and systray icon over DBus and on the other end a desktop env  
applet (renderer) that pumps this menu structure into the panel (your  
elsewhere appropriate).

I you have more question, please ask. Thanks for the discussion!
