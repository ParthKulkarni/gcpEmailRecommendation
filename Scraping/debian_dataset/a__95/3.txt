That sounds interesting. I maintain openpgp-applet [0] (both upstream
and in debian, which is in perl / gtk3 and currently uses the old
fashion systray.
However, I did a quick search, and I couldn't find the bindings for perl
you speak about, be it on CPAN or Launchpad. I probably missed it,
could you share a link ?

I remember reading somewhere that a limitation is that you can only use
one type of click (no way to behave differently on right-click /
left-click), so I guess in some cases the switch means also a new UI,
right ?
