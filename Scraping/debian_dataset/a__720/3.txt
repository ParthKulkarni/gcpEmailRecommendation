Package: installation-guide-amd64
Severity: normal
Hello
I recently installed form scratch a Stretch to an old computer using an USB
stick.
The "boot menu" show and I hit enter for "Graphical Install". And then I
though it crashed. Twice. The keys don't make the menu move. Caps lock key
doesn't work.
It actually took 2'10" to show next menu "Select a language".
I believe section "5.1.1 Booting from USB Memory Stick" should warn
about possible big delays.
