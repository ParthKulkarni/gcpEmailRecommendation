I have never seen a machine with only 1.0 USB that could boot from USB.
I don't think the concept of booting from USB existed until we had USB 2.
It was just too slow to comprehend trying.
And how could a 64bit machine have only USB 1.0?  Not a chance.
Now if the USB key happens to be a Kingston Datatraveller G3 like the
one on my desk, then I can believe it taking forever and crashing.
That thing is an unreliable piece of crap that somehow claims to be USB3.
