I haven't been able to process all the thingsÂ©Â®â„¢ before this week, but
hopefully only the release announcement needs building; I haven't been
able to test built images yet though. Current time table is testing ||
writing this wednesday, and releasing the udeb block afterwards.
Sorry for the delay.
(For context: https://tails.boum.org/news/version_3.11/ needs to be
released on a tight schedule, so it took priority on Mon-Tue.)
