If that ever ends up happening in practice, then the person who is the
victim of that problem can simply send a signed email saying "the
previous unsigned email that claimed I didn't want to be a DD anymore
was a forgery".
Meanwhile, it makes sense to be courteous to people who were a DD once
but really couldn't care less now and want to get rid of the nagging,
which seems like a far more likely scenario.
