Yeah... you walk out without a word, and are upset if people still care
about you?  MW acted like an ass here.

That's expected.  The work of a mortician (MIA is basically this) is
unpleasant, and having people lash at you just for doing it is the norm
rather than an exception.
I see no way to make Mattia's work safe from being yelled at.  Anything we
say here won't get to people MIA interacts with, and if any of us gets
MIA-but-alive, we'd long since forgotten how we're supposed to behave
(as apparently customs are different at wherever MW worked at these years).
So I hope you'll grit your teeth and keep going.  You may end up as grumpy
as formorer -- but, notably, he still hasn't stopped his thankless unpaid
work.  Yes, every time you contact him about a list issue you get a reply
in a tone so uncheery it can sour the milk in a cow, but what's admirable
is that he _keeps getting shit done_.
So in the interest of Debian, we need to keep Mattia, formorer and other
folks in such roles well stocked in DebConf beer, encouraging platitudes
and so on... :)
Meow!
