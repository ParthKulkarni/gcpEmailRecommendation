I don't object to the principle (although I'm also perfectly happy
with the status quo), but could I ask for every two years?
Yes a yearly ping is not a big deal, but multiplied by the number of
organisations one is a member of, such annual makework is quite
tiresome, and years go surprisingly quickly once you are over about
35. A bit less often than that will be better IMHO.
