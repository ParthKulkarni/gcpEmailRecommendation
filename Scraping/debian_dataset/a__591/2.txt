Thanks for your work.
The commit was fine, the new files are used now.
But let me give one hint:
your files have the formatting changed, it has the whole content of the 
msgid and msgstr in one line (no matter how long the content is). That makes
partly very long lines.
Maybe you are not aware of this; when you edit the file with poedit, you see
no difference no matter what formatting is used. I would then be just a 
setting in poedit.
It is not really a problem, we have a script running daily, which will correct
this today in the evenning.
The only point is: when someone wants to use the diff, for example at
https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/d-i/trunk/packages/po/sublevel1/tg.po?r1=71001&r2=71000&pathrev=71001
(maybe because he wants to review the changings), that's nearly impossible,
since the diff is so heavily big, because many lines are shown as changed,
however the content did not change, only the formatting.
So, maybe you have a good reason to do it this way, then it would be your
choice to do it as you like.
But if there is no real reason, it would probably worse to change this
behaviour.
Nevertheless, thanks for your translation :-)
Regards
Holger
