Dear Holger,
Thank you so much for the details. And it is also nice to hear that Tajik
language is not among new languages anymore for Debian ).
Due to ongoing Tajik language reforms and improvements, It may take a long
time, but I do pass Tajik translations for Debian installer through the
government linguistics expertise to make sure that everything is in
compliance with new language laws, regulations and terminology control. The
procedure is not quick, but since there are no deadlines, so there is
nothing to worry about, as it may take months or more. After that procedure
Debian can be considered as validated product regarding the Tajik
translations and ready-to-use on the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan
as fully localized. I keep records on this process and will reflect them in
my scientific research work. Hope in the future this work can be found as a
useful experience for any localization projects, both commercial and
non-commercial. I expect that verified terminology and translated strings
will also become available on the official website of local language
authority organization to grow an official English to Tajik IT dictionary.
Kind regards,
Victor

"Done" is not something negative (even it sounds like this).
It means, adding Tajik to the debian-installer as a new language is
completed. 
When a translator comes up and says "I want to provide translation for the
installer into the <xyz> language", while xyz is not included in the
installer at all at that time (you can say: starting a new translation from
scratch), then Christian used to start what was called the "New Language
Process" (NLP).
This is documented here:
https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/doc/i18n/ch03.html
The NLP for Tajik has happened in 2013, but it has forgotten be completed
somehow, which is now done.
> How the language is supported after the "NLP - Done" status?
As all the other languages, translators are encouraged to keep their
translation up-to-date, which you are working on.
BTW: there are some more sublevels to complete ;-))) And translation is
included is in the installer, that's it :-)
Cheers
Holger
