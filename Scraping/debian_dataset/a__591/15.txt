Since we got a translation update for Tajik, and Victor is working to get
it to 100% for level 1, we can assume, that this language is no longer 
"prospective", right ? :-)
Status of Tajik at
https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/doc/i18n/languages.html
is currently "tools".
It seems the New Language Process for Tajik is stalled somehow, so I would
like to get it finished now (only a theoretical part though, since Tajik is 
nearly active in d-i).
Info on this process is at https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/doc/i18n/ch03.html.
In another mail Victor has shown, that he is capable of using tools for
po files, he even managed to merge several po files into one big project
and the like. So I think nlp_step 'tools' is done.
The next step would be to ask Victor to subscribe to mailinglist
<debian-i18n@lists.debian.org>. 
Victor: if not already done, could you please subscribe to this mailinglist,
so that we can reach you easily, in case this is needed? 
After that, the last steps would be:
"Announcement of the translation effort", which could be done with this mail:
Hey guys, Tajik translation for debian-installer is nearly complete, just
for your information. :-)
... and "Follow the Debian Installer development", which is also nearly
done, looking at the translation status.
So, any objection for me setting Tajik NLP status to 'done'?
Regards
Holger
