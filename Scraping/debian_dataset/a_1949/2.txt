thanks for your mail and many thanks for wanting to improve Debian!
We have mentors.debian.net to help von someone wants to
package something for Debian. There is also documentation there.
I suggest starting to read here:
https://mentors.debian.net/intro-maintainers and maybe the QA
https://mentors.debian.net/qa and https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsFaq
You can ask questions on the debian-mentors mailing list [1] or on IRC,
#debian-mentors on OFTC.
[1] https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/ 
I hope the above information helps to get you started.
If not, please feel free to post to the mentors mailing list (I'm also
active there.)
