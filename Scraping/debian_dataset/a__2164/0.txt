Not necessarily, see for example /target in d-i when the machine has
been booted from other media than the target disk.
As noted in my initial message, d-i does not handle this in all cases,
requiring clumsy warnings on wiki pages to warn the user about its
deficiencies. If flash-kernel provided a way to do it, d-i could easily
to it for at least cases where u-boot is installed on a safe media like
a SD card.

A separate program included in flash-kernel that looks at the machine
database to determine how to install u-boot and installs it to a
specified device would avoid all of those issues.
That is what I am suggesting.
