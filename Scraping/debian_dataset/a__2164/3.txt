Hello,
maybe we are misunderstanding each other: it doesn't matter to
which medium/partition d-i installs Debian.  To actually start
d-i on the device, u-boot has to already have been put onto the
device (device as in "computer", not as in "/dev/sdxy")
beforehand by some means, otherwise you couldn't have started d-i
in the first place.

Again, at the point in time where d-i (which then runs
flash-kernel) is executed, there already is (i.e. has to
be) a u-boot on the device, otherwise d-i couldn't be running on
it.  This isn't anything that d-i could change without a
time-machine ;-).
The only case where d-i could reasonably handle u-boot
installation is installing an additional u-boot instance to
_another_ storage location than the one that the system has
already been brought up from, e.g. for the case where u-boot has
been loaded from SD card initially, d-i installs Debian onto a
harddisk, the SD card slot shall be used otherwise and the system
has another possible location for u-boot besides the SD card,
like eMMC or SPI flash.  That's exactly the case that I had been
targeting with the u-boot-installer udeb mentioned in my previous
post, but again this isn't a job for flash-kernel but for a
separate tool.  This tool may well use flash-kernel's hardware
database, but it doesn't make sense to integrate this
functionality into flash-kernel.  Flash-kernel is designed to be
automatically run via callbacks without any user interaction, and
installing u-boot under these preconditions simply isn't possible
as I have laid out in my previous mail.

Ok, so we actually aren't talking about flash-kernel here but
about a new separate tool that just happens to live in the
flash-kernel package?
