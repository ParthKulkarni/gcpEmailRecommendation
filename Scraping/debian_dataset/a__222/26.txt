Personally, I think this general direction has so much potential that
it might even become so good that I would use it for packages for
which I am myself the upstream.
For now, though, the right next step is to probably have a general
purpose automatic thing running on DSA infrastructure, with enough
compartmentalisation between different packages that it doesn't have
to trust them all.
As for automatically uploading to Debian: we already have the right
technical infrastructure in the core parts of the project.  It's very
simple, conceptually: we make a trusted "approval" machine which:
  verifies upstream signatures and source code operations, based on
  information in the existing version of teh package in sid
  automatically makes a signature on the source-only upload
  using its own gpg key
  does dput
And the upload goes through because
  the auto-puller's gpg key is in the DM keyring
  the auto-puller's service name and email address
  is in the Uploaders for the package
  the package has DM uploads enabled
Oh, I have one more wishlist item: pls make it use dgit for its
uploads kthxbye.
Ian.
