Thank you tons for all your nice and constructive ideas, experiences and
comments.
My (biased) impression is that there is a majority in favour of some
automation to become an option for routine package maintenance. We just
do not know how this should look. But we do know that this is dangerous
to have and by no means applicable to packages of all sorts and the
maintainer and the maintainer's responsibilities shall not be circumvented.
I do not know how to best proceed. Shall we collect more emails for a
week and I (or preferably some less biased observer) then summarise(s)?
If the positive vibes I have felt are kept up then I propose the
individuals running relevant services in/around Debian (ftpmasters, web,
backports, mentors, ...) determine what team then takes that summary to
transform it into a white paper that proposes steps to address so we
eventually have something to have a vote about?!
Best,
Steffen
