As someone who seems to constantly be looking for software to do
things that everyone else evidently seems to think obscure, I don't
agree.
I would much rather have a minimally maintained package, from Debian,
in my stable release, than have to roll my own.  This is particularly
true if I don't know yet whether the thing is what I want.  Trying
something out from "apt-get" in stretch is a lot less work and a lot
less risky than git cloning some random url and then blundering about
trying to get the thing going.
I prefer this so much that in some cases I have considered packaging
the thing myself and becoming one of these "disgrace" maintainers that
Adrian is complaining about.
If I find some undermaintained package in Debian, it nearly always
works well enough to solve my problem.  And if it doesn't I have a
uniform way to find the source, somewhere to send my packaging bug
report, and the opportunity to NMU it if I discover something
sufficiently bad.
Ian.
