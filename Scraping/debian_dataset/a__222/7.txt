There is an interesting social dimension to the scrutiny by a human
maintainer.  Debian package maintainers rarely review in detail the full
diffs between upstream releases, relying instead on trust relationships
that exist with upstream maintainers.  However, I suspect that those
trust relationships are supported in turn by the knowledge that the
Debian maintainer /could/ review the full diff, or do a partial review.
If an upstream author knows their code will go straight into an active
Debian suite when they push a git tag to GitHub, the trust dynamic is
changed, I think for the worse.

This seems much riskier, because we're talking about packages that get
installed on stable systems, which are more likely to be doing
security-sensitive work (I know that we don't give the same guarantees
for stable+backports that we do for stable, but the point remains).
