There are certainly problems with assigning the correct
semver-compatible version number in some environments, as you point out.
That's also part of why there are multiple revisions of semver itself, I
would assume.
However, those are upstream's problems, not ours; and given that
upstream tries to do the right thing, we can infer from a version number
which changes are expected, and whether it's a good idea.  I could
imagine a policy which would do something along the following lines,
given a X.Y.Z semver-compatible version number:
- if X changes, automatically file a bug but don't do anything
- if Y changes, try to rebuild the package and run any tests (if
  available); post the result to the BTS, but don't upload.
- if Z changes, try to rebuild the package. If autopkgtests exist, run
  them; if they don't fail, upload. If no tests exist, build, but don't
  upload. If uploading, file an "automatic upload happened" bug in the
  BTS, marked release-critical, so that the package won't auto-migrate
  unless someone has at least tested the package in a real-world
  scenario.
There will still be risks; there are always risks. In this context, and
with that policy, however, I think that they are minimized and
acceptable.
(I could imagine that if the package was involved in a transition, the
release managers would also not like it if the package was
auto-uploaded; having the script that implements the above look at the
transitions configuration before trying any upload might be helpful to
avoid that)
