Maybe the locale is not set properly by some versions of getty? If bash 
is started in a non-UTF8 locale and some of the startup scripts of bash 
assigns an UTF-8 locale to the LANG variable, we can expect problems 
exactly like this.
Suppose that we have a working bash shell with UTF-8 console where ñ 
displays properly.  Then try this:
LANG=C bash # run a subshell in a non-UTF8 locale
If you press ñ, you will see (arg: 1).  The programs (including a 
subshell) also work incorrectly because the locale is not UTF8.
Now execute this:
LANG=..... (some UTF-8 locale)
Now, if you press ñ, you will see (arg: 1) like before.  The programs 
(including a subshell), however, will work correctly.
Now execute this:
export LANG
Now also ñ works correctly.
If you are sure that the problem does not come from the locale, another 
thing to check is to compare the output of
bind -v
bind -p
in bash where ñ works properly and in bash where ñ leads to (arg: 1).
Also make sure there are no files ~/.inutrc and the variable INPUTRC is 
unset.
