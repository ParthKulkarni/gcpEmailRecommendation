Hi,
The plan to provide a transitional service is still alive, but it has
been going slower than hoped. The technical solution is on its way but
we are also still sorting out the non-technical issues of how/if we can
migrate data and what consents/safeguards would be needed. This is in
progress.
The February date is indeed now very soon and it's unlikely we would
have this in place in time. However my understanding from the alioth
admins is that this wasn't a hard deadline and was proposed before there
was a suggestion to have a transitional service, so I hope that they
will be able to continue service until we are able to announce a
transition plan, at the latest by the end of April (when alioth
itself will be shut down).
Best,
Dominic.
