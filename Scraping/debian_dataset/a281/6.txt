It depends on your choice. But I would not recommend this. I would largely
prefer if teams relied on tracker.debian.org to get all the automated
mails, that way lists on lists.debian.org contain only generic
discussions.

Yes, you can put team+<team-slug>@tracker.debian.org in your Maintainers
fields.
eg. team+pkg-security@tracker.debian.org for https://tracker.debian.org/teams/pkg-security/
It's possible to use this right now (it will not generate any bounce) but
direct mails to those team addresses are not yet forwarded to team
members.
But all packages with such maintainer emails will automatically be added
to the list of packages maintained by the corresponding team and thus all
team subscribers on tracker.debian.org will automatically get the
associated mails (unless they muted the team).
Cheers,
