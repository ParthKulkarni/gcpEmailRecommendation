as I already said several times on several channels: now that there is
someone taking over list.a.d.o it is their job to define dates. The old dates
were proposals and noone (me included) cared enough to define something
fixed. 
But: I/we won't run alioth longer than the end of LTS. Around two weeks
before EOL I will start to archive all discontinued services and get alioth
into some read-only state.
