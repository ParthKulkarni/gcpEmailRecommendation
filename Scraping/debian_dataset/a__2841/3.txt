One can always use http://snapshot.debian.org/ as one's mirror and
specify a dated URL that matches the ISO's creation date.
Cheers, Phil.
P.S. I suppose we could build-in such a snapshot URL, as a fallback in
case mirrors have dropped the files we're after, but I think doing so is
asking for trouble.  It would be the sort of code that gets used rarely
enough to end up rotting, and would also have the potential to mask bugs
in the normal code path.  Generally, if you want to survive this, just
use a CD image that includes the matching modules.
