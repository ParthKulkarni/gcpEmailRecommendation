Another crazy idea then: have a way to specify where the "current" 
kernel .deb (for whatever kernel is in netboot.tar.gz) is via preseed or 
something?
Or keep a copy of the that .deb for a given netboot.tar.gz in the same 
dir (main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot?) or other known 
location on a mirror?
The reason I ask is because I have custom  grub menu configs that I 
don't want to constantly hand edit or patch on a cron job along with a 
cron to download the dailies... and then have no idea if the cron will 
do the right thing, or if the daily even works. I'd like a "known good" 
net boot install server for testing and this is making it difficult.
If you think this might be useful I'd be willing to help develop a patch 
and/or help test one.
Thanks for your time, as usual, Ben.
