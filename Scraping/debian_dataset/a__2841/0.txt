Well, no-one can give you that guarantee with testing (rather than 
stable, but even there you might need to re-download the installer). One 
way would be to mirror a snapshot of testing, get an installer to work 
with it and then let the install process upgrade everything 
post-install. There isn't necessarily a need to install the most current 
at all times.
Even if we'd leave the old kernel udebs in testing for a while, you'd 
still hit a point where we'd need to drop them and old installers would 
break.
So if you are serious about the "even works", which is also a function 
of the hardware you install on, then maybe you need to run your own 
installer qualification process once in a while.
Well, if you have ideas that work within the current framework, we can 
see about that. Thanks for the offer. :)
Kind regards
