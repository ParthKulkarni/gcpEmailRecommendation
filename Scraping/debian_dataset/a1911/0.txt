Package: task-desktop
Version: 3.48
Severity: normal
anacron was added to the desktop-task a long time ago.
The changelog doesn't mention why it was added, but I assume it was to
support systems which are not running 24/7 and to ensure that cron jobs
have a chance to run.
Nowadays, we have systemd .timer units, which handle this issue much
nicer. I checked a default desktop installation, and all important cron
jobs have a corresponding .timer unit.
It thus seems safe to drop anacron from task-desktop.
