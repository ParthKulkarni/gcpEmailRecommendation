If I could vote for which idea Debian mail admin time is dedicated
(which I cannot since Debian admins are volunteers and can choose what
to work on), I'd vote for better spam filtering on
@packages.debian.org and @alioth-lists.debian.net, probably using the
crossassassin mechanism that @lists.debian.org already uses.
