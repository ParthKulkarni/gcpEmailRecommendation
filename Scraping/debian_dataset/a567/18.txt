Such a system already exists, so it would presumably not have to be
built from scratch.

Systems that only allow mail to be sent when it is signed via OpenPGP
are usually much more limited in scope. The only ones I'm aware of are
changes@db.d.o for updating LDAP via OpenPGP-signed messages,
*-a@lists.d.o for restricting announcement lists to Debian members and
perhaps things like schleuder.

My suggestion was to combat brute-force attacks against SMTP auth
passwords leading to spammers sending mail from the debian.org MXen
and getting Debian banned from sending mail to most of the SMTP
servers on the Internet. This suggestion only improves a small part of
the existing discussion about domain-based email authentication.

Thanks for that data point.

We do not rely on passwords for uploading to the archive or logging
into debian.org machines with SSH and I think the same should apply to
as many debian.org authentication systems as possible. In 2018, it is
many years past time to stop using passwords in general (with
exceptions for things like local auth and local encryption).
