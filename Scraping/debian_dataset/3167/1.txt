At the same time gpg2 (and modern ssh implementations) can do gpg agent
forwarding, which is straight forward to setup, and I find to be a great
feature to use gpg in virtual machines, containers, remote hosts,
without having to fiddle with my private keys, and potentially to use
gpg tokens remotely (but I don't have one of those, thus I haven't tried
it yet).
Also, I have a few simple automated processes that use gpg to sign and
encrypt some messages (still using the gpg binary, without the gpgme
library), and the transition from gpg1 to gpg2 has been painless.
Although, I admit, those do not do anything fancy.
Cheers,
