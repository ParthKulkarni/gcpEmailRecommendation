That's very fine. :) I was more wondering about tips and tricks for the
actual migration; but apparently Steve is happy to help with setting
things up with packages, so I would only have to deal with adapting the
l10n commit robot for new URLs.
While I'm on that topic, short brain dump: I've created it already
(di-l10n-guest), pointing to a mail address of mine for the time being;
and I've requested access to the group.

Congratz. :)

Thanks for having shown interest and having set up a project so much in
advance, and sorry again for not having jumped on that train at the
timeâ€¦
