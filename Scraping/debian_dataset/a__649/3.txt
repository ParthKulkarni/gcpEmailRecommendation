That one should probably go away?
I've updated .mrconfig to point to the new location; I'll probably remove the
‚Äúdeleted = true‚Äù entries as they are for packages in the attic; and those are
doubly deprecated as they're going to be archived now anyway.
URLs on dillon (d-i.debian.org host) have been updated to point to salsa.
A key has been generated there specifically for salsa, ~/.gitconfig has been
updated to rewrite https into ssh to push using ssh, and I've set up a
di-l10n-guest account as previously on alioth. I'm told we could be using
deploy keys, but from a quick glance they seem to work on a project level
(rather than on the group leve), and I'm not toying with salsa's API right
away. Also, https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/Doc#Deployment_keys is in FIXME
mode. ;) If the di-l10n-guest account remains needed, we should adjust the
mail address from one of mine to something shared across several people (not
sure about using debian-boot@ for that‚Ä¶).
A manual l10n-sync script seems to be working just fine, given the log
and the commits popping up on IRC. The only issue seems to be this, which is
likely an issue with the package itself:
| Everything up-to-date
| - preseed
|   - Run debconf-updatepo... failed.
Migrating away from SVN is still an open task though.
Cheers,
