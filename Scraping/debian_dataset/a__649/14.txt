Well, I was going to do so only as far as my involvement goes. Since I'm
only really involved in busybox, I was looking at bootstrapping the team
and putting busybox there.
I don't want to barge in and push anyone else into things they may not
yet be ready for, so I was planning on leaving the rest to other people.

I don't mind d-i-team or installer-team or even debian-installer-team,
but the self-service interface always adds "-team" to the end. Not
having -team on the end presumably means asking the admin folks to do it
manually for us, so it's probably best avoided unless we really want to.

Indeed, non-DD accounts need to register at
https://signup.salsa.debian.org/ and then a DD needs to add them to the
relevant team/project with appropriate permissions.
