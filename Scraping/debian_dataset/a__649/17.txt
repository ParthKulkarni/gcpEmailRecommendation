On my side, well, I'm watching the Salsa train from the platform and I
have to admit that I'm not active at all in the Salsa move.
While I very well understand reasons behind Alioth's shutdown, it
breaks so many established workflows of mine that, since the beginning,
I decided that I would be a follower on that topic. I never wanted to
enter arguments on -devel about this, but I think this move is way too
disruptive, with regards of the *real* situation of manpower in Debian.
If I can adapt my workflows to changes needed by the move to Salsa,
then I'm fine with it, that's mostly how I  follow things.
As of now, I know that l10n workflows *will* be affected, that's obvious.
