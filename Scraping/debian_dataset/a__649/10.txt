Hi,

If you have time/motivation to explore salsa.debian.org for d-i things,
that's more than welcome!

Not from me.

Good question. d-i looks good to me, and would match the current group
on alioth. debian-boot is historical and I think we should keep only
the list named this way (along with IRC).

If possible, that would look good to me. Not sure about non-DD accounts
support though (I've had too little time to keep track of salsa things,
which seemed to be fast moving).
Not necessary for busybox AFAICT, but we'll need to have that later when
moving all repositories there: we need to have access for the l10n robot
(including write access), working from dillon.debian.org these days.

I'm not sure. ISTR having seen people mention on IRC that views weren't
too practical when projects are under the Debian umbrella, because
everything is listed altogether? Maybe a separate group would be best?
Thanks for leading the way!
Cheers,
