I've now migrated all 103(!) of the non-attic d-i repos across from
alioth to salsa, following the pattern
 https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/$REPO.git
   to
 https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/$REPO
In each case, the old alioth repo will now reject pushes. The new
repos are each set up to use KGB to announce changes in #debian-boot
as previously. I've not (yet) spent any time on updating all the
debian/control files to point at salsa, or updated mr configs or
anything else.
The repos involved are:
