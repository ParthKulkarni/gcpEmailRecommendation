Hi folks,
I think it would be helpful to start using Salsa for some of our repos.
I would like to move my personal busybox work-in-progress repo to Salsa;
I know nothing prevents me from doing that but it feels like everything
would be more joined-up if the main busybox repo was also in Salsa and
in a debian-boot team/group.
Does anyone have any objection if I create a d-i/boot team on Salsa?
What should it be called? Should its membership just be copied from the
Alioth team? Alternatively, would it be preferable to use the "Debian"
group given we have such a large membership anyway?
axhn: any objection to moving busybox into Salsa?
Cheers,
Chris
