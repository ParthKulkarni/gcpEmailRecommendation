No, that's not at all enough. It ends up creating two empty packages,
without any files in them.
One needs to actually install a library into the library udeb and
tools into tools-udeb.
Note for fbtrfs only library-udeb is needed.
Maybe https://patches.ubuntu.com/libz/libzstd/libzstd_1.3.5+dfsg-1ubuntu1.patch
is of help
Also do get it reviewed, as last time unwritten rules w.r.t. udebs got
enforced and above patch was rejected on ground of not strict enough
alternative shlibs deps generated.
Please figure out what's missing before uploading to avoid a reject again.
