It is a copy ? (and I suspect there is also a move to $HOME/.thunderbird)
If there is a copy (and not only a move), how do you handle (missing) disk
space?
  I saw lots of icedove installation with several tens of GiB of cached IMAP
mails. There won't necessarily be enough place to do a copy of such profiles
so the migration must handle correctly this possibility (if all the profile
is copied)
