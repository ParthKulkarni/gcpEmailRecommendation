Hi,I am trying to figure out if someone knows about the whereabouts of theDebian ACE packaging team. Johnny Willemsen contacted me because he hadproblems to get in touch with the ACE team[0]. He is part of the upstreamteam and is interested in getting the package in shape again. Itcurrently suffers from one RC bug (#853299).The members of ACE team are:- Thomas Girard <thomas.g.girard@free.fr>  last activity Nov 2015 (PGP upload)  Martin Borgert orphaned omnievents which they both co-maintained.- Pau Garcia i Quiles <pgquiles@gmail.com>  last activity Nov 2016 (PGP upload)- Marek Brudka <mbrudka@aster.pl>  last activity Oct 2010 (BTS)Does anyone have an idea about their current status?[0] http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-ace-devel/2017-June/003534.htmlSebastianPkg-ace-devel mailing listPkg-ace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.orghttp://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-ace-devel
