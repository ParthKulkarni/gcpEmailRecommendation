I think we might be overstating the value of the kind of improvements
that can be submitted with GitHub's web-based text editor.
Firstly, it is not clear to me how the barrier to getting involved with
more substantial bugs is affected by the fact that I can trivially
submit typo fixes.  What did you have in mind?
Secondly, I suspect that the feeling of being accepted might be
illusory.  Submitting typo fixes that don't require any review does not
help build any relationships.
I don't mean that these fixes have *no* value, of course.
