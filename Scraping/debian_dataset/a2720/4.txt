Package: installation-reports
Severity: important
After a fresh install of Debian Stretch 9.0.1 with any kind of cryptography applied to the hard drive, if the computer suddenly shuts down, then it will not boot up again, a lot of errors will appear when booting up and it will be impossible to access the system again. Logging in the terminal is impossible as well. This happens to every machine I tried installing Stretch with cryptography.
