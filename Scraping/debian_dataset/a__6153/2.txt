Nice idea, but it doesn't scale. Am I suppose to add all of the
(currently) 406 OpenStack maintained packages one by one, by hand? And
then upload 406 times just to change the maintainer field? Gregor just
pointed out the 3500 packages of the perl team. There will be others
(think: javascript/nodejs, python, etc.). Even worse: some packages
*will* be forgotten, and there *will* be bug reports that will go to
nowhere because the fields were not addressed.
I don't understand that there's no consensus we'd be collectively
wasting too much time doing this type of change, when it could simply be
addressed by keeping the current lists. This is a major disruption of
services that we're talking about here.
