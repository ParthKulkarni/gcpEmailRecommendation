The use of the temporary file is there to stop the repeated running of
dmraid, which was the sole purpose of the commit that introduced the
bug, so if one gets rid of that one might as well just revert that
commit.
I agree that there appears to be the potential for $device to match
inappropriately, but I'd need to know something about what dmraid
outputs in order to improve on the grep (I don't have a sataraid machine
to test it on).  Adding a -F option might be a good start.
Cheers, Phil.
