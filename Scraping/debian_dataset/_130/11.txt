So, I went through all reproducible build failures in unstable without
notes and added notes for differences caused by building in merged-/usr
vs non-merged-/usr packages.  Together with what other people tagged,
about 60 problems were found.  (The oldest rebuild result for unstable
is 17 days old, the merged-/usr variation was deployed before that[1].)

There might be some more that as diffoscope had problems or the diff was
too large for some packages (but I'll assume that in this case
merged-/usr is not the only problem the package had).
This should cover all packages that had no other problems and were
reproducible before, that is about 80% of the archive.
Assuming the rate is similar for packages which have other reproducible
build problems, I would expect 60 / 80*20 = 15 more problems.
I haven't looked at build failures, but I would expect these to be
usually not caused by merged-/usr.
So an estimated ~80 packages which might need adjustments for building
correctly in both merged-/usr and non-merged-/usr.  I guess less than
for the average new release of GCC ;-)
The problems are usually easy to fix by passing an explicit path the the
package's configure script at build time; of course there might be some
package where it is more complicated.
