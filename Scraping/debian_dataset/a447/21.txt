Not really. apt-utils includes three tools: apt-extracttemplates,
apt-ftparchive and apt-sortpkgs. The later two should be together and
the first one shouldn't even existâ€¦ it exists only temporary as
a stopgap as long as there is no dpkg tool (which would be the more
natural place for extracting files from a deb file)[0] for this task.
In other words: We realized only later that its existence is permantent,
like with all good temporary solutions.
Splitting packages now means that the split will reach effect at most in
bullseyeâ€¦ (buster needs at least a recommends for upgraders, likely
depends as there are tools like local-apt-repository depending on
apt-utils to get apt-ftparchive) that might be a bit too far off for
your case, especially as we haven't really gained anything by it. We
just (literally) moved the problem.
(The other aspects I will hopefully answer with another mail in the
gsoc/outreach subthread)
