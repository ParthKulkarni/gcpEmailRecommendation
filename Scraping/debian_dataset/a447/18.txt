The BDB-based backends are already deprecated upstream in favour of 
LMDB, so when the time comes I'm happy to forcibly migrate the remaining 
users on upgrade. At that point we can simply stop building the module, 
possibly even in the same version where we force the migration.
There are still a few cases where LMDB may not be entirely satisfactory: 
databases containing a lot of aliases, or workloads that happen to cause 
a lot of fragmentation in LMDB. LMDB 1.0/OpenLDAP 2.5 will have some 
improvements in these areas. (No ETA from upstream at this time.)
Hope this helps, or at least marks slapd as "minor" on your list.
