This does not sound like something that should be done soon.

The number of packages that use gzip as compressor if rebuilt should be 
pretty close to 0. We need gzip for compatibility with older packages,
but no replacement for it.

This sounds like a much less invasive change to me.
And it could already deliver benefits for buster if
someone would be willing to implement that.
And there's another potential low hanging fruit for buster:
xz decompression time is linear with the compressed size,
higher compression would bring both smaller packages and
faster decompression.
There are two downsides to switching xz compression from -6 to -9:[1]
1. higher compression time
This will increase build times.
If this turns out to be a problem, most of our biggest packages are the 
-dbgsym packages that could continue to use a lower compression if needed.
2. more memory usage for uncompression
64 MB memory usage can be a problem for some lower end machines.
One way to mitigate both downsides might be different default compression 
levels on different ports, the ports where something like faster setup
of cloud servers would matter are not the ports with slow buildds or
where 64 MB memory usage would matter much on any supported hardware.

[1] we are talking about perhaps 5-10% smaller packages and faster 
    decompression speed
