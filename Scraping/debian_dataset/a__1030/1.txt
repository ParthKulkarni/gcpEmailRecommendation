This means that we should be much slower to adopt new compression
schemes than projects where data compression is used for transport or
short-term storage.
I would say that a new compression scheme should be widely used for
several years before we would consider it for source package and at
least half a decade before we would adopt it for .debs.
I am also concerned that we are the target of an advocacy campaign.
