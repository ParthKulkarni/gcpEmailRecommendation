We only care about zstd at level 19 for dpkg and apt.

Our major use case is cloud initial setup, image building, CI, buildds, all
of which do not require any syncs, and can safely use eatmydata, for example;
hence the enormous speed up.
There's still a speed up with syncs, but it's less than 10% IIRC. This will
get faster over time as SSDs increase their IOPS.

this was backed out at guillem's request.
