Hi,
following mail from Kartik says, the screenshot from
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=911705#55
are all fine, while Noto Serif Gujarati is the best:

Hi,
Sorry for ignoring this long time and thanks a lot for your work on
this! I was suppose to reply this and then had to move home in hurry

You can go ahead with any of these. All seems working fine. However,
Noto Serif Gujarati seems the best.
Thanks again!

So, I sent a patch here, how to build an image with working Gujarati font.
It's only a workaround though, since the image size is increased massively
by this.
In case we want this solution to become permanent, Jonas volunteered to add
the needed font to fonts-noto-hinted-udeb (instead of the
fonts-noto-unhinted-udeb used in this patch).
Hint: fonts-noto-unhinted-udeb version 20181130-1 is needed for this patch
to work.
Holger
