Ah, sorry: Seems there is nothing wrong with your bug filing.
Instead, it seems the tracker interface skips that bug for some reason 
(perhaps treats udeb packages as irrelevant?):

Nope, it looks like you did a great job!
...uhm, except for contacting me privately now: Please move to discrete 
conversation only when there is need for discretion: Debian explicitly 
promise to not hide problems, so the (common for some) notion of "didn't 
want to bother others with this seemungly minor detail" does not apply.
Feel free to use your own judgement - but I recommend to at least notice 
prominently at top of your email when changing recipients in the middle 
of a conversation.
