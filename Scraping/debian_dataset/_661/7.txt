"Desired but not required for outbound connectivity" seems like exactly
the case for having an alternative means of specifying the proxy, such
as going back from the download screen, handling errors, and supporting
expert installs.

Fascinating.  I think we can only deal with network-specific brokenness
to a point; if we attempt to download from security and get through, we
could consider the network apparently working without a proxy.
(Debian really needs a canonical "connectivity-detection" page, similar
to Google's /generate_204 page.)
