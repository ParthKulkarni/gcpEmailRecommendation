Hmm, ok.
I was aware of that package being for powerpc, which is not a release-arch.
The upload is just for completeness - as for many other d-i packages, to update 
the alioth URLs in debian/control to Salsa:
yaboot-installer (1.1.40) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Team upload
  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Update Vcs-{Browser,Git} to point to salsa (alioth's replacement).

Which looked to me as a change of no harm.
But, no problem then, if that will be refused.
Thanks for noticing
Holger
