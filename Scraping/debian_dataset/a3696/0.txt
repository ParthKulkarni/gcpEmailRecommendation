No. I mean only what I wrote: debootstrap is currently only used for
chroots etc. where e.g. fstab doesn't even make sense.  The debian
installer then for instance has scripts to populate fstab & hosts
according to what it knows about the content that should be put.
Crosshurd (again, should be called crossdebian, it's not hurd-specific
at all), however, does know how to populate fstab & hosts with sample
files according to the system, and thus I think it answers the need
expressed here.
We could also see at merging deboostrap and crosshurd, since they
are two tools which do almost the same thing, and see crosshurd's
README.Debian suggesting so.

There is no reason to do it only for Linux.
