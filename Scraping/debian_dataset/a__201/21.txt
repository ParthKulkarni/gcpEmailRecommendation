Unfortunately, wrap-and-sort has its own way of sorting: special entries (i.e. 
that do not begin with letters) are sorted after "normal" entries. So 
dependencies like "${misc:Depends}" are sorted after package dependencies. 
Usually, sort algorithms do the reverse. May be wrap-and-sort should be called 
wrap-and-sort-ish :-p
I don't really mind this weird order except emulating this requires adding yet 
another special case (aka wart) to the way dpkg is handled in cme.
All the best
