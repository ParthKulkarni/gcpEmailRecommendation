Uh ? From a fresh git clone of beads, cat debian/copyright shows:

There's no main CeCILL section.
And cme complains:
$ cme check dpkg-copyright 
cme: using Dpkg::Copyright model
loading data
Configuration item 'Files:"*" License short_name' has a wrong value:
        license 'CeCILL' is not declared in main License section. Expected
Admitedly, the error message is lackluster when main License section is empty. 
This will be fixed.

Duh ;-)

I hope that won't be necessary. See below.

It's just that cme uses a diff to show the delta between old and new value. 
It's not supposed to be used as a patch. May be I should just display a 
"changed" message when summarising the changes applied to a text parameter.

So we have a common goal :)

I'm open to idea on how to improve the GUI while keeping it generic for the 
other models supported by cme (e.g ssh systemd itself ...)

Sorry, my bad. I dropped a '!' during cut'n'paste. 
Here's the right command tested on beads repo:
$ cme modify dpkg-copyright -force 'License:CeCILL text=.file(COPYING) ! 
Files:"*" License short_name=CeCILL ! Files:"debian/*" License 
short_name=CeCILL'

$ git diff --stat

It did so, but refused to write the output due to errors.

No problem. cme tries to address a very complicated problem and can be 
confusing when dealing with corner cases. 
Thanks for your patience and questions. This is invaluable to improve the 
usability of cme. :-)
All the best
