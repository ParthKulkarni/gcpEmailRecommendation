Sorry, I do not understand.  I the string CeCILL (with capital I) is in the
main license section.  Could you please be more verbose how d/copyright needs
to look like to make cme add the license text?

Likewise I fail to understand. ;-)

Yes please.  I'd be really happy if you could push a d/copyright that is
correctly formed to let cme work.

Not really - but it might be probably me. ;-)

I redirected simply for this mail here ...

Yes, I had this clue only since the first column '+' is a feature
frequently used in patch.  Just a wild guess of mine.

That's what I'd prefer.

I admit I do not really like that GUI.

$ cme modify dpkg-copyright -force 'License:CeCILL text=.file(COPYING) ! Files:"*" License short_name=CeCILL Files:"debian/*" License short_name=CeCILL'
cme: using Dpkg::Copyright model
Warning: Files:"*" License short_name skipping value CeCILL because of the following errors:
license 'CeCILL' is not declared in main License section. Expected 
Warning: Files:"debian/*" License short_name skipping value CeCILL because of the following errors:
license 'CeCILL' is not declared in main License section. Expected 
License CeCILL is not used in Files: section
object 'Files:"*" License' error: unknown element 'Files'. Either your file has an error or Dpkg::Copyright::FileLicense model is lagging behind. In the latter case, please submit a bug report using 'reportbug libconfig-model-dpkg-perl'. See cme man page for details.
        Expected elements: 'full_license','short_name'
Hmmm, sorry, no change to d/copyright.
 
> Hope this helps
No, sorry, I seem I totally fail to understand.  Why exactly can't cme
simply copy the text that is specified as CeCILL into my copyright?
Sorry for my probably very naive questions but obviously I do not
understand the philosphy behind.
Kind regards
         Andreas.
