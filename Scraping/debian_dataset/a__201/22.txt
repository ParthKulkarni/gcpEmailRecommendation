Not quite sure what you suggest.
It looks like you suggest to duplicate the work of SPDX - see e.g. 
https://github.com/spdx/license-list
I believe that in the long term such duplication of work is not helpful, 
and instead we should support SPDX in being the curators of a single 
canonical repository of common Free licensing patterns in active use.
That said, I do believe that short-term some degree of competition does 
help - when coordinated with SPDX.  Anyone interested in that please 
join the licenses-discuss mailinglist:
