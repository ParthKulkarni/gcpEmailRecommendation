In the Git repositories of packages that I maintain at alioth.d.o, a 
script [*] is called in the post-receive hook for tagging the bugs listed 
in the meta tag "Closes:" of gbp-dch as "pending".
Is there a way to have a similar integration service for the Git 
repositories at salsa.d.o?
Best,
Rafael
