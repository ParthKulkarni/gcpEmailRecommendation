  Description     : converts wildcard expressions to Perl regular expressions
(as created by dh-make-perl)
 In many situations, users may want to specify patterns to match but don't
 need the full power of regexps. Wildcards make one of those sets of
 simplified rules. Regexp::Wildcards converts wildcard expressions to Perl
 regular expressions, so that you can use them for matching.
 .
 It handles the * and ? jokers, as well as Unix bracketed alternatives {,},
 but also % and _ SQL wildcards. If required, it can also keep original (...)
 groups or ^ and $ anchors. Backspace (\) is used as an escape character.
 .
 Typesets that mimic the behaviour of Windows and Unix shells are also
 provided.
