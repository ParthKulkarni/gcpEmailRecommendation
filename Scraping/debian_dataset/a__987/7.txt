Done.
However, there is much more work to do here, "svn" and "alioth" is often 
mentioned in the manual.
That would need some more time (at least for me).
And:
maybe the workflow of xml-based translations is affected by git migration?
Tracking the up-to-date-status of those files is handled with svn revision
numbers, which are no longer available now IMHO.
How to deal with this?
Is it worse to overwork the relevant scripts, to make them work with git
hashes, or should we just drop xml-based translations altogether now?
Most translations have switched to po already, from the up-to-date
languages only Czech is left on xml.
Christian, any opinion on this?

I remembered some trouble with the debian-refcard, where the publication
on the debian.org website was affected, because the website directly uses
the latest uploaded package version.
But the installation-guide is handled differently here apparently, so
that's most probably not a problem here...
