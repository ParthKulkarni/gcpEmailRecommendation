Heya,

That's fair. But maybe we should track this as a different RC bug (just
to make extra sure this doesn't go unnoticed/unfixed until the release),
which could be closed later on?
Steve, do we have to have installation-guide in testing to build Alpha
or RC images?

I don't have stats handy, but if there's only Czech around, I think time
would be better spent moving it from xml to po? I suppose this is a
transition that had been underway for a while and was never completed?
I'm not sure whether we should work on porting any other xml-based
translations if there's nobody active on them?

â€¦ but I'm definitely happy to hear more about this from Christian or
others.
Again, I'm so sorry this is getting kind of forced onto us, but I don't
think it would have been reasonable to take responsibility for
maintaining an svn server forever anyway. :(

I think we've had fixes on the website generation framework to handle
that problem exactly. If we spot issues (again), we should work on
fixing them, rather than being limited in our upload capacity on the
installation guide side, I think?

We'll see. :)
