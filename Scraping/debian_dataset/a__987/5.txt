This is because of the "ID xxx-yyy already defined" validation errors",
which has already been reported in 
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=880210
and which was already fixed in svn repo (oh, this is now git).
Maybe we should do an upload to get this fixed in the archive?
However, that would be an upload for Buster (there's
"Bump release name to buster" in the changelog).
Hmm ...
Holger
