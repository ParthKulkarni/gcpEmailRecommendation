Hi,

Ah, this would explain. :)

I'm not convinced by this. There a quite a bunch of situations where
debootstrap is used to create a system that's not even supposed to be
booted from, so I guess having systemd do its automatic fixing of bits
if that's neededâ€¦ is just fine as-is. Even more so since we already have
appropriate instructions within debian-installer for setups where's a
system to be run is being installed.
