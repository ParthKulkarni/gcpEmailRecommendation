My error, sorry (but we still need to plan the gfortran-8 transition).
What happened here is that I moved the .mod file in libeccodes-dev to
/usr/include/$ARCH, to make the package multi-arch capable. While gcc
looks there for header files, gfortran does _not_, which is inconsistent
and a challenge.
Is this deliberate, or will a patch to multiarch-enable gfortran be
accepted ?
