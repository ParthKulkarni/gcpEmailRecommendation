I susupect that this does the same thing as all the greps:
   sed -n '/^root:\(\*\|!\|\):/q1' $ROOT/etc/shadow
so that should look like:
	if [ -e $ROOT/etc/shadow ] && \
           sed -n '/^root:\(\*\|!\|\):/q1' $ROOT/etc/shadow; then
		return 0
	fi
Which works by throwing an error (the q1 bit) if the pattern matches,
where the pattern should match the three cases we don't want (*, ! and
empty).
... but I've not yet checked that it really works in d-i's busybox -
should have time for that in the morning.
Cheers, Phil.
