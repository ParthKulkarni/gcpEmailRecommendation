I missed that this wouldnÂ´t fix current KDE/Plasma packages not fitting yet to 
Qt 5.9.1.
So I suggest you switch to Debian testing temporarily.
Then either aptitude install one of above meta packages will over a nice 
solution that will downgrade Qt packages to 5.7.1 againâ€¦ or you need to 
manually do that by something along the lines of
apt/aptitude install package=versionnummer
Next time check output of apt more closely. It must have shown a *very long* 
list of packages it is about to remove.
Another thing would be to temporarily install a different desktop like lxqt or 
Mate or so :)
Thanks,
