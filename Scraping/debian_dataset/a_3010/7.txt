I find this response perplexing (although I confess I don't quite
follow all the package relationships here, nor the bug referred to).
Sebastian, are you not more worried about the possibility that
r-base-core would migrate, causing lossage, than that you would
receive a bug mail requiring a simple BTS control action to reassign ?

Quite.  In the general case it is not easy to determine the cause.
People in charge of CI systems should not be expected to do that kind
of investigation.  Ideally they would be expected not to do any triage
at all.  That task needs to be distributed amongst the whole project.
CI failure triage and investigation needs to be done by the
maintainer(s) of involved package(s), who probably have some idea (or
some way to guess or find out) what on earth is going on.

If we cannot resolve this some other way we have, really, three ways
to decide:
 1. You just go ahead.
 2. You ask the DPL or owneer@bugs or the TC or someone for a formal
 decision.  Then, if the DPL or the TC say to go ahead, you add
 something to your emails along the lines of "This message was sent
 after consultation with { whoever }.  if you think that { mails of
 this kind should not be sent | bugs of this kind should not be
 filed }, please take it up with { owner@bugs | DPL TC }.
 3. You do not send the mails.
Note that not making a decison is equivalent to (3).
Ian.
