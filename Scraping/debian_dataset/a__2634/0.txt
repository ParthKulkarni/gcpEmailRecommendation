What do you want to see where? Another hunk to [1]? That doesn't seem to
feature crypto at all yet. installer/doc/devel/partman-auto-recipe.txt
doesn't mention it either.
I don't mind adding a hunk like this:
# When disk encryption is enabled, skip wiping the partitions
# beforehand.
#d-i partman-auto-crypto/erase_disks boolean false
Do you think there should be more, like an example recipe?
Kind regards
