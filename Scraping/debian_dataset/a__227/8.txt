There is a difference.
Random people will not go complaining in the street because Debian moved
to systemd.
Random people *will* go complaining in the street about issues of
statehood:

I don't think this is a sensible argument. This is not about the social
contract; I was merely trying to point out that whether something is or
is not a country is a very sensitive subject. An equally (in)valid
argument could be that by resigning, this developer was in fact
protecting the interests of users who disagree that region XYZ should be
considered a country.

That could also work, I suppose.

I think that's a bit more risky.

This isn't about "pleasing" people, and it shouldn't be. It's about
political sensitivities. Some people will think XYZ belongs in our list
and it's not there and why is Debian discriminating and oh my god it's
all gone to hell.
In the case of systemd, the explanation is "we made this choice, if you
don't want it, use a different distribution". They might be grumpy about
that, but they will use that different distribution.
In the case of XYZ, "use a different distribution" isn't going to
silence such people. Instead, they'll just yell harder. "Debian's making
a political statement about XYZ, and it's wrong, and I told them that
it's wrong, and they're ignoring me!"
Whatever solution you[1] come up with should avoid that.
[1] I'm assuming you're planning on submitting a patch, since you
    suggested this change in the first place...
