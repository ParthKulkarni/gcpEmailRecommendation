That may be true, but even so, those sensitivities are a hornet's nest
that we really don't want to be involved in.

All disputed territories *exist*, and there will almost always be a
government that de facto rules the territory, that's not the point.
Whether a region is a country, however, is not something that Debian
Developers are expected to be able to ascertain.
I don't think that's a policy that can be defended.

You're making the mistake of assuming that people who get upset over a
list of countries will check the whole list rather than just the bit
they care about...
Case in point: why would Kosovo *need* to be on the d-i list of
countries? Is there a difference between Kosovo and Serbia[1] or other
countries in the former Yugoslavia that d-i would need to be aware of
(such as locale settings, keyboard layout, time zone, or preferred
mirror), or is this bug in fact just the result of people with a
background of Kosovan nationalist ideology complaining about it to
you[2]? So far I've only seen you argue that "Kosovo needs to be on the
list that d-i presents," but I have not seen any technical arguments for
which that would in fact be necessary.
Put otherwise, is this request in fact a request about technical
matters, or is it instead a request about a political matter?
[1] In case that wasn't clear: Serbia is the country that Kosovo
    declared independence from in 2008.
[2] For clarity, I'm not saying they're right, and I'm not saying
    they're wrong. I'm not opposed to including Kosovo, even if it is
    technically not necessary, provided that it can be done in a
    politically neutral way.

Sure, fair enough.
