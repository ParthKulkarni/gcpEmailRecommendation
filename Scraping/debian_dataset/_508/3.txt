Hey,
I just upgraded a system that had ifupdown from backports.org on it.
Following cleanup and dpkg --audit etc., I ran
  root@cymbaline:/etc/apt/sources.list.d# apt-get upgrade
  Reading package lists... Done
  Building dependency tree
  Reading state information... Done
  Calculating upgrade... Done
  The following packages will be REMOVED:
    ifupdown libasprintf0c2 libperl4-corelibs-perl libuuid-perl python-bson python-pymongo
and indeed, it then went on to remove ifupdown.
What am I not understanding right here? Shouldn't "apt-get upgrade"
NEVER EVER EVER EVER remove something?
Can I find out in hindsight (can't reproduce this) what might have
happened?
Thanks,
