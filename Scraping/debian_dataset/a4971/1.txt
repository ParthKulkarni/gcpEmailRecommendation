Indeed, I've been working around this issue locally rather than doing
the right things by filing bugs and writing patches... :)

ARM64 boards all appear to have the .dtb in a sub-dir, but the fun part
is u-boot may not consistantly include the subdir when setting the
fdtfile variable.
I think the best thing to do would be to install in both
/boot/dtbs/VERSION/FDTFILE and /boot/boot/dtbs/VERSION/SUBDIR/*.dtb, or
create symlinks (if supported by the filesystem) if the file is found in
a subdir... hopefully that won't require mangling the code too much;
I'll take a look at it... or feel free to beat me to it! :)
live well,
