I recently created file /etc/flash-kernel/ubootenv.d/fdtfile with
setenv fdtfile meson-gxbb-odroidc2.dtb
on my Odroid C2 as workaround. But that is not a good permanent solution.

/boot/boot/dtbs/VERSION/SUBDIR/*.dtb is what my patch does if a subdir
is provided in /usr/share/flash-kernel/db/all.db.

If we want a more radical redesign:
Why do we rely on environment variable fdtfile at all?
The current device tree supplies file /proc/device-tree/model.
We read all.db to find the name of the dtb with this model name and than
install just this dtb from the Kernel installation.
So there is not much of a choice for U-Boot to pass different values of
fdtfile which will be of use when booting.
Couldn't we simply write the dtb file name from all.db to /boot/boot.scr?
Should the dtb file name or the model string change between two Kernel
releases we are anyway in deep trouble when upgrading (unfortunately
this may happen, cf.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d59561479e6f9cccc1d5905db37f668e1cbfdac2).
