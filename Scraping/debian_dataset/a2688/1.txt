Hello,
our business model is to we sell support for our own Debian based
distribution "Univention Corporate Server":
<https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/UniventionCorporateServer>
I recently had a discussion about NTP and their pool concept per vendor:
<http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/vendors.html>, but one question remains:
Are we (as a Debian derivate) allowed to hard-code and use the
"debian.pool.ntp.org" or must we apply for our own pool?
This might be interesting for other derivatives as well.
Thanks for any answer
Philipp (AKA pmhahn@debian.org)
PS: Paying that extra money to ntp.org would certainly not kill use, but
adding that money instead to our currently already existing support of
Debian-LTS / DebConf sponsoring / ... would probably benefit a lot more
Debian (downstream) users and developers.
