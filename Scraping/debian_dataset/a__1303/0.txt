Hi Simon,

Not speaking authoratively here but even if Arch:all binNMUs were
supported, the number of binNMUs would be insanely high :)  This is
combined with the fact that Python byte-compilation is relatively
inexpensive...

As an aside (as folks are often interested in this stuff!), the
aforementioned .clj and .class files are contained within .jar
archives which are essentially Zip archives. However, this format
can only represent timestamps >= 1980, ie. (time_t) 315576060 or
thereabouts. :)
