Thanks, that tells me the proper way to re-enable extensions, and I
think it's valuable given that on the internet people describe all sorts
of dirty way to reenable them.
On top of that, I'd like to have some more context for what's going on,
what I lose, what I gain. Like:
What is the amount of phoning home that I get if I enable that?
If I enable extensions that way, do they get updated as new versions
come out, or do I open a security nightmare of extensions making my
browser more and more vulnerable as they age?
(I noticed that I can manually trigger an update in
"chrome://extensions/", enable Developer Mode, click on "Update
extensions now")
