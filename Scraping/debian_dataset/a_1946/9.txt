This last one seems like it ought to be there.  I don't know about the
Key Usage.
IIRC there are ways to get the openssl CLI to add specific extenstions
but I don't know how to do that in the API Enrico is using in sso.
FYI, Enrico, the openssl CLI tool can dump this kind of thing so you
can compare before and after.  I forget the exact runes I'm afraid.
