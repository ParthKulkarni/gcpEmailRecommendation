"openssl x509 -text -noout" doesn't show any differences anymore
except for the obvious parts (serial, validity, modulus and sig algo).
One bit that might or might not be relevant is that the CA certificate
was re-issued on Aug 3rd:
/srv/sso.debian.org/etc $ openssl x509 -text -noout < debsso.crt 
Certificate:

This file is the one distributed to participating servers, so if
there's something wrong, it will have "infected" the other hosts as
well. I can't see anything wrong there either, though...
Starting with a blank chromium config (.config/chromium + .pki/nssdb)
and importing the client there doesn't help either.
