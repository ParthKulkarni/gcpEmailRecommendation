These apt settings keep my systems clean and I guess they would also help 
build chroots:
Apt::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant "false";
Apt::AutoRemove::SuggestsImportant "false";
Apt::Install-Recommends "false";
Apt::Install-Suggests "false";
Sometimes I even do:
# aptitude purge '~i ~M !~E !~R~i !~Rpredepends:~i'
to remove old kernels, gcc-*-base, etc.signature.asc
