FYI, docbook5-xml has existed for years, but is not up-to-date
(last updated in 2009).
I've just submitted
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=871485
against emacs25-common as it contains an obsolete DocBook RNC schema.
IMHO, Emacs should use the schema provided by the docbook*-xml packages.
So, I wonder whether there should be some form of catalog system
for the schemas (/etc/xml/catalog is for the DTD's only). Now that
DocBook 5 has its own namespace, this should be more reliable than
before.
