The net result for our users is that backports should not be expected to
be up-to-date with security. It took me approximately one minute to go
through latest DSA to find an example: Exim in backports is
4.89-2+deb9u1~bpo8+1. 4.89-2+deb9u2 has been uploaded in
December. 4.89-2+deb9u3 has been uploaded in February.
I think backports are a great asset for Debian and a clear advantage
over other stable distributions. But we shouldn't lie to our users by
telling it is security supported (and, as a matter of fact, we don't).
I am sorry if it sounds like criticism, it shouldn't. I am only trying
to show we already have a non-security-supported archive in Debian (or
best-effort-security-supported archive if it sounds better).
