	Arguably, libgpgme11 should do the same.
	It can be argued that libgpgme11 does not “provide a significant
	amount of functionality” (7.2) without gnupg.  However, and it
	seems to be a common practice in Debian, for a shared library
	package that ‘functionality’ can be understood first and foremost
	as /allowing the packages dependent on said shared library
	package to run correctly./  (The ubiquity of said practice
	is evident from how libmariadbclient18 does /not/ depend on
	MariaDB, or how libxt6 does /not/ depend on an X server package,
	and so on, and so forth.)

	I think I’ve provided sufficient evidence to refute this claim.
