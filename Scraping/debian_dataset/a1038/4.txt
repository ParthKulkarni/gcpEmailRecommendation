I think the prerequisite for making a change like this would be for the
library to be able to surface this transitive requirement in metadata so
that debhelper could support automatically adding it to the dependencies
of all linked programs (and I'm not sure that sort of collapse of our
dependency structure is a good idea).
Otherwise, if a user does want to use the functionality that GnuPG
provides but doesn't have gnupg installed since it's been relegated to a
Suggests, do they have much hope of figuring out what's wrong and how to
fix it?  Or will the package just look broken?
Minimal installation size is *not* the only goal here.  Ease of use and
lack of surprise is important to.  Personally, I'd much rather have
numerous unused packages installed than to have something break in an
opaque way when I try to use it, even if I'm unlikely to need to use it.
This is particularly the case when the additional packages don't do things
like run services or (much) increase the attack surface.
Personally, I think people in this thread are too worried about trying to
remove as many packages from their system as possible and not worried
enough about a straightforward user experience.
