Nor for clusters, for that matter.  I don't get how having the /usr part of
the filesystem (no /var, /lib, /etc, etc) would help -- and there's so many
tools that don't care about individual directories that I'd recommend you
to instead use one of:
 * btrfs
 * overlayfs
 * zfs
 * lvm
 * dm_*
 * even a bunch of mounts
rather than your scheme that requires the rest of the world to adapt to it.
