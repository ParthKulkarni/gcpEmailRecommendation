You still need all the rest of the files.  There might be cases where making
them volatile and copying from a base state to tmpfs on every boot could be
workable, but that's a pretty odd setup -- which is handled just as well by
more generic solutions.
So why won't you use any of the many ways you pruned from my post you
responded to?

So you propose to make that cluster have every node be more resource
contrained than the weakest Debian-capable SoC / phone available in the
wild?  The vast majority of non-GUI installs I've seen have /usr of below
1GB, with available storage massively larger than that.  So any realistic
HPC cluster will have many orders of magnitude more space, per node --
making even deduplication a waste of human time.  If there's indeed no
storage per-node, please don't insult our intelligence by suggesting having
the central server keep that /usr shared would require a non-laughable
effort.  And if it does... well, please read the list of solutions I
mentioned.
I quite recently worked with multi-container hosting -- there's no problem
with deduplication using already existing tools.  And in hindsight, it was a
waste of my time -- it's customers' data that takes space, not /usr.

Yes, it's an important use-case.  And one already solved without merging
/usr.
