(I suspect this might be the most useful bit of a merged-/usr concept in 
the long run).
containers become important for clusters - we are now using Singularity 
in our HPC clusters. Singularity is a development of Docker that allows 
for non-root container execution; we can build containers on our 
laptops, etc (requiring root), and copy them to the cluster, where they 
will run, even connecting with mpiexec / slurm ,etc
This is important because we've never used Debian on our high-end 
clusters before - they all have parallel filesystems for which we need 
special kernel modules (for DDN or Panasas, or Lustre), supported by the 
vendor. So we needed to use the vendors version of SuSE /Redhat/Centos 
,etc. And building complex applications was then a pain in¬† the neck.
Now, we can build a container on a laptop, with Debian inside, and run 
it on a 1000-node cluster.¬† Its realistic to see million-core jobs on 
Debian in the future.
So, while supporting containers may support a minority of users, I 
suspect some will be big users, and as library and app complexity grows, 
its an important Debian use-case.

 believing the innocent had everything to fear, mostly from the guilty but in the longer term
 even more from those who say things like ‚ÄúThe innocent have nothing to fear.‚Äù
