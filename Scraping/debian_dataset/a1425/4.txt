 Yes, it looks very much that the shutting down of volatile made wishes
appear for backports to cover it - while it wasn't (and shouldn't) be
the scope for it.  It would make it indistinguishable which packages
within backports are following the regular rules and which would be
those fast moving targets without any useful tracking or upgrade
features in the regular sense.
 (Part of that was btw. also the creation of a seperate sloppy pocket
for backports from oldstable+2 releases, to make it clear what to expect
in there)
 And yes, I'm with Alexander, the volatile maintenance can't be dumped
on the backports team.  It's a different workflow anyway.
 Good luck,
Rhonda
