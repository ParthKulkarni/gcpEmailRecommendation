I haven't checked. I will verify this tonight. I am currently on the
train back home from FOSDEM and have limited mobile internet only.

I don't disagree. It is a gcc bug, of course, when a package misbehaves
when it's miscompiled. However, fixing such bugs in gcc takes a bit more
time, but they will eventually get fixed.
This is why I asked for the workaround. There is nothing wrong with
carrying a small workaround in the debian/rules file if it helps relieving
issues porters have on some architectures.
There are many packages in Debian that have such workarounds, even for
architectures like armhf, armel, mips and so on, so it's not limited
to m68k.
Packages with such workarounds include: mesa, qtwebkit-opensource-src,
mpfr4 for example. So, yes, I absolutely agree with you that the underlying
issue is a bug in gcc which needs to be fixed. But until that has happened,
it would be very helpful for the m68k porters if the workaround can be
carried in the meantime in the debian/rules file.
My suggestion would be to add a comment with a reference to the gcc
upstream bug report to the workaround so that the busybox maintainers
can easily check whether the workaround is still necessary when they
upload a new version.
I will verify the issue with the latest gcc version tonight. If it still
exists, I will finally open the upstream bug report and add the URL
with the "forwarded" keyword to this bug report. It would then be highly
appreciated if you could add the workaround with the gcc bug report
referenced to the debian/rules file for the time being until the gcc
bug has been fixed.
Thanks,
Adrian
