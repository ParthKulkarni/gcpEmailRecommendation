I was not seeking for Salsa support.  I have originally asked a question
on debian-devel where I get usually some kind answer.  I think it was
sensible to assume that some reader of debian-devel might have had a
similar question and knows the solution.  You picked up the ball as
Salsa admin (which is nice in general, the wording leaves room for
enhancement).  In contrast to your assumption I'm able to find the Salsa
support tracker and I will use it.
 
Kind regards
       Andreas.
