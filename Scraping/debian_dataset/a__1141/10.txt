Debian contributors are not, by and large, stupid or lazy.  If you
find that many Debian contributors are making similar mistakes then
probably this is probably because of factors in their environment.
In this particular case, that environment is Salsa.  If course there
will always be mistakes and people will overlook things.  But if you
find that you are having to explain similar things over and over again
then it probably means that your user interfaces or documentation are
not sufficiently good.
A better approach, when someone asks a question you think is answered
in the docs, is to ask in a friendly way, something like this:
      Can you tell me where you looked for the answer, or where
      you looked for contact information, before asking your question
      here on debian-devel ?
      Your question seems to me to be answered here:
         https://whatever
      but perhaps that page wasn't sufficiently discoverable, or maybe
      it wasn't clear enough ?
      We want to improve the UI and the documentation so that people
      more easily find the information they need.  (And of course to
      reduce our own workload!)  So suggestions for improvement would
      be very welcome.
Personally when I make some kind of bug report or support request I
try to anticipate this kind of question.  The result is often
suggestions for improvements to docs, or docs visibility.  (Since
everything we rely on is Free Software, we can always change things to
make life smoother for users, and less burdensome for service
operators...)
