Thanks for your continous work on d-i!
Maybe it's too late for r0, but I'm still want to ask whether it's feasible
to include the patch mentioned here:
  https://bugs.debian.org/839894#30
henrich provided the patch and he verified it worked well in his virtualbox
environment.
If it's really too late for r0, how about stretch p-u or r1? And how?
Thanks for your consideration!
