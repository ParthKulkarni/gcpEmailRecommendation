Just keep the old naming convention please: 'jasper'.

At the very least you'll need to address the old CVEs in that case:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?repeatmerged=no&src=jasper
- CVE-2016-8693
- CVE-2016-8691
- CVE-2016-8692
- CVE-2016-8690
I personally fought against having duplicate JPEG 2000 libraries in
Debian (esp. since jasper seems dead upstream). I still believe you
should invest some time in replace jasper with OpenJPEG throughout
your OpenCV codebase, since OpenJPEG is used to manipulate satellite
image in professional environment.
