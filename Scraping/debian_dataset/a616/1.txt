This whole "so many packages are broken on armel" narrative
is actually mostly FUD, and you are suggesting mitigations
for a nonexisting problem.
The only major package where armel is the only release architecture 
where it can no longer be built is Node.js, and not having the Node.js 
ecosysyem on armel has already been sorted out for stretch.
Every time the topic of armel-specific major problems comes up people 
are either not nameing any specific problems, or they mention problems 
that were fixed long ago.
