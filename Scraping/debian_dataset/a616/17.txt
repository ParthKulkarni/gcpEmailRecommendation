I agree, that this support comes not for free, but the benefit
is not questionable to me: There is still relevant hardware
around which can run "armel", but not "armhf". *If* there are
enough developers and build machines, there is no reason to drop
the architecture prematurely. I can't see any relevance for
ARMv4t anymore, however.
