I noticed that both Adam and Adrian mentioned adding a Britney to ports.
 * Setting up a britney2 instance in itself is a fairly easy task and I
   am happy to assist with that.
 * We may need additional functionality in Britney to improve the
   situation for ports (like being able to synchronise with the main
   archive).  I am open to look at these requirements (if any).
Obviously, a Britney will not solve all issues you might have, but I
believe it can assist you with providing some stability.
Thanks,
~Niels
