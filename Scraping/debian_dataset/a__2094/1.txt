To be useful one also needs to change choose_partition/iscsi/do_option to call
iscsi_start() rather than iscsi-start, otherwise you're defining a
function that's never called.  Also, one needs to define
partman-iscsi/initiatorname in the template.  See:
  https://patches.ubuntu.com/p/partman-iscsi/partman-iscsi_40ubuntu3.patch
(I was rather hoping I could pull this out of launchpad with
git-remote-bzr but I seem not to have got the incatations right -- I'll
give that another try to see if I can cherry-pick the relevant commits
nicely...)
BTW Is there a reason not to also pick up the removal of '-o update'
From the Ubuntu patch while we're about it?  We seem to have as recent
open-iscsi as ubuntu, so presumably also don't need that option.
I'd use a here document (<<"!EOF!" ...) rather than all the echos.
Also, the -n is superfluos, and is not in line with the [ "$RET" ] usage
in the rest of the file.
Does the /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi actually need to be only
readable by root?  Seems needlessly restrictive to me, but I don't use
iscsi.
Cheers, Phil.
