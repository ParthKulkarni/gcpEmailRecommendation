Thanks for calling on us to make this dedication.
> If you wish to do so, please:
For those who (like me) had difficulty with some of these steps, here's
how I eventually got it done:
=====
$ curl --location --remote-name-all \
    https://people.debian.org/~jmw/dedication-9.0.txt
[…]
$ sha1sum ./dedication-9.0.txt
fb37a995eebad8ced194709a9a2eb7a68ad8979c  ./dedication-9.0.txt
$ sigfile="Your_Name"
$ gpg --detach-sign \
    --local-user "$DEBSIGN_KEYID" \
    --output "$sigfile" --armor \
    ./dedication-9.0.txt
$ gpg --verify "$sigfile" ./dedication-9.0.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed 14 Jun 2017 18:37:12 AEST
gpg:                using RSA key A1A10BC6C2451DAC42D3B28B0EA5AC6F65D1F1F7
gpg: Good signature from "Ben Finney <ben@benfinney.id.au>" [ultimate]
[…]
gpg:                 aka "Ben Finney (Debian Project) <bignose@debian.org>" [ultimate]
[…]
=====
Then attach the resulting "$sigfile" to a message to Jonathan.
