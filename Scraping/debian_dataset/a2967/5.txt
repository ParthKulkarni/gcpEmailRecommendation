The patch for #839046 also disabled --merged-usr for stretch as stretch
was added to the blacklist in first_stage_install().
debootstrap should default to non-merged-usr for stretch, but it should
be possible to enable merged-usr via the command-line parameter to avoid
the regression in debuerreotype.
