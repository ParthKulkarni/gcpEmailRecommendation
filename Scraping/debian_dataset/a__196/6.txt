Would you be OK with a minimal NMU to fix the missing file? This issue has
been blocking the D-I Buster Alpha 1 release for weeks already (even if it
hadn't been diagnosed and reported against udev-udeb until recently), and
I'd be happy to get a release out the door ASAP, since I won't have much
time in the following weeks.
