Need to be discussed with the rest of the team, I'm not really
enthuasiastic; if this only supports a subset of the archive this would
clutter the tracker data quite a bit (lots of spurious <end-of-life>
entries e.g.)
The security tracker is fairly flexible and it should take little
effort to setup a separate instance which is based on the main
data/our triage efforts while acting on a local Packages file.
Ideally document this process publicly, so that others can also run
a local security tracker if they operate a local repository.

It's two entirely different things, though. CIP intends to create
a pool of common packages used by embedded vendors, while the extended
LTS proposal extends the lifetime of a regular Debian release (for
the demands of a specific group of users).
