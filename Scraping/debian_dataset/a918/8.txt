Hey Mario,

Speaking on behalf of one of the biggest distributors of firmware on 
LVFS (Dell)
LVFS is currently in the process of plumbing this information through 
to the U/I
Just the fact that the update claims that the hardware only accepts 
signed updates or something else? :)
supposedly available on https://github.com/hughsie/lvfs-website/

and I suppose a transparency effort could solve that particular 
problem,
1.0.x but was fixed in 1.1.x - set minimum version for the update to be 
1.1.x).
To stage rollouts and monitor optional feedback in the event of a 
problem.
I will note - although slightly off-topic to the discussion at hand - 
that it would be useful to people to be able to run their own repository 
of updates and control the rollouts (and staging percentages) 
themselves. I'm not actually suggesting that Debian would need to run 
their own, but it'd be a useful service to the users who don't want to 
send telemetry to the Linux Foundation - and furthermore have a 
significant deployment where it's worth canarying the updates.
figuring out how the hell to apply it is a solved problem with 
EFI-based
Fair enough. Do you have a pointer for examples of such updates? 
Unfortunately I updated my own Dell dock recently from Windows, so I 
can't easily check. Mostly I'm interested if it's a proprietary binary 
run on the host. That's its own can of worms. (Which technically is true 
for the EFI update too, but it's staged from outside of Linux on 
boot-up.)
Kind regards and thanks
