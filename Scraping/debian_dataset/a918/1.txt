severity 916036 normal
thanks
Hi,
I'd have another - and I hope stronger - argument to upgrade the 
dependency from suggests to recommends: gnome-software is actually 
displaying an error when fwupd is not present on the bus (see attached 
screenshot).
But yes, I also second that we really should install this by default. 
I'm not sure if this could (or should) live in discover and how 
important the UI bits present in gnome-software are for this. But BIOS 
update management is becoming more important and now that large vendors 
actually publish their updates in LVFS, we should make these available 
to our users by default as well.
I'm not sure, though, if there is some philosophical objection here in 
that fwupd downloads non-free blobs and/or that Debian does not actually 
ship the blobs themselves.
