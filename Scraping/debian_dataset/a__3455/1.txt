Alex,
We do run a Gitlab instance at $work, so I may be able to try on a local
setup before affecting all of Debian. However, I'd appreciate a bit of
pointers. I've asked numerous questions, and so far got zero answer.
Since you've configured it, you probably know where its done. Having a
quick look at the documentation over here:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/administration/
I haven't find in the TOC something that looks relevant.
The only info I have from you is:

Could you please at least define what is "some of the large data stores"
and explain where it is configured in Gitlab? A possible pointer to the
Gitlab documentation would probably help as well.
Cheers,
