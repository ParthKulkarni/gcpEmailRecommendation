GNOME 3.24 modules have begun including meson build scripts.
Currently, autotools is still supported, but at least one developer
[1] has said that meson will be the only way to build his app for
GNOME 3.26. (GNOME 3.26 is scheduled for release in September.)
Has anyone trying making Debian packages that build with meson?
I found this request for debhelper to handle meson:
