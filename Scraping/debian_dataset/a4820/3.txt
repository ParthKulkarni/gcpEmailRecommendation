Hello,
I have a package (saxonhe) whose newer versions are not backwards
compatible and break other packages (build)depending on it e.g.
epubcheck. I guess this is a common problem which sometimes happens
with some packages.
Is there a way to rebuild all ${package} reverse build-dependencies in
one go in a more-or-less clean environment (chroot/container/vm)?
Thanks,
Eugene
