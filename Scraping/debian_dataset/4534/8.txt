I realise I am clearly some kind of antediluvian throwback, but:
using the issue tracker means running a massive pile of javascript,
and then creating an account.  So people who have not already paid
that price might prefer an email address.
Also, sometimes one might have a question which is not clearly an
"issue" in the sense that it should be in the issue tracker, or where
some discussion is needed to refine it, or where maybe the matter
needs to be confidential, or somethig.
Or maybe using a web issue tracker is not convenient right now.  (For
example, an email can be drafted offline or when the connectivity is
very poor.  Filling in a web form and trying to submit it over a train
wifi, say, is not usually wise.)
So I think we should advertise both.

Under "Runners" which is something to do with "shared runners".
I have no idea what even.
If I look under "Getting Help" I am directed to
  https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa#Maintenance
has a tiny section suggesting to badger people on irc.
I know it's a wiki and I could jut fix it, but as I'm not one of the
people involved, I'm a bit loathe to just spray the team email address
about.
Thanks for your understanding.
Ian.
