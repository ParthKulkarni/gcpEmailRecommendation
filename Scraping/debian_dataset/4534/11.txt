These messages are useful.  However:
(i) There is a spurious space between `Bug' and `#' in the
gitlab-generated Subject line, which leads to the BTS adding a second
copy of the bug number.
> (this message was generated automatically)
(ii) I went to report the above.  But the message does not say who is
responsible for the automation that generated it.
(iii) When I went to salsa.debian.org to try to find where to report
both of these things, there did not seem to be any contact details:

I hope the relevant people are reading debian-devel...
Thanks,
Ian.
(Actual package name, and identity of salsa committer to it, elided
from this message, as I don't want to distract.  I have deliberately
left in the bug number, so I know I haven't made their identity
secret.)
