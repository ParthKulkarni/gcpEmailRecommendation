I just sent this Go team few days ago,
https://lists.debian.org/debian-go/2018/09/msg00010.html
What I see as a replacement is using X-Go-Built-Using, like the Rust
team(which uses X-Cargo-Built-Using).
But this needs release-team (and maybe security team) to confirm as
mentioned by stapelberg
For the security concern about Go in buster, more background is at
https://alioth-lists.debian.net/pipermail/pkg-go-maintainers/Week-of-Mon-20180903/023312.html
The main issue seems that we can't simply schedule binNMU on security-master.
Whatever field is using to record the library statically embedded, the
script to filter the outdated binary is simple.
