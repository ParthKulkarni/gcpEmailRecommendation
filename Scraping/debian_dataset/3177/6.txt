As I wrote:
  It is not a good service to our users to rip gconf support
  out of many packages for buster.
This should be reverted in the packages where it was already done, 
shipping castrated packages in buster where the package in stretch was 
fully functional is not good, especially since there is no problem that 
would make it non-trivial to ship gconf in buster.
