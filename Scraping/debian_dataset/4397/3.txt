I agree it's probably not going to cause problems in practice in this case
(ironically, it's probably worse for the new software to have a higher
version in terms of unexpected apt behavior), but it's still breaking
apt's version model, and I'm not sure I can think through all the
implications.
Ideally, we would never reuse the name of a binary package for some
unrelated piece of software, although I know that's not realistic in the
real world.
