This causes a ton of headaches for the archive software.  IIRC, I believe
dak is rather unhappy about version numbers going backwards, and of course
apt is going to have no idea what to do for a system that already has the
previous package installed.  Consider also systems like
snapshot.debian.org and what they have to do to deal with this.
It's basically a whole bunch of pain that can be relatively easily avoided
and probably isn't worth chasing in every piece of software.  Version
numbers should be monotonically increasing, and I think it's reasonable
for a lot of software to bake in the assumption that's the case.
