I'll be at PostgresOpen in San Francisco during the first week of
September (I'm actually running it, and it's the US Community PostgreSQL
Conference, run under the United States PostgreSQL Association, and so I
encourage anyone dealing with PG to come to it :) and would be happy to
meet up while I'm there to do a key signing, with you and with anyone
else who is in San Francisco or nearby and/or attending PostgresOpen,
which is at the Parc 55 in Union Square.
Thanks!
Stephen
