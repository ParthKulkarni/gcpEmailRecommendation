Have you looked at https://mesamatrix.net/ ?  That is a list of
drivers, not exhaustive because VC4 and other's are not currently
tracked.
However Freedreno that supports all Adreno A4XX hardware does have a
debian package for armel and armhf.
Is that perhaps something to look into?
Here is the wikipedia page for Adreno and it lists the opengl support
per chipset:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno
^-- it's fairly complete and says that they too fall under Freedreno
Then there is this for Mali400/450:
