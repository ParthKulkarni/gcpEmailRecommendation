Great data, thanks. I'll add that.
I basically used data from the Khronos website to point me in a general
direction and then I used manufacturers specifications to fill in the
GL/GLES columns.

Not necessarily.
If the manufacturer specifies OpenGL ES support, then - on the hardware
level - it is a GLES renderer and may or may not support the entire
OpenGL specification natively. It usually requires considerable work to
make GLES hardware support OpenGL.
Eric Anhold can tell you all about the hard work he has put into
bastardising his VC4 mesa driver to make up for the lack of hardware
support:
