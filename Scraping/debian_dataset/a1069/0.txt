Isn't this already done for us here?

If anything, it should be used to fill in that list.
Many of those chipsets you list, as I understand, have a mesa driver
for them that support opengl and gles.
Such as freedreno which supports Mali A4XX series. https://mesamatrix.net/
Keep in mind, only the proprietary drivers seem to not support opengl
while the hardware is perfectly capable of doing so.
