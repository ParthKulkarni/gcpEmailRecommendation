text from that URL
This directory provides installer images in the form of a device-specific
part (containing the partition table and the system firmware) and a
device-independent part (containing the actual installer), which can be
unpacked and concatenated together to build a complete installer image.
The device-specific part is named firmware.<board_name>.img.gz
and the device-independent part is named partition.img.gz.
In addition to providing several firmware.<board_name>.img.gz files for
a number of devices with device-specific system firmware, we also
provide a firmware.none.img.gz file (containing the partition table but
without any system firmware) to provide generic installer images for
devices for which no firmware.<board_name>.img.gz file is provided.

Filenames from https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/armhf/20171227-00:09/netboot/SD-card-images/
don't have "M3", neither "A83T".
Picking firmware.BananaPi.img.gz seemed a good guess, but showed you it didn't work.
Picking firmware.none.img.gz seemed a good second guess, but showed you it didn't work.
I think that firmware.BananaPro.img.gz neither will work.
Despite that it is also a Cortex A7   (same as A20)
But still worth a try  ( niet geschoten is altijd mis )

Okay, nice.  Good the known that you also have a working Debian on ARM.

What happens at Debug TTL UART that http://www.banana-pi.org/m3.html#others shows?
Yes, that simple question  might hard to answer.
Please accept the challenge  :-)
