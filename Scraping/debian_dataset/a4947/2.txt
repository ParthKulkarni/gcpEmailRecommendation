The current version of subarch-mips-linux.c tries to detect if the CPU
is 32 or 64-bit using the CPU type. It's therefore not prepared for the
"GENERIC QEMU" type returned in /proc/cpuinfo. The code should probably
be modified to use the "isa" field as a fallback if the "cpu model"
field can't be used to determine the flavour.
That said, the quick workaround is to emulate a real CPU in QEMU. For
example you can select the 5KEf CPU which is a MIPS64R2 CPU with FPU.
