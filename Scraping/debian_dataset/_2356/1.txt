We noticed this issue today and there is a further aspect to it.
I won't have time to make a proper bug report for a couple of days.
The initrd path that was given to the pxe netboot installer
gets included in the boot command line, to wit:
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="initrd=::debian/stretch/amd64/debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz"
so we ended up with
$ cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-3-amd64 root=/dev/sdc1 ro quiet initrd=::debian/stretch/amd64/debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz
This was for a machine with no NVMe device, just an internal SSD.
During installation the ssd was enumerated as /dev/sdc.
After installation it gets enumerated as /dev/sda.
The other /dev/sdX devices seem to be usb devices in the monitor,
I've attached the hardware-summary.
See also #865473, which may be related.
Best wishes
