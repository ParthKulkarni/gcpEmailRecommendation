I just realized that the handling of bootpart is incorrect here...
Before distro_bootcmd support was added, bootpart sometimes contained
both a device number and a the partition:
  bootpart=0:1
Then, distro_bootcmd support was added, and it changed to:
  bootpart=1
But that broke legacy scripts, so distro_bootpart was added:
  distro_bootpart=1
This will result in this expanding incorrectly:
  load ${devtype} ${devnum}:${partition} ....
To render as this in the legacy case:
  load mmc 0:1:0:1 ....
I haven't figured out in u-boot's shell how to extract parts of
variables, and we're dealing with legacy versions of
u-boot... so... hrm.
This is a similar problem with the legacy u-boot-sunxi support in the
bootscr.sunxi with the "partition" variable.
Supporting legacy u-boot variables is a tangled mess, but u-boot is
definitely something people might be hesitant to update, at risk of
bricking a system.
