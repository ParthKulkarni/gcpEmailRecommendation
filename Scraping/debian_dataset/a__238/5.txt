lxde page is bad, I didn't say anything about the quality of information
on it but I do think (and would love to be proven otherwise) that
average Joe of 2017 will feel more appealed towards lxde page than our
debian.org. I do agree that quality shouldn't suffer but than we do have
a lot of out-of-date docs, Arch wiki being much better than our own etc
etc. We need to improve the quality overall and make it more accessible
to everyone and that includes people who use modern workflows/moder
views/designs etc. Or run a huge global survey what people want to see
from Debian...

I mentioned Linux because it was previously mentioned that LXDE page
doesn't mention it can be installed on Linux (and afaik it can be also
on FreeBSD/Hurd?).
