Crypto folks have been dubious about RIPEMD160 for a while for new
applications, just because it's pretty old and doesn't have some of the
nice properties of modern hashes.  It's more proactive than SHA-1 to drop
it, but I support dropping it just as a precautionary measure.  There
isn't a good reason to keep using it so far as I know.
