In conclusion: don't buy AMD or Intel CPUs.
AMD processors have bugs too.Â Just look at the recent changes to the
amd64-microcode package. If you are unlucky, there might not even be a
workaround and it can take months to reproduce, find the root cause and
fix it. Comparing the patch IDs can give you a hint how many iterations
were needed.
I don't see much difference between AMD and Intel when comparing
Henrique's announcement with my first-hand experience with one of the
vendors.

The same complaint can be said about the AMD microcode updates.
