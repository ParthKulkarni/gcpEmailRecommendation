so in conclusion: don't buy intel. At least in future.
I must say I'm utterly disappointed by this crap. "hey there is a hug bug, we
dont tell you what it is exactly, or how we fixed it, but YOU MUST INSTALL THIS
BINARY BLOB TO FIX IT. (and btw, this is for skylake, for kaby lake, ahem, maybe,
we have no idea, but do install that crap^wblob too.")
Are there any other public bug reports which got fixed by this, or is the
ocaml issue the only known issue which gets fixed by installing this microcode
update?
(and I hope this were obvious, but I guess it's not, so: I'm saying Intel sold and
still is selling us crap here, not Henrique, who tiredlessly tries to help dealing
with that crap. Thank you, Henrique, for this, that's really nice of you.)
