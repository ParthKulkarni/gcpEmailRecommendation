Hm... I tried the packages I uploaded last month to people.d.o, and they
do not fail those tests anymore. At least,
# printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n" | nc localhost 80
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
# printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nFoo: b\0ar\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 80 
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
# printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\0\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 80            
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
This all looks good...

Well, it's rather strange but things all seem to work here.. .The above
now returns the 400 error as expected.

That should be acceptable. I am not sure it does it correctly, however:
# printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 80
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
That doesn't look right, actually - shouldn't this return a 200?
# printf "GET /\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 80
returns a correct 200, however.

The problem with wheezy is that it would require reviewing years of
patches to see which one have been factored upstream:
apache2-2.2.22$ diffstat debian/patches/* | tail -1
 92 files changed, 3687 insertions(+), 1533 deletions(-)
It's interesting that this is similar to the diff between the two
versions. ;) In other words, the diff between upstream 2.2.22 and
debian's is about as big as the diff between debian's 2.2.22 and
2.2.32....

security@lists.d.o is not a list, as far as i know. there's
debian-security@lists.d.o, but I never posted there... or did you mean
team@security.debian.org?

I had hoped that posting on the debian-lts@ would generate such
feedback, but it seems only you have responded (which is greatly
appreciated!). I was hoping other LTS workers or volunteers would step
up for this since I left that code .. now one month ago!!

Good idea, I have also included this - rather blindly, unfortunately: i
don't quite know if this is the right place for this fix - and
reuploaded this to people.debian.org.
I'll give this one last week of testing then just upload the freaking
thing, it's been long enough testing already...
