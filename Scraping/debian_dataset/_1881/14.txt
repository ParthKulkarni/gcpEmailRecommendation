Understood. I was wondering if I should change it somehow... Note that I
do not use the 2.2.32 version, but some inferior one, which is probably
also wrong... I have just removed this chunk from the patchset.

Ack.

Right, good catch, I'll take a look at those now.

Thanks!!

Understood, I'll report back what I found.

I agree. Lots of domain names break RFC, I was surprised to find in the
past... I'll take a look.
By the way, would it be possible to enable the test suite in the package
build, since we have the code ready to go there anyways? Or in
autopkgtest?
I was wondering how to run the apache2 test suite, which I figured would
necessarily exist, but didn't find it in the package so I gave up...
