Hi
I think we should be fairly safe with both options. That is both
releasing your fixed version and ship 2.2.32 directly. Apache have a
rather good reputation on backwards compatiblity.
Unfortunately I could not test myself as my servers were running i386
and the debs were for amd64.
Best regards,
// Ola
