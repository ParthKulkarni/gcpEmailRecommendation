and even Oracle does this better than Debian soon: "Oracle says that
starting with April 18, 2017, Java (JRE) will treat all JAR files signed
with the MD5 algorithm as unsigned, meaning they'll be considered insecure and
blocked from running." - via https://developers.slashdot.org/story/17/01/21/0538232/
We really ought to do the same. I'm all for keeping sha1+sha256, but
please let's *completely* drop md5sums for buster.
