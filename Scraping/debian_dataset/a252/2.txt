  Description     : invoke a program under a different name
The rname utility invokes a specified program, passing a different name
instead of the name of the program executable.  This could be useful in
a number of cases, both during software development, testing, and in
production use.  There are many programs that do different things based
on what name they have been invoked under; the rname utility avoids
the need to e.g. create ephemeral symlinks to run these programs in
some conditions when they have not been completely installed.
I originally wrote this tool in 2000 and I'm resurrecting it now for
the purpose of writing unit and integration tests for just such
a multifaceted program.
G'luck,
Peter
