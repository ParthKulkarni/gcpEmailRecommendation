Note: https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/ch04s02.html.en is
the canonical link the "where-files" xref links to. That points to a
HTTP-only http.us.debian.org, which is internally composed from
"&url-debian-installer;".
From urls.ent that's because &disturl; embeds &url-archive; which embeds
&archive-mirror;, which is http.us.debian.org. There are also various
HTTP-only links in there.
Should we go and just replace that with deb.debian.org, which presumably
has all architectures, and convert (most of) the links to HTTPS?
We could then still apply Michael's patch, as long as we use
&url-debian-installer; properly for the URL. (The link wouldn't work
as-is anyway because it should use &releasename; instead of hard-coding
"stretch".)
Kind regards and thanks
