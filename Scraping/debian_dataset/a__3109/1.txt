That's because lzip was used with max settings, xz with the defaults.
If you want a fair comparison:
-rw-r--r--  1 kilobyte kilobyte 98826240 Jun 16 20:26 octave-4.2.1.tar
-rw-r--r--  1 kilobyte kilobyte 15826565 Jul  7 17:13 octave-4.2.1.tar.lz
-rw-r--r--  1 kilobyte kilobyte 15174400 Jul  7 17:13 octave-4.2.1.tar.xz
xz wins by 4.2%, with the same settings.
Thus, I'd recommend dropping lzip completely.  It's worse and obscure.
With every distro having standardized on xz, providing lzip tarballs is
a pure waste of space.
