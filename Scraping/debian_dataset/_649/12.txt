Hi Cyril,
I didn't receive much feedback from the -boot team since I created the
Salsa project and did the initial member import, but I also didn't
remind people about it after those first few emails.
FWIW I have been using GitLab both personally and at work very
successfully for quite a while now with my generally Git-centric
workflow. I have no recent experience with conversions from other VCS,
and I do understand some people's concerns about whether GitLab is the
best fit for Debian, but I strongly believe that whilst it may require a
bit of a mindset readjustment it's the best thing out there for us.
I also must admit that I haven't had a huge amount of time lately to
work on Debian things, much to my regret. From now on for a while I will
have even *less* time, but with no regret now as my first child was born
yesterday! (Mother and child doing very well, thanks, and email to
-private will come shortly!)
I think I will have to leave the Salsa -boot project to you and the rest
of the team going forwards.
Cheers,
Chris
