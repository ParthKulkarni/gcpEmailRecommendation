Bypassing someone's local caching proxy would similarly make someone
unhappy.  However, that scenario seems sufficiently rare compared to the
common case that I think we can tell people, via release notes, that
they should either do an expert install or otherwise specify the proxy
another way.  Or, as you sugest below, let people cancel and go back.

In the general case, you'd need a Javascript interpreter. :)

That sounds reasonable.
