Currently we have these steps
* hardware detect
* network configuration with DHCP and manual config upon fail
* allways ask for proxy
* do the download
What I would like to see, are these steps
* hardware detect
* network configuration with DHCP and manual configuration upon failure
* inform user there is test download going on, allow "quick fail" (don't wait for time out)
** upon fail: ask for a proxy configuration 
** upon succes: fine, just continue
* do the download
