Just how would you autodetect if a proxy should be used?  You can detect
if internet access works without one perhaps, but that doesn't mean a
proxy isn't desired.  I have actually encountered a network where the
firewall allowed access to one debian mirror without going through the
proxy, but security required going through a proxy.  Good luck detecting
that mess correctly.
