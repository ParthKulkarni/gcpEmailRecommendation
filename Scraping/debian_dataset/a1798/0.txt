Other arm64 rockchip boards also use the vendor prefix in recent
versions, at least in current u-boot git master (see:
a2a5053a15e4059c7445737d60f7b8425ca863f8). Only 32-bit arm boards do not
include the vendor prefix, just like in the linux kernel.
If any of the tooling doesn't support with a vendor prefix, it should be
fixed.

Indeed, I've been keeping an eye on it and occasionally nudging to push
upstream. I even tried patching the Debian u-boot packaging from those
branches, but haven't managed to get a working booted system yet.
Once it lands upstream, especially with some testing from others, I can
happily add it to u-boot in Debian.

I don't really agree that it's consistant with other rockchip boards
(see above).
All arm64 linux dtbs are in sub-dirs, flash-kernel supports them in
sub-dirs, and u-boot should generally just append the value of fdtfile
to whatever search path and look for it there.

Thanks for the pointers.
