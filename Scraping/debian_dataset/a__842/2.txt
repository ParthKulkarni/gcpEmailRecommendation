Hi, 
in the face of the current spam attacks I implemented CertFP for my 
irker instance. I also updated the default irc link in gitlab. However,
it is possible that every project using the bot has to migrate the server
setting to ssl. So if you miss messages from salsa bot, please check that you
use ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697/ as server setting in the irker integration.  
Thanks
Alex
