While autotools in principle do support out-of-tree builds, a particular
program might still fail.  And, most non-autotools non-cmake build systems
don't support that at all.
In such cases, there's a heavy hammer of linking the whole build tree to
two temporary directories, and building from those.
For example, crawl does:
tree-stamp:
        dh_testdir
        mkdir build-console
        cp -ldpR docs settings source CREDITS.txt build-console/
        mkdir build-tiles
        cp -ldpR docs settings source CREDITS.txt build-tiles/
        touch tree-stamp
then for actual build:
        cd build-console/source && $(MAKE) $(ARGS_CONSOLE)
        cd build-tiles/source && $(MAKE) $(ARGS_TILES)
Meow!
