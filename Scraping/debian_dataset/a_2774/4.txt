It looks like you are trying to use Debian smtp servers. I just use
smtp.gmail.com.
There is a Gmail trick where you can add one send-as email and provide
smtp.gmail.com credentials.
You might have to create an app password.
I think that this guide does something similar to what I did:

Let me know if this works out for you.
