Hi,
I'm working on dates for 9.2; by a two month cycle we're aiming for around
23rd September. How about one of:
23rd/24th September
30th Septmber/1st October
[SRMs: needs one of you too please :) ]
After discussion with Adam and Steve, we felt it made sense to work on 2
months for stable and 4 months for oldstable; that way there isn't a month
3 to try and fit in betweens. So every other stable update will also be an
oldstable.
Thanks,
