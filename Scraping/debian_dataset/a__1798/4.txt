Everything.
Because there is no support for the rock64 in upstream u-boot.
And then it is a little evil in that the last time I checked blobs were
required to construct a signed image with ATF.

Right.
More precsisely:
U-Boot (upstream) has efi_dtb_prefixes=/ /dtb/ /dtb/current/.
It searches for $fdtfile in those places before loading and efi application.
This is shared by the vendor u-boot.
The only trouble is that fdtfile is set to "rockchip/rk3328-rock64.dtb"
rather than plain "rk3328-rock64.dtb" like other rockchip boards
supported in upstream do.
^^
I think this is the pain point.

I have been watching the u-boot mailinglist and there was nothing.
There only seems to be this single person Kamil Trzci≈Ñski doing serious
work in this direction.
E.g. see his mainline branch on github:
https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-u-boot/commits/mainline-master
It looks like he might want to push these up stream at one point.
It was his decision to go with the rockchip subfolder:
https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-u-boot/commit/9c204e7343577e8b922556bf9349a457c139976e
I guess we could ask him to accept a patch allowing the dtb to reside at
the root level? That way it would behave like upstream rockchip boards.
