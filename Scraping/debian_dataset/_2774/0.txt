Well, if the packages are moved to the attic and removed from
packages_list, the translation will vanish from the master files at
the next l10n-sync run....and therefore will not interfere with statistics.

Well, we never did that (not counting arch-specific packages in
statistics), which would enforce the idea that some arches are "more
important" than others. But that's of course debatable given that the
number of people installing a kFreeBSD system in anything else than
English is probably near to zero.
For sure, such packages' translations shoudl be marked for levels 3
and higher and shouldn't clutter the stats for levels 1 and 2.
