Indeed. I have adapted the sound and bluetooth configuration in my
repository from that one. The author of that repository has helped me
in getting my ISO remade with all features working.

Currently, I have not made the custom repository. I can share the URL
of my preseeded configuration generated ISO, though that is designed
more for an OEM-style install (it destroys the data on the PC and
recreates a fresh stretch install) and it is still under development
(in sync with my salsa repository).
In you case, my suggestion would be to mail me offline and I can guide
you. But the short story for sound is that you should get the
sound-config.tar.gz from my repository:
https://salsa.debian.org/akumar/debian-installer-rdp-thinbook/raw/master/sound-config.tar.gz
Extract the files to /root and run /root/hardware/sound/install.sh.
For more help, just mail me off-list. Also, I can share the ISO I
build using the above repository; I am not publishing the URL yet
because it is still evolving.
Thanks.
Kumar
