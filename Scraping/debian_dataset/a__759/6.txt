A silly nitpick but the "4.14.13-iitb-amd64" in package a named "linux-
image-4.14.13-iitb-amd64" is actually the kernel ABI (4.14.13-iitb) and
arch (amd64) which is not exactly/necessarily the same as the version.
There is also a third field "flavour" which you don't have here but
which would go between the two e.g. "linux-image-4.14.0-3-rt-amd64" is
a rt patched kernel.
You should definitately give the package a distinct version and you
should _probably_ give it either a distinct ABI or flavour (or possibly
both). You will probably also want to put a digit in your distinct ABI
so you can rev it if needed.

I _think_ you can add hooks/files to the package so that reportbug DTRT
here, but I don't know the specifics of how.
