Thanks. I'll keep this in mind. The only point I'd like to emphasize
is that we are clear that ours will NOT be a derived distribution; our
Debian will have only a few kernel line diffs with the pristine
Debian, and no further changes. And, like I have pointed our to Ian,
we intend informing the users that this is the case, and provide the
changes we have made through the same distribution channel as our
modified packages.
Thanks again!
Kumar
