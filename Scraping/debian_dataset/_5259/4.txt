Just to note that there is also the codespell tool, also available in
Debian as a package.
However, both Lintian and codespell only try to detect misspellings, not
fix them.  In Lintian's case this is kind of obvious - it is supposed to
operate on the result of a build (even if source-only), so it cannot
really figure out where the source of the misspelling is.  For codespell
I wonder if the author didn't try to include any fixing functionality for
at least one major reason: some of the misspellings it detects are false
positives, sometimes these are real words, or variable or function names,
or domain-specific terms, or even (at least for the hexer and stunnel4
packages that I help maintain) actual words *in another language* :)
So, hm, it may be nice to have a tool that also corrects misspelled
words, but IMHO it should either be interactive or, at the very least,
support some kind of per-project whitelist of words that it should not
really try to correct.
In any case, thanks for trying to make Debian better, whatever direction
this happens to go into!
G'luck,
Peter
