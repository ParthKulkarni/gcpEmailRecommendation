Hi,
the following vulnerability was published for busybox. I realize you
know of the issue already but just filling to have a tracking bug as
well in the BTS.
CVE-2017-16544[0]:
| In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox through
| 1.27.2, the tab autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list
| of filenames in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in
| executing any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially
| result in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.
If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.
