please get of your high horse.
I'm not sure it is said anywhere that one has to care about ports and/or
some pet projects.
Also, you wrote a mail to d-d-a that rust is now running on 14 archs, so
I was utterly surprised about your mail a few hours later blaming
someone who uploaded a rust library.
That said, I do understand your frustration and I do applause your work
on "strange" ports, however, most of us are here to have Debian running
nicely on hardware used by the 99%, and if those two objectives are
getting in each others way, I'm not sure you have moral or practical
grounds to demand that we priotize your 1% needs over those of the 99%.
sorry.
