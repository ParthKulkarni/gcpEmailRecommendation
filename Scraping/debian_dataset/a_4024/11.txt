If the maintainer of a package doesn't understand which reverse
dependencies his package has, he shouldn't be the maintainer of
his package.
I don't understand why you are defending his behavior. It's simply
not nice to pull such a stunt after I put in all these efforts to help
others.
If you think it is, then the CoCs we have aren't worth the "paper"
they are written on.
FWIW, I am not subscribed to debian-devel, please keep me CC'ed.
Thanks,
Adrian
