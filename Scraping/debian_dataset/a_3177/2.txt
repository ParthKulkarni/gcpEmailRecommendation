Why? Basically there are only two things left in Buster that depend on
gconf: eclipse and pulseaudio. pulseaudio is being worked on upstream
so I expect that to be resolved in time for Buster. Eclipse is a major
headache as you know.
Please be more specific about what software you are interested in that
requires gconf and why it can't be ported away from gconf this year.
Thanks,
