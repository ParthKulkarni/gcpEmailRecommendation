It was purely a conservative duplication of existing symlinks. I can
drop the old md5 symlinks, if there's a consensus that they are no
longer needed in unstable. I could also include -compat for both
symlinks, if this needs to go in a stable update, just to be sure we're
not making a breaking change for users in Stretch.
