The discussion on IRC between myself, apt folks and Adam was leaning
towards an apt config & cmdline option.
There was an interesting idea about pinning, but in the end it was
concluded that this wouldn't be workable because the pinning would
only be generated after apt had already started.

There is still the question of if we want to allow deviation from the
baseline at all and if we don't, who is going to do the work to
achieve the goal of falling back on baseline code at runtime for all
upstreams.

It cannot use files from the package, since those are not available in preinst:
