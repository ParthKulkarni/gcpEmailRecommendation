Please check the various initramfs-tools configuration files to see if
you're using MODULES=dep.  Changing to MODULES=dep would be the fix.
However, given the size of your ramdisk, I fear you are already using
MODULES=dep.
Are you using RAID or LVM?  Unfortunately, since the MTD partition for
the ramdisk is very tiny on the TS-x09, you cannot use RAID or LVM.
(And this was possible in the past, which will lead to problems with
upgrades.)

I have to document the LVM/RAID issue.  In fact, the installation page
currently says "You can use LVM and RAID and a number of filesystems",
which is definitely no longer true to due to the size issue (even with
MODULES=dep).
