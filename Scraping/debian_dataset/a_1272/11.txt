If I understand correctly, the objection was to how sysvinit behaves
(for which I have now opened #851427) - it puts the symlink at /dev/shm and
the real mount at /run/shm.
I don't think systemd is doing anything wrong here. Upstream systemd is
correct to mount the actual filesystem on /dev/shm, and IMO it's also
valid for Debian systemd to make the symlink.

This sounds like a job for post-stretch. Let's not remove low-cost
compatibility symlinks right now :-)
