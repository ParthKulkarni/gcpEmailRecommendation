That would have been an option for upstart.
But there are multiple cases where an uninstalled but not purge package
has side-effects.
See uninstalled-but-not-purged packages shipping SysV init scripts.
Basically, every package which allows to be extended by other packages
via .d directories is affected.
Take logrotated as a example and the dance e.g. rsyslog has to do in
preinst/postrm.

So dpkg would have to remember if a conffile was removed by the admin
prior to the uninstallation. Doesn't sound too complicated to me, we
already have an obsolete flag in the status file. We'd just have to
extend that with a new flag. Then again, I'm no dpkg hacker, so maybe
there are subtleties I don't see.
