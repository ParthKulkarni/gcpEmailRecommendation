Conffiles which continue to have an effect on the system after their
package has been removed seems like a bug to me. I'd be tempted in this
case to provide a transitional upstart package which fixed these
conffiles to properly test for upstart.[1]

This breaks the expectation that `apt remove foo; apt install foo;`
would lead to foo working with the same configuration if deletion of
configuration files is meaningful for foo. [For example, apache operates
this way.]
1: Though this sort of guarding is easy for Xsession.d, I'm certain that
there are configuration systems where this is not easy to implement.
