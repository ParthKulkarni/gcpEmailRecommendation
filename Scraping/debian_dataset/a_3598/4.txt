In my mind, conffiles of a package is a set. If any one of these
conffiles was removed by the admin, imho the whole set is now
modified. And sticking with the current behaviour is imho the path of
least surprise.
If the whole set is unmodified, then deleting all of them, is imho the
path of least surprise.
