I've been reading this thread and keep being reminded of our
discussion on #debian-dpkg a while ago.
I think most of the complaints about Debian source package formats are
rooted in a design mistake made early on. The debian/ directory. The
debian/ dir controls the upstream source but is in a subdirectory of
the upstream source. The directory hierarchy is an inverse of the
relationship between its parts. The debian/patches/ dir is another
layering violation on top of that.
