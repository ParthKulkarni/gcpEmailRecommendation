Hi!
I'm interested in what things people still find so off-putting to the
point of not wanting to use the new 3.0 source formats, or what makes
people use them in anger and similar (if people would state which one
of these apply that would be helpful). All these including objective
and subjective issue. And even existing bug references would be fine.
I've created an initial draft wiki page with few things I had noted
down, where I'll try to summarize things mentioned on the thread:
  <https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/SourceFormatProblems>
(I'm not using <https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0> because
TBH it read more like a sales brochure than a more neutral pageâ€¦)
Thanks,
Guillem
