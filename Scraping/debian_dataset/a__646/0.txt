We could have a directory containing a tarball, some patches, and some
sort of spec for how to build it? I hear some people with brightly-coloured
headgear might have tried this particular design :-P
Joking aside, the attempts I've seen at managing SRPMs in a version
control system have either not tracked upstream source at all (Fedora), or
invented a layout that is actually a lot like Debian's but with packaging/
instead of debian/ (Tizen).
