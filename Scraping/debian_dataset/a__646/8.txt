It would have the huge benefit that upstream .git* files would stay in
the upstream folder, and wouldn't conflict. I had for example issues
with conflicting .gitreview files when using Gerrit for the Debian
packaging.
I don't see however any advantage of moving the patches folder outside
of the debian folder.
