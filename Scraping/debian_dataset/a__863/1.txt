Comments/Problems:
Grub install failed, because of Bios security options (linked to UEFI).
Not a big problem, as you guys allways does a good job!
But I would like to suggest this improvement:
---------------------------------------------
Entering Rescue Mode, d-i ask for root file system, displaying a list of 
partition without further informations. 
The choice is not easy, as you can't exactly remember what you've done a few 
minutes (hours) before. A few informations, like size, label, filesystem type 
would help a lot.
May be d-i should launch partitioner before rescue mode, in a "safe mode" like 
(not allowing changes), because its screen gives every informations one need.
