Package: installation-reports
Severity: critical
Justification: breaks the whole system
Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***
   * What led up to the situation?
happens after install, upon new system boot
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
hours and hours of web search, ineffective
   * What was the outcome of this action?
system boots ok but throws errors:
nouveau:lots of numbers: firmware: failed to load nvidia/gm206/gr/sw_nonctx.bin (-2)
nouveau: gr: failed to load gr/sw_nonctx
gr ctor failed, -2
ALSO, sp5100_toc bug still exists, until I blacklisted in on the hard drive
Then screen flashes (with errors still visible) for several seconds, then stops flashing, then hangs forever.
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
normal boot to desktop

Comments/Problems:
See above.  I don't know where this problem exists in the installation package.
<Description of the install, in prose, and any thoughts, comments
      and ideas you had during the initial install.>
Partitoning setup interface is particularly clumsy and always has been.  Not intuitive.  We have to "guess" at the correct answers and run it through until it fails (after trying to boot), then go back and try the next "guess" hoping that will work.  Maybe use a graphical partition setup with choices selected from the (visible) option tree and allow a description of each choice and sub-choice when the user hovers the mouse.  Most everything else is self-explanatory and you guys have done a wonderful job with it!
