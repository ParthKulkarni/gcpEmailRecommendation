This is not entirely true. Let me add an important part of your problem
description you sent me over another channel:
This holds for plain text files that have no filename extension, e.g.
‚Äúfoo‚Äù. A file named ‚Äúfoo.txt‚Äù undergoes mime-type mapping and is served
with ‚ÄúContent-Type: text/plain‚Äù just fine.

Apache uses /etc/mime.types to translate extensions into mime types,
which, in my eyes, is a design flaw, because it is a 1:n mapping used by
Apache for reverse lookups. Every time an extension maps to more than
one mime type, Apache seems to drop the Content-Type header. As ‚Äúno
extension‚Äù is mapped in mime.types to many mime types (mind you: not to
*no* mime type), the DefaultType doesn't kick in.
What you are probably looking for is this:
