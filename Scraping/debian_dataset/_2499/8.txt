Hi,
this is my yearly hint to the teammetrics graphs you can find for your
team at
     http://blends.debian.net/liststats/
The idea for the graphs was first presented at DebConf8[1] and the final
realisation was done by Sukhbir Singh in a GSoC project[2].  I'm generating
the graphs at beginning of each month.
Last year I added some teams to the metrics set - feel free to ask me to
add your team if you are interested.  You could also make suggestions for
new graphs that might be interesting.
Kind regards
        Andreas.
