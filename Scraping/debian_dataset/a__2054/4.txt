I don't like it either.
In addition to the reasons already explained, bandwidth is a precious
resource that should not become mostly unavailable at random times by
default.
A sudden drop in available bandwidth could be as inappropriate as an
anti-virus popping up. Imagine that happening during a presentation
in which you expect all bandwidth to be available.
If we want to be the Universal OS, we can't assume that any time
(not chosen by the user) is ok to do an upgrade.
Thanks.
