At least the following are universal:
lsattr, chattr
badblocks
/usr/sbin/filefrag (really shouldn't be in sbin)

I'm not sure if _host_ systems with space so low to care about getting rid
of e2fsprogs are real use cases (such extreme embedded are not going to run
unmodified Debian).  Containers on the other hand have little use for fsck
or badblocks, and only rarely for {ls,ch}attr or filefrag.  Thus, requiring
users of other filesystems to have e2fsprogs installed is not a big burden,
even if we'd still want the option to not have any such tools at all.

Alas, this plan would break partial upgrades from stretch to buster.  Thus,
we'd need to do 3) in buster then 4) only in bullseye.

Sounds good to me.
