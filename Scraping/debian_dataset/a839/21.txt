Apologies for not responding sooner.  Between a crazy travel schedule
(kernel summit in Prague, teaching a tutorial at LISA 2017 in San
Francisco, and recovering from a killer case of Flu), I just hadn't
really gotten to this earlier.
1)  If people really want to make e2fsprogs non-essential, I'm not
going to object seriously.  It's the downgrade of e2fsprogs from
Priority: required to Priority: important which where things get
super-exciting.
2) I'm at this point I'm not really enthuiastic to move lsattr out of
e2fsprogs.  We are still adding new features to ext4, some of which
will require new flags, and chattr/lsattr et.al. *were* originally
designed to be only for ext 2/3/4.  Other file systems have decided to
use the same ioctl, which is fine, but I've always considered
chattr/lsattr to be an ext 2/3/4 utility first, and more generic file
system utility second.  Moving lsattr out of e2fsprogs to some other
package (e.g., util-linux) will make my kernel development much more
inconvenient.
3) Lsattr/chattr et.al depend on the e2fsprogs shared libraries, so
moving them into a separate binary package isn't going to save as much
space as you would like.  So it's not at all clear the complexity is
worth it.
4) If the real goal is reduce the size of minbase, there is a much
more effective thing we can do first, or at least, in parallel.  And
that is to move the l10n files to a separate foo-l10n package.  The
last time I did this analysis was with Debian Jessie, but I don't
think the numbers have changed that much.  Of the 201 MB i386 minbase
chroot, 33MB, or over 16% can be found in /usr/local/locale.  The
breakdown (using Debian Jessie numbers) are:

In Debian Stretch, I've already done this separation for e2fsprogs, so
the installed size of e2fsprogs is only 1309kB.  And so I've already
made harvested way more than half of the savings of getting rid of
e2fsprogs from the minbase set by the simple expedient of moving the
/usr/share/locale files to e2fsprogs-l10n.
Simply splitting coreutils into coreutils and coreutils-l10n would
reduce minbase by a factor of *six* over getting rid of e2fsprogs from
minbase.
Does this mean trying to get to Essential: no for e2fsprogs is a bad
thing?  No, but if your goal is reduce the size of minbase for Debian,
I just want to point out that there is **much** lower hanging fruit
that folks might want to consider harvesting first.

P.S.  In case it isn't obvious, the reason why it's interesting to
shrink the size of minbase is that it makes Debian much lighter-weight
for Docker --- you don't need e2fsck or mke2fs in most docker
containers based on Docker; neither do you need the translations into
Turkish, German, Spanish, Chinese, etc., for e2fsprogs, coreutils,
dpkg, etc., for most Docker containers.
When I asked the question *why* is it worth it to spend the effort to
reduce the size of Essential: yes, I was told it was it was a
prerequisite of reducing the set of packages where Priority is
"required", and *that* was because it allowed for a reduction of the
minbase set, which in turn is intersting for reducing the size of
Docker images.  If there are other reasons why people want to make
e2fsprogs no longer essential: yes, it's good to have those out on the
table, since it may be that there are other things we can do first, or
in parallel, that might be *far* more effective towards the real end
goal that people have.
