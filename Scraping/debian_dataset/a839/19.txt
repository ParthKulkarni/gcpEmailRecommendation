Currently the only negative dependency is initramfs-tools, which has a
Breaks against versions older than stable (but not oldstable).
I note that both systemd and sysvinit would have to gain a Depends, so
at least bootable systems should be fine. The intersection of
"non-bootable systems" and "systems that need e2fsprogs" should be
small. (Please enlighten me if I'm lacking in imagination)
Would backporting this dependency to stable be possible/feasible?

I don't think that's necessary as init is Important: yes, and both
systemd and sysvinit will have to gain a dep on e2fsprogs.
