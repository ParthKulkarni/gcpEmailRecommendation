This is a fair point, but I think the perfect is the enemy of the good.
I agree that moving badblocks, lsattr and chattr to another package or
inside src:util-linux is something worth to consider. Yet, it feels like
a secondary thought to me. It is not something I will drive.
Once e2fsprogs is non-essential, you'll know exactly which packages to
look at for finding users of these tools, so we can simply do in two
steps.
Look, we started considering optional e2fsprogs in 2011. Work is ongoing
for 6 years now. If we ever want to finish, we need to do it in small
steps rather than pulling more issues into it.
The question should be: "Do we face negative consequences in doing so?"
rather than "What else can we fix about e2fsprogs?".
