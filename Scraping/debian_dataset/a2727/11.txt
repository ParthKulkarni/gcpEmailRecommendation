I've added a patch to detect such issues and bail out when they happen,
tested in asachi's armhf sid chroot:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/debian-installer.git/commit/?id=3313d94
[ It's a little sad to have missed the ‚ÄúDisk full‚Äù message in the logs
for months. ;) ]
As far as I can tell, only this needed an update:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/debian-installer.git/commit/?id=199fe0b
And I've also checked that bumping from 40k to 50k is sufficient to have
a successful build of src:debian-installer (in release build mode: with
unstable in debian/changelog, so building against udebs from testing).
I'll leave you or vagrant push an updated value once you agree on
something.
