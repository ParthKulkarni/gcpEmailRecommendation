As mentioned a couple hours ago, patches were pushed for that, and I've
also verified that the 40k to 50k bump is sufficient. We can experiment
with a higher value (like the proposed 100k) in unstable, and maybe
backport the bump in a stretch point release, but I'll go for a minimal
bump that is sufficient for all builds for the time being.
Thanks everyone for your collective input. Feel free to discuss the
merits of a bump to a given specific value in a bug report against
src:debian-installer, for further action.
