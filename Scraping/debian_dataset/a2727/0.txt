I have done test builds with both 50MB and 100MB raw image size. 
The difference in the resulting compressed binary size is less
than 60kBytes, so that shouldn't pose a problem even for people
on very-low-bandwidth internet connections.  I suppose the
additional write time to the target medium also isn't much of a
problem either.  On modern SD cards, linear write rates are nearly
always larger than 5MB per second (even cheap SD cards nowadays
commonly reach nearly 10MB/s on linear writes), so setting the
image size to 100MB costs at most 10 seconds of extra write time. 
That shouldn't be a problem even for CI systems that do lots of
image writes.
If the size increase eases debugging, I think it is worth that
cost, so I'll commit a change to ~100MB to d-i git.

Karsten
