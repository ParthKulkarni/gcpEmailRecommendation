I'd like to gently push for making it even larger, say 100MB. when
debugging different kernel versions, it's often helpful to be able to
append all modules to the initrd.gz, which can result in ~30MB+ initrd
images, which usually means an extra step to copy all the files onto
another partition, rather than copying them in-place...
There are very few (micro)SD cards or USB sticks that can't handle that
size, though I guess it would needlessly increase write times for the
images to write the extra empty space...
