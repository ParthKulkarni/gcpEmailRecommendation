Hi.
I have the following in a preseed file:
(stripped out various confirmation things that are unrelated to paritioning)
d-i partman-auto/method string lvm
# Oh well, the following doesn't exist in Debian and is left
# over from the time the preseed was used for Ubuntu.
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string 43G

              .
As far as the documentation goes, I would expect that on a machine
with ~560GB of disk (array) that all of the following should be true:
- Disk completely consumed by partitions (yep)
- A single large physical volume for LVM (yep)
- /boot partition outside LVM (yep)
- small free space at start and a GPT/efi partition (yep)
- root (/) partition to have at most 41GB (yep)
- swap to have at most 2GB (NO)
- root partition to be much larger than swap (NO)
- LVs in the VG to use no more than 43G (no, but that was an
Ubuntu-only option anyhow)
So despite the max partition size of root and swap, all of the LVM is
used. And to the vast majority by swap (~516G). Which is unexpected:
a) Why is swap larger than root, despite smaller minimal and smaller priority?
b) Why is all of the VG used up, even though the preseed values say
that only ~43GB should be used at most (41GB for root and 2GB for
swap)?
So, this is essentially a bug report that maximum sizes are not
adhered to and a weak feature request to support the guided_size
option Ubuntu has.
Kind regards,
Sven
