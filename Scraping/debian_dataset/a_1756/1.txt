I think GNOME Software doesn't, and Plasma Discover only displays them
as regular install-items. A feature like that would be really nice to
have though, it's maybe worth filing a feature request.

It's a warning because the data isn't completely useless (in case you
don't want to aggregate it, for example), but in general a warning
means a failed validation - to be safe, the data needs to be warning
and error free (exit-code of appstreamcli validate needs to be zero).
Debian's appstream-generator didn't reject metadata with
non-permissive licenses until August 2016 though.

Nice :-) The license restraints are annoying, but it might keep us
from trouble when mixing data with multiple different licenses in one
file.
