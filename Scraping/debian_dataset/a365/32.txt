While I can understand that dropping packages can have some effect on
other (remaining) packages, the packages we are speaking of are usually
leaf-packages or part of a relatively self-contained dependency tree.
So the consequences of dropping them are low.

I don't think so. Removal of packages doesn't tend to uncover many
bugs.
