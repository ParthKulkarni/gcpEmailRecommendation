That bug is a year old and for 0.19, not sure if it's still any relevant
for current releases, when trying to run a bootstrap build with 0.25 it's
still trying to execute cargo, but I haven't dug deeper so far:

If anyone wants to give this a shot, my llvm 4.0 and rustc 1.24 packages
for stretch are available at https://people.debian.org/~jmm/esr60/
