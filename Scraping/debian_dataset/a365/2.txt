Alternatively: Do what is possible for me, to keep the software
I like to use in Debian. (It's the same with Python modules: I
don't use pip, but package them.)
Using browser extensions from some untrusted third party without 
any idea whether they comply with the rules of my OS (e.g. DFSG)
is not a tempting idea for me.

There is no (huge) problem, if an extension needs an update.
We can update it then. The switch from XUL to WebExtension
is an exception, because some extensions break completely
(= for ever). I don't think, this will happen again soon.
