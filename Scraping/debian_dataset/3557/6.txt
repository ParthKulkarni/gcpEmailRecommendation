You haven't seen anyone mention it because it is nonsense. The acronym
is also close to 'slats', 'slits', and 'slots', not to mention 'salts',
'stilts', and who knows how many other words in the English language.
If we are going to start applying this sort of logic to naming, then
there are plenty of other places (e.g., where actual vulgarities are
used in package names, where abreviations and/or acronyms create words
that are or can be perceived as offensive, etc.).
