Given this is a Python package, we should not even have to argue about
package relationships. Setuptools metadata provides install_requires
and extras_require, the former mapping to Depends, the latter to
Suggests. Period.
Your typical Python project README would instruct users to install the
Python package via `pip install`. If one runs `pip install networkx`,
the graphics dependencies do not get pulled. That alone is enough to
justify that these dependencies should not go to Recommends.
FYI, I have a similar problem with sympy (#861741), which pulls an
insane amount of packages via chained Recommends.
