Browserify takes code from npm (targetted at Node) and makes it run
in the browser. Node comes with an API of its own that is not available
in browsers. Browserify provides this code. There is nothing to patch
since browserify is not a direct user of this code. It exposes it to
modules that are unaware they are running in a browser.
