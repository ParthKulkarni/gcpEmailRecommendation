Now this is a new low.
Let's skip the talk about bogus descriptions for a bit, there's a bigger
problem here: the package doesn't do _anything_ it is supposed to do, just
returns error on every call.  What's the point of having it in the archive?
It changes the usual node.js principle from "do one thing and do it wrong"
to "just fail".
I hope you do know you can patch the code, including the import line?
If a dependency is not needed, it's far better to get rid of it than to
package and pull in a non-functional stub.
A stub is useful when it's an alternative the user can replace; here you
have it as a hard-coded dependency.  Please patch it out instead.
Meow!
