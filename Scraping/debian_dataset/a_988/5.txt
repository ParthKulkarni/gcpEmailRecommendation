Does this mean that this is a polyfill/compatibility shim for
running JavaScript designed for node.js in non-node.js environments
like browsers?
If so, I can't help wondering why you would ever package that
module specifically for consumption by node.js - that sounds a bit like
a JavaScript equivalent of packaging python-backports-abc (a backport
of Python 3's abc module to Python 2, [1]) and deciding to give it a
python3-backports-abc binary package for completeness. But even more
so, since this is a source package dedicated to node, not just a binary
package...
*Surely* patching packages that (think they) require this module
to not require it is less work than maintaining yet another package
for multiple years?
