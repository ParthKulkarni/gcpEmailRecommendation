Description: Node.js library which converts bytes to larger units (kB)
 This component of Node.js implements a suite of functions which
 converts bytes to larger si units with rounding. You are
 unlikely to want to install this library by itself.
 .
 For example, 1337 is converted to 1.34kB
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.

Description: Node.js library which implements a test of an object-ness
 This component of Node.js implements a function "isObj" which tests
 whether its argument is an object or not. You are unlikely to want to
 install this package by itself.
 .
  const isObj = require('is-obj');
  isObj({foo: 'bar'}); // true
  isObj([1, 2, 3]); // true
  isObj('foo'); // false
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
For example.
