The users of the library being programmers does not mean the users of
the _package_ will be programmers. If I'm installing packages during a
site wide upgrade I am going to examine the packages that get pulled in
as well as the ones I specifically install. Descriptions help greatly in
this regard. The target audience of packages in Debian are Debian users,
not necessarily just those who are developers
