Thanks, Philip, for raising this concern.  I agree with it.

...and I agree that the issue is not specific to node-* packages, but I 
find it is quite common there.  Quite likely due to recent inclusion of 
lots of packages, prepared semi-automated - as Philip pointed out very 
well.

It seems you argue that package descriptions need not make sense beyond 
the package section they belong to.  I disagree, and it seems Debian 
Policy disagrees too - see Â§ 3.4:
