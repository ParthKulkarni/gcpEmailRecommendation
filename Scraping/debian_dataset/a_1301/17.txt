This is going to have unintended consequences; for example, if we base
it on Debian Section fields, library source packages that build a
binary package containing tools, that are (incorrectly) put into the
libs section, will not be found by users.

How would you propose to implement that? apt currently doesn't have
enough metadata about packages to say if they are end-user tools or
not, and it depends on the user which tools are acceptable. For
example; some folks can deal with the command-line but the majority of
humanity cannot, some folks dislike particular GUI toolkits, etc.
