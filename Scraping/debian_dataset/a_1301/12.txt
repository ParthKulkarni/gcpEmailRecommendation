Vast majority of users would only install this via dependencies. It's hardly
a node-specific problem that debian package searches output large amount of
packages that are not useful unless you happen to be a programmer.
The only people installing node libs directly would be node developers,
for whom matching description with upstream project is valuable. If the
description is not useful for developer either ( for example 
"Itty bitty little widdle twinkie pinkie" ), better propose the upstream
project a more concise description, than to carry extra delta in debian.
