fully seconded, after reading #850399 (no description at all) and #850398
and #850397 just now (and many similar useless descriptions before), I'm
really curious for your answers to Philip's question above.
   Are you paying these people for their efforts?
 
   Are we supposed to expect them to remain interested in these packages
   when the money dries up?
 
   If not, what is the plan for providing maintenance for these packages
   for the time that they are going to be in stable?
Please elaborate.

cheers,
