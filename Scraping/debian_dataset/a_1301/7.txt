If ever something like this does go through, would it be possible to
limit it to UIDs != 0?  Eg: Hiding lib packages would be limited to
'apt-cache search' called as a non-root user without using sudo.

Isn't this something the "GNOME Software" application addresses?
Additionally, thought I'm at least two years out of date with
packagekit news/status/frustrations, I wonder if it already has one
half of a distro-agnostic method to implement this...
