Remaking the hashes in the dscs on a few packages isn't going to fix the much 
wider signature problem, unfortunately. You're always going to have an 
exciting selection of signatures on both old and new packages that are hard to 
work with for the reasons already enumerated.
Without knowing your workflow for importing packages, does not the Sources 
index provide better and most importantly, signed information?

Ahh... and I  take it that's not configurable in dak. So reuploading the 
packages would solve half the problem (hashes) but not the other half 
(signatures).
