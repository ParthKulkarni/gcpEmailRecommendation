I do require them in Debian derivatives (Tanglu / PureOS) and .dsc
files without the up-to-date signatures are quite a pain to handle. I
was already thinking about ways to mitigate this problem without
sacrificing security, but to do so would be quite some effort.
(Admittedly, updating the Debian packages will be too, but that way we
will also filter out unmaintained packages)
IMHO the bugs don't need to be RC, but it would be absolutely amazing
to have the checksums available in .dsc files too. Which means that
this has to be RC at some point (but maybe not directly before the
freeze).

If you mirror Debian's archive into dak again, this becomes a problem,
since dak (for good reason) will not import packages with weak
checksums, so re-importing source packages is a challenge.
