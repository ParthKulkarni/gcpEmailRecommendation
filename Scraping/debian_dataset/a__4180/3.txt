Thanks. Works for me. Debian Stretch. Before that I had to remove
openchrome.so. I put that content as
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-openchrome.conf and now it works fine.
For the record, the hardware in question:
00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VX855/VX875 Chrome 9 HCM Integrated Graphics (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
	Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. VX855/VX875 Chrome 9 HCM Integrated Graphics
	Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
	Memory at d8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
	Memory at de000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
	[virtual] Expansion ROM at 000c0000 [disabled] [size=128K]
	Capabilities: [60] Power Management version 2
	Capabilities: [90] MSI: Enable- Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit-
Debian packaging:
I would appreciate it if the Debian package could include such a file
(if it is harmless) or at least as an example. Or find a way to avoid
the extra configuration.
