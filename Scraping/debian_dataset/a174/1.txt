I agree the discussion degenerated, which is the reason I try rehash 
with emphasis in the subject line: I seek opinions on the sanity in 
Debian package descriptions including paragraphs solely about non-free 
*replacement* of the packaged code.

Believe what? Please let us not degenerate the discussion again!

DFSG and Social Contract do not explicitly forbid us to mention my 
birthday in long descriptions either, even if that would be irrelevant 
for most if not all package descriptions as well.

That section might relate to a degenerated discussion, but does not 
really apply to packages mentioning in their package description 
services *that* *are* *not* *needed* *at* *all* *for* *any* *use* *of* 
*said* *package* - it is only rguably needed for supporting the 
existance of the package through creating a revenue stream for the 
upstream author of it.
