Let me you remember DFSG number 9 [1]:
* License Must Not Contaminate _Other_ Software
    The license must not place restrictions on other software that is
    distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the
    license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the
    same medium must be free software.
And also point you to my previous answer to Dmitry:
 https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2017/03/msg00042.html
Shipping a collection of software on a DVD doesn't make any of this
pieces of software a derivative works one of the other.
