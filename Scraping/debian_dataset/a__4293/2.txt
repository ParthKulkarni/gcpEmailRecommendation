I installed the system using a serial console from an Ubuntu 16.04 box 
using picocom and GNOME Terminal.  I also used this Ubuntu box for 
downloading and manipulating boot images.
The critical line seems to be "** Unable to read file vmlinuz **". 
Indeed, there's no file called "vmlinuz" on the SD card.  I tried to copy 
on the "vmlinuz" from images/netboot, but that failed:
I deleted the partition from the SD card, created a bigger one, and 
installed the contents of the partition image and the vmlinuz file 
referenced above.  This booted successfully.
The first question was a little odd, asking me to select a language for 
the installation process, with a choice between "English" and "C".  There 
wasn't any clear explanation of what "C" meant.
Thereafter, everything went well until the reboot after installation. 
First, the console started emitting "C" characters a few times per second, 
which makes me think of XMODEM.  Maybe I accidentally typed something at 
the wrong moment while putting the MicroSD card away.  Anyway, afterwards 
the GNOME Terminal through which I was installing got stuck in the DEC 
Graphics character set, requiring me to disconnect picocom and run "reset" 
before I could get a useful display from the BeagleBone's console.
Other than those two problems, everything went very well, and the 
installation experience was as smooth as on a PC.
