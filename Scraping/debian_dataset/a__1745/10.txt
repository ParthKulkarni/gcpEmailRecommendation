I don't have a problem with waiting for slow machines. I just think this
shows that the decisions what becomes a release architecture and what
doesn't isn't purely meritocratic.

Well, the hardware is usually build like tanks and if people keep using
it and others keep maintaining it, why throw something out when it's
still working?
SAP is still maintaining and supporting JDK on PA-RISC and IA64
for paying customers, FWIW.

Jason Duerstock talked to him and he said, he's still doing this as
a job at Intel because basically no one told him to stop doing it.

Yes, this is being worked on. There are FPGA-based implementations which
allow to boost Amiga and Atari hardware to considerably higher speeds. It's
not done on a large commercial scale, so things take longer to develop.
But people are working on it and bugs get fixed, code maintained and
drivers added.

Well, I have had people from IBM fix 32-bit PowerPC code. There is naturally
more involvement behind the 64-bit stuff because that's where the commercial
interests are.

That's a compiler bug, I know.

What Oracle is really doing and planning isn't really clear. I have talked
to multiple people at Oracle directly and the consensus is that there isn't
a consensus what is going to happen next.
But again, this just supports my point that the decisions which ports
become release architectures is mostly driven by commercial interests
and not whether there are users in the community. Or is there actually
a large community of POWER8 and z-Series Debian users?

I think the problem that I have is that the release qualifications are
not practical in the sense that they don't necessarily meet our users
expectations. As I said, I think a tier-based system would be more
practical as it would allow ports to be degraded more gracefully instead
of just kicking them out like it was done with 32-Bit PowerPC.
I don't have a proper concept yet, but I think the OBS approach is more
versatile, for example.
