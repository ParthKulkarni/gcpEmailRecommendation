It's been a long time since Debian could run infrastructure on donated
hardware.  We need hardware that is reliable and that can be quickly
replaced when (not if) it fails.  So commercial availability is, and
should continue to be, a release qualification.
It is also unacceptable that the release of an urgent security update
should have to wait a long time for builds.  So speed matters.

Could you be more specific?
