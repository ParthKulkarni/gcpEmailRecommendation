Yeah, but that 7% figure I noted is an already very optimistic number for a
typical task.  A good part of programs (like shell scripts) show 0%, and
there are some that are actually slower (impossible in theory, but there are
missed optimizations which work on mainstream ABIs).
So an user would have to evaluate every single use case to see whether it's
worth the effort.  In the only case I know where such an evaluation was
meant for a real cluster, the guy who asked me decided that "no".

Right -- as I haven't done any x32 fixes recently, it's not up to me to
decide.  I'm just voicing me having been an active porter in the past but
then getting disheartened by the lack of use.
You might also want to take the domain debian-x32.org from me.  Not sure how
useful jessie era packages (including d-i which never got upstreamed) will
be after buster...
On the other hand, x32 is not a shut case, hardware that can run it being
ubiquitous.  Archs like sh4 whose entire reason to exist ("a fully free
architecture") got eaten by riscv and that have no meaningful presence in
the wild, on the other hand...
Meow!
