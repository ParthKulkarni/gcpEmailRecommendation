Could you please describe what you mean?  All 64-bit Debian
architectures are LP64.  So building a single binary using ILP64 will
even break the ABI for glibc and it will most likely not run very far.
(A file descriptor is defined as "int", so even the most basic file
calls will be incompatible.)
So I assume you mean something different than ILP64.  I also found no
option in gcc to change this part of the ABI, but I have not looked very
far.
Regards,
Bastian
