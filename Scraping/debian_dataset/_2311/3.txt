By "the iso image", you mean... ?

The images team doesn't make the _netboot_ image - that comes straight
out of the d-i build.
So... the path to the current buster netboot image also points to the
same d-i build (20181206) that was used for the d-i alpha 4
netinst/CD/DVD build. From my local mirror:
lrwxrwxrwx  1 mirror users    8 Dec  6 19:08 current -> 20181206
But... The problem you're most likely seeing is caused by a simple
fact. The *netboot* image ends up downloading significant chunks of
the installer and the base system at runtime from the suite it
targets. For buster, that is still very much a moving target and it's
likely to already have incompatibilities with the released 20181206
netboot image.
Netboot images are *only* useful and safe when they exactly match the
state of the Debian release they're targeting. That's either a stable
release, or within a couple of days of the build happening if you're
looking at testing.
For any other purposes, IMHO you're massively better off using a
_netinst_ image instead. Or install stable and upgrade.
Hope that helps!
