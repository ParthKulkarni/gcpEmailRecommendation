Thanks for your answer, Len!
I am sorry for having caused confusion. Actually, I only wanted to
report a bug for the problems encountered during the installation on the
Toshiba laptop. I know that virtualbox won't be in Debian Stretch, so
therefore I don't want to report this bug. As you can read in the
mailing-list entries I tried it with the latest virtualbox version
without success. Unfortunately, I used Oracle's repository, not the one
in jessie-backports. Actually, I don't know whether or not I am going to
try that. I think I will move to qemu since it is completely open
source.
