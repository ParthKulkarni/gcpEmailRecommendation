It seems that the X or Wayland server is not starting because something
is wrong with a graphics driver.  gdm will try to start it several
times before giving up.  This can cause the blinking that you see.  Try
switching to another VT (e.g. press Alt-F2).  You should get a text
login prompt that you can use to start a shell.
You should be able to find some information about what went wrong with
this command:
    sudo grep gdm /var/log/messages
I hope you can work out how to copy that text into a file and then an
email; if not then ask about this on debian-user.

You need to log in (as explained above), enable non-free packages (see
https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList), and install the firmware-amd-
graphics package.  Then you should probably reboot.
Alternately, reinstall using an installer built with non-free firmware
included:
