I have been thinking for a while of starting a new packaging team for
desktop themes (especially GTK+ and GNOME themes since so many
desktops can use them).
I guess one of the larger requirements is that there be a team mailing
list to fill in the Maintainer field.
Now that Alioth is beginning to close down and its replacement is not
yet ready, how would I start this team now?
Thanks,
