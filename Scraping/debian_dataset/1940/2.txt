Hi Alexander,
Thanks for your on-going work on alioth and its replacement.

This has come up a couple of times but with little explanation and the lack 
of information is going to lead to wild and perhaps inaccurate speculation. 
I appreciate that you're waiting until the alioth replacement is ready 
before you announce it, but in the absence of information, incorrect 
extrapolations are being made.
Is there some other mode of interaction that the new-alioth provides that 
will replace the existing mailing lists as a way for users and maintainer 
teams to communicate to discuss development, bugs and provide support?
thanks
Stuart
