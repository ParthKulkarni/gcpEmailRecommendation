While I agree with the gist of your message, I don't think picking out
single points out of guidelines to make an isolated point is fair to
these guidelines. They make a point in aggregate. For instance if you
allow easily guessable passwords, you need at least sensible rate
limiting in place (e.g. 5.2.2 - "When required by the authenticator type
descriptions in Section 5.1, the verifier SHALL implement controls to
protect against online guessing attacks.").
I think something around security needs being different from context to
context and depending on that deciding on a password shape could make
sense. It seems to me that today at least the guidance of mixed
character classes still makes some sense as a default, to avoid the most
obvious blunder of just using a simple dictionary word and be
compromised over SSH because password authentication is turned on. And
change it to make brute force attacks harder.
Of course in any kind of company context I would despise *rules* (which
this comment is not - it's just a suggestion) because they lower security.
Kind regards
