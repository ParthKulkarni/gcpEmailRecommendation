I'd say it's one of two things: If it's easy, make sure to change it
periodically. If it's hard enough to withstand brute-force, you don't
need to.
As I said: I'm totally with you that in a standard setup it'd great for
that not to be necessary. Unfortunately the standard setup does not ship
with the mitigating controls.
Kind regards
