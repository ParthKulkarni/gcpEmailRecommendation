Hi all,
This is a short note to say that Christoph (CCed) and I are taking over
packaging of Busybox in Debian. I'm hoping that we will both be fairly
active in here (the busybox mailing list) from now on.
We've got a lot of work to do to update Busybox in Debian to a more
modern version, triage bugs, tidy things up and basically make the
Debian package look alive again. Please bear with us, this won't be a
quick process.
In the mean time, please let us know if you have any questions.
Cheers,
Chris
