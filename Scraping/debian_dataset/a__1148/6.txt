If you're using git-buildpackage, using cowbuilder is indistinguishable
from using pbuilder (in fact, someone may well be using cowbuilder and not
know it if they used the default recommendations in git-buildpackage).
cowbuilder is nearly identical to pbuilder; it just constructs the work
directory for the build differently, in a way that at least used to be way
faster.
