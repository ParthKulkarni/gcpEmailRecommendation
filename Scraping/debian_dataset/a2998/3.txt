That would be ideal.Â  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help with the 
effort there.Â  This is a problem I've come across before and likely will again.Â  
I'd prefer to contribute to a more durable and public solution rather than just 
finding a quick workaround.
I will likely follow up on jhcha54008's work at 
https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2017/12/msg00375.html and I'll post back 
here if I come up with anything useful.
Thanks,
Alex
