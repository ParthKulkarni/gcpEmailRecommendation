I'm not sure I understand your question exactly, but if you want to toy
with other fonts than what's currently used depending on the language,
have a look at the rootskel-gtk package.
It provides gtk-set-font, which you can tweak, either at runtime (easy
but not persistent), or in the rootskel-gtk source package (but then
you'll need to rebuild d-i to include it, using build/localudebs).
