Thanks.
Is it documented somewhere how to use rootskel-gtk to loop through 
multiple locales making screendumps for each locale?  Or anything 
similar, automated, which I might use as starting point?
I am not familiar with working interactively with debian-installer. 
which seems a requirement (apparently rootskel exist as udeb only). 
That's why I prefer something scripted as starting point that I can 
adapt for my experiments of replacing fonts.
What would be ideal for me as starting point is something like this:

(as mentioned previously, above specificall seems to be obsolete.)
