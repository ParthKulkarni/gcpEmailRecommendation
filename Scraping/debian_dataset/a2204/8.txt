Hi Baptiste,

Well, I can understand the argument, but the user could very well expect
disks to be in mirror mode as soon as possible, and not wait until a few
days after the installation before the initial sync ends…

I'm not sure it would be a good idea to stick a hardcoded value there,
even if we were to lower the available bandwidth… Too many different
cases, be it about actual hardware, disk sizes, etc.
