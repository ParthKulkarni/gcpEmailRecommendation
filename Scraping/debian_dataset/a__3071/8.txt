Sorry if you found my message a bit rude, I appreciate the work you are
doing and I even encouraged you to try it out because clearly nobody
was assuming the task. But honestly there have been way too many uploads
with regressions, you should spend more time thinking about the
consequences of each change and you should really add some automated test
to catch the regressions.
I understand the "release early, release often" mantra, but here we are
speaking of an important tool that we really to keep working at any time.
Cheers,
