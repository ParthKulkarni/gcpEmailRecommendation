In this case automated regression testing would only have found it if
derivatives would've been tested for.
Unfortunately while I tried to anticipate the fallout here in [1] I also
did not get an answer to my question. I guess I would've needed to be
more clear in wanting a debdiff between the two udebs because that's
usually how things are reviewed in Debian land - and just reviewing
changes to the source does not convey the same information.
At work we have code review tooling that shows you the change in data
(sadly not in .debs either). I wonder if something similar of "build
package at origin and at target and diff the two" exists.
But that would still require some culture of timely reviews and the
requester waiting until that review is done. Right now merge requests
for d-i won't really work for contributors who already have commit
access because there are two few people who are actually willing to
review - and others actively unassign themselves. I understand why that
is, but at the same time we then need to attenuate our feedback.
Anticipating the consequences requires a certain familiarity that new
contributors don't have. Still automatic pre-release testing is
something very useful.
Kind regards
