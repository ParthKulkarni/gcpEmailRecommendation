Britney generates a machine-readable format that should be useful for
solving this issue. The data file is updated hourly and available from:
https://release.debian.org/britney/excuses.yaml
(Pull between HH:45 - HH:59 if you want the least latency)
You are looking for:
"""
  item-name: gdcm
  [...]
  policy_info:
    age:
      age-requirement: 5
      current-age: 0
      verdict: REJECTED_TEMPORARILY
    autopkgtest:
      camitk/4.0.4-2:
        amd64:
        - ALWAYSFAIL
        - https://ci.debian.net/data/autopkgtest/[...]
        - https://ci.debian.net/packages/c/camitk/testing/amd64
        - null
        - null
      [...]
"""
Where:
 * item-name is the updated source that (potentially) introduces an
   issue
 * policy_info.autopkgtest.dgit/<version> (if present) is the test
   result for dgit.  In this structure ($RESULT), you are looking for
   $RESULT.${ARCH}[0] which contains the test result for dgit on that
   architecture.
   - Please see [the source] for known status labels
