clone 879145 -1
retitle -1 backports support
thanks
Thank you for your answer. I can understand that you prioritize
backports support. Perhaps we should open a different bug report 
to keep track of the discussion about backports support ?
debian-ports supports seems comparatively easier : there is no
udeb package overlap between the two suites 'unstable' and 'unreleased',
as far as I can see. Some packages in 'unreleased' are arch-specific 
to a non released architecture - and so not in 'unstable'. And the
other packages didn't make their way to 'unstable' because they FTBFS -
modified versions were uploded to 'unreleased'.
Bonne fin d'année à tous !
Regards,
JH Chatenet
