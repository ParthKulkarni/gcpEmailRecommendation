Hi,

We still haven't managed to get around to merging support for backports
over the past few years, but I'd slightly prefer if we could merge it
first.
I only have a vague recollection, but ISTR net-retriever was only able
to perform installations from a single source, and I had to implement
merging Packages files from stable and stable-backports, which I don't
see in your proposed patch.
