https://manpages.debian.org has been modernized! We have just launched
a major update to our manpage repository. What used to be served via a
CGI script is now a statically generated website, and therefore
blazingly fast.
While we were at it, we have restructured the paths so that we can
serve all manpages, even those whose name conflicts with other binary
packages (e.g. crontab(5) from cron, bcron or systemd-cron). Don’t
worry: the old URLs are redirected correctly.
Furthermore, the design of the site has been updated and now includes
navigation panels that allow quick access to the manpage in other
Debian versions, other binary packages, other sections and other
languages. Speaking of languages, the site serves manpages in all
their available languages and respects your browser’s language when
redirecting or following a cross-reference.
Much like the Debian package tracker, manpages.debian.org includes
packages from Debian oldstable, oldstable-backports, stable,
stable-backports, testing and unstable. New manpages should make their
way onto manpages.debian.org within a few hours.
The generator program (“debiman”) is open source and can be found at
https://github.com/Debian/debiman. In case you would like to use it to
run a similar manpage repository (or convert your existing manpage
repository to it), we’d love to help you out; just send an email to
stapelberg AT debian DOT org.
This effort is standing on the shoulders of giants: check out
https://manpages.debian.org/about.html for a list of people we thank.
We’d love to hear your feedback and thoughts. Either contact us via an
issue on https://github.com/Debian/debiman/issues/, or send an email
to the debian-doc mailing list (see
https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/).
