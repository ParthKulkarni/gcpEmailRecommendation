Most services don't do that. Which is also related to the fact that they 
wouldn't run the code from stable but the machines need to run stable to 
be supportable by our awesome sysadmins. So you'd need to go and 
backport the package. The development cycle would then mean test 
$somewhere with an unstable environment, upload to unstable, wait for it 
to migrate to testing, backport it, test it on stable, notice a bug, 
rinse and repeat...
Kind regards
