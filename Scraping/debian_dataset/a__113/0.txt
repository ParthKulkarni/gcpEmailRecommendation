FYI, this page isn't maintained by Debian so we can't fix it. You
might want to leave a comment on the page.

Anyone can do that on their own systems quite simply (manually update
/etc/passwd, rename the directory) but I expect that doing this by
default would break some folks automation and more folks expectations
about the default root user home directory.

If we called / the base directory and /root the root user home
directory, would that help? If you can find any Debian documentation
where this is discussed then we can clarify it, but the page you
linked to isn't maintained by Debian.
