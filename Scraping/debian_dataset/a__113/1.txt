You are not suggesting nonsense.  However, both uses of the term root
have been around since the very beginning of Unix, about 1969 or 1970, I
think.  Both uses are so deeply entrenched in the *nix culture that
neither will ever be changed.  New users just have to learn to
disambiguate this term from context.  The explanation in the Debian file
system page is, I presume, an attempt to help educate newcomers about
this ambiguity.
