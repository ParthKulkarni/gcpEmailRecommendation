Running this same command works just fine here. 
If 'unxz' from xz-utils is found, then the .xz version is used; bunzip2 will 
similarly be tried (but isn't on the mirror) and then gunzip is searched for 
and the .gz file is used.
From debootstrap.log:
Resolving debian.usu.edu (debian.usu.edu)... 129.123.104.15

And stracing:

Removing xz-utils, strace shows:
execve("/usr/bin/wget", ["wget", "-O", "Â«tmpdirÂ»/mini/var/lib/apt/lists/
partial/debian.usu.edu_debian_dists_stretch_main_binary-amd64_Packages.gz",

That is what is supposed to happen (and does for me). Is it possible that you 
somehow do not have unxz and gunzip available in PATH? 
I see that you've created this bug report without using reportbug and from 
what looks like a non-Debian system -- is the version against which you have 
reported this bug incorrect? Is there additional information you can provide?
Cheers
Stuart
