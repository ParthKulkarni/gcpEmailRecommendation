1.5~alpha2 fixes a critical security issue for people that set
a custom CaInfo option: Alpha 1 always loaded the system-wide CA
store, now only the custom one is loaded.
As another notable change, you can now use the http method for
tor+https, just set Dir::Bin::Methods::tor+https to "http".
Also SRV support now properly uses the port specified in the
SRV response, not the original port (there will be a stable
update for that).
