Hi,

yes, because sbuild-createchroot has nothing to do with cross-compiling.
chroots that you use to compile natively or cross with sbuild are exactly the
same. That's why creating a chroot for cross compilation is no different from
creating a chroot for native compilation.
To cross compile with sbuild, you give it the --build and --host arguments on
the command line. It will then pick the right chroot for you but that chroot
does not need to have anything special in it.
Thanks!
cheers, josch
