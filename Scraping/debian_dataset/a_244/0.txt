What I saw were the dates october 12 and october 14, no retransmits.
Qualify that as "unanswered" is to me being impatient.

Yes, talk to our FTP peers, Filtering The Packages peers.
Allow them time to respond[1].
When _your_ time-out is reached, send your message again.
Add something like "I missed your response, hence this retransmit".
Nothing more, focus on the original request.
Stay away from dispuuts about replies within N days.
