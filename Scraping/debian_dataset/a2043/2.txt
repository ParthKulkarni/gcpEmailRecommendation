Is there a mechanism to insure that when packages are removed from a repo
are reflected in netboot.tar.gz?
IOW: Is there a way to guarantee that
(dist)/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz does not
contain a kernel that has no modules package IN THAT SAME mirror?
 
Or maybe even an automated way to update netboot.tar.gz every time a
dists linux-image-(arch).deb is updated, a new netboot.tar.gz can be
created from (dist)/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz?
