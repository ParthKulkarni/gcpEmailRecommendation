The python3-*-dbg package contain not only the debug symbols for the extension
built for the normal interpreter, but also the (unstripped) extensions for the
debug interpreter.
There are also some library packages which ship pretty printer files (-gdb.py)
in the shared library package or the -dbg package.  Some maintainers now modify
the dbgsym packages to include these files into the dbgsym package.
