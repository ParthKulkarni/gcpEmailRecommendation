I have sympathy too, because I take time every day to try and help people 
solve issues like this.  I admire the effort to get this wifi issue 
resolved.  I just think it would be smart to mull it over a bit.  
I know it's been a long time coming, and from what I can tell, debian is 
getting better with every release.  We're going to hit the bullseye, I 
really believe that.
Brute forcing this thing with wifi to /e/n/i might not be the best 
approach?  What about people who want a different config than the 
installer?  What about people who don;t want to be UP (auto) on bootup?  
What about static configs?  Wifi is by nature a mobile environment, what 
about security or several devices?  Let's help the devs by hashing out the 
pros and cons and making a coherent proposal?
Thanks again,
