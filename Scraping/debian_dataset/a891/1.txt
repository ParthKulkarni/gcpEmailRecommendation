Definitely not under .config, for the same reasons it would be wrong
for those to go under /etc.
From the XDG Base Dir spec, the thing that's somewhat closest is
$XDG_DATA_HOME with a default of $HOME/.local/share. But that spec is
lacking in many places, and a missing .local/bin and .local/lib are
among those.
There are the logical extensions for those at
<https://theos.kyriasis.com/~kyrias/basedir-spec.html>, but
unfortunately nothing seems to refer to XDG_LIB_HOME on sources.d.o. :(
Thanks,
