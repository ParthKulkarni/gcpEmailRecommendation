Source: iso-scan
Version: 1.57
Severity: wishlist
Tags: patch
When you use an ISO image stored on a disk, it makes it impossible to
re-use that disk in the installation process (e.g. for automatic
partitioning).
In order to avoid this limitation, I would like iso-scan to be able
to copy the ISO image into RAM and to mount it from there. The attached
patch implements precisely when the debconf question "iso-scan/copy_iso_to_ram"
returns true.
It would be nice to see this merged (the patch applies cleanly on top
of the one in #868859, but you can also merge it separately if you drop
the changelog entry).
Let me know if there's anything to improve before it's ready to be merged
(notably on the debconf template, etc.).
Cheers,

Subject: [PATCH] Offer possibility to copy ISO to RAM before mount
The iso-scan/copy_iso_to_ram debconf question controls this new
feature. It defaults to false for backwards compatibility and also
because it can only be safely enabled when the amount of RAM is
sufficient to host a full copy of the image.
