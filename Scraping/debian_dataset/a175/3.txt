That's not true; you are incorrect in thinking that exhausts the common
uses of that information. For example:
> If you want to contact the maintainer you need internet access
With the maintainer email address, I do not need internet access to
compose an email message. Without that information I can't.
> if you want to visit the upstream homepage you need internet access
With the upstream home page URL, I do not need internet access to
bookmark a URL. Without that URL I can't.

So, there are plenty of uses for information that do not require
internet access *at the time of using* the information.
Yes, some uses do require internet access; that doesn't eliminate all
usefulness of the information.
So, I concur with Guillem: This information is closely tied to the
source package, and the source package becomes less useful (lack of
imagination notwithstanding :-) by taking that information away from the
source package.
There may be good arguments for removing that information from the
source package. But let's dispose now of the ‚Äúit's no use‚Äù claim;
that's simply false, so some other justification will be needed.
