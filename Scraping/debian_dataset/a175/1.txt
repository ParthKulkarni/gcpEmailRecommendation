Or rather lintian reflects the current status that was forced by the
Alioth to Salsa migration.  May be somebody can explain me in very
simple words why we can not point anonscm.d.o to salsa.d.o once Alioth
is shut down.

*We expect you to fix* is some quite unusual wording that's very rarely
used on this list.

While I'm especially thanking you for this service (and the Salsa
migration in general) I feel really shy if you say it was done
"especially" for me.  I consider the wording "motivated by a mail of
mine" more appropriate considering the facts:

Your mail sounds a bit like you are tired from the migration so once
again:  I'm very happy about all the good work the migration team did so
far.  Unfortunately I have somehow met a sore point with the anonscm.d.o
redirection which is not intended.  I'm just not that happy to reupload
close to 1000 packages[1] when not understanding the technical need for
doing this.
My personal policy is:  I will not change Vcs fields until cme is doing
this for me and I do not give up the hope that some redirect will be
possible.
Kind regards
     Andreas.
