.... which IMO proves that a sophisticated "layout" with namespaces or
subdirs is a bad idea for canonical URLs.
Why can't we have a flat name space with redirection
https://git.debian.org/<package>
(or similar) that just redirects to the proper real location within salsa?
Our source package names are unique, so there should be no conflicts.
That would make the discovery of a certain package *much* easier than
the current structured approach.
