IMO it would be better to abolish Uploaders in favour of fixing the
original spec bug in Maintainers.  Also, easier, because as a
practical matter, there is a lot of software that will fail if it
fails to find a Maintainer field but won't really mind what it
contains.
Please go ahead and push this.  Last time I tried to fix it, there
were too many objections and the whole thing was obviously too much
hard work.
