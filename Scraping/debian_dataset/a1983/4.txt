That doesn't demonstrate the point you claim above that it makes.  That
change was just a renaming.
The previous state was that doc/changelog (for the debian-manuals
package of the time, which later became debian-policy) was installed as
"changelog.manuals" in the binary, and debian/changelog was installed as
"changelog.dpkg"; after this change, there was still a
"changelog.manuals" but debian/changelog was now installed as
"changelog" installed.  But there were two files both before and after
that change.
In any case, that wasn't a typical matter of an upstream changelog vs.
Debian changelog, but more like two separate packages that were managed
as part of the same source tree but had independent changelogs.
