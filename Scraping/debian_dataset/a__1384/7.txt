Why does that talk about building from the git repository, rather than
a source package (which duplicates the instructions at
https://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html)?
For cross-building generally you should use the 'cross' build profile. 
And for linux specifically you can also use the 'pkg.linux.notools'
build profile to disable the userland packages, which greatly reduces
the build depdendencies.
