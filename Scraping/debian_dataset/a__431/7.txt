Yes, but that's obviously not how Debian works. If you want to get this
fix into Stretch, you have to convince the release managers and/or the
Debian maintainer for mc that the bug is problematic enough that either
backporting the fix for that bug, or updating the package to the new
version, is worth it in spite of our release policy.
Whether that is the case for this particular bug isn't entirely clear.
This is a pretty annoying issue; but from reading the bug report that
you filed upstream, it doesn't feel like it's something that occurs in
the default configuration. It requires a judgement call, which is for
the maintainer and/or the release managers to make.
