Hi,
Sorry for the late reply, busy over the holiday season.

Even more reason not to enable it if desktops are already catered for.

But it also provides a completely false sense of security as in "Debian takes
care of this by default, no need to bother".

Possibly, yes.

unattended-upgrades is a crude hack at best, it's _not_ suitable for a default
installation. There might be scenarios where it's fine to apply (e.g.
in some test/staging environment or a desktop where breakage is acceptable and
where people can install unattended-upgrades), but not for Debian installations
per se.
It also totally changes the dynamics from "Debian releases updates and it's
my responsibility to test and deploy them within the parameters of my setup"
to "updates are installed by default and the inevitable random regression 
broke our systems, it's Debian's fault".
Providing security support for the biggest distro on a volunteer basis
is complex enough, no need for unattended-upgrades to interfere further.

Random mailing discussions are not a useful consensus building mechanism,
most of us don't follow them on a timely basis. This primarily affects the
Security Team and such changes need to be brought to the attention of
team@security.debian.org
