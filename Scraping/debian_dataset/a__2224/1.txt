The use of "you" is, I would say, tolerated. What we tried to avoid
(at least when I was a PITA for people wanting to introduce new
templates) was what I called "personnalization" of the computer :
"your machine", for instance. Everything that seems to impply that the
machine being installed belongs to the person who is installing it.
Addressing the user has been accepted : "you should do this", "you
need to do thaat".....
In this case, I would try avoiding to imply that the person
installingn the machine will be the person who has to review security
chnges when they happen, so I'd probably use the passive form
"Security updates should be reviewed before they are applied"......os
something like this.
But you're right : we used debian-l10n-english for reviewing
templates. If someone is still alive there, (s)he may help.
