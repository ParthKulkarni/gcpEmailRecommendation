Security updates, yes.  Automated, no.  Desktops, maybe.  Servers, no.
For my infrastructure, updates, of what ever kind, need to be incorporated into the test/build/roll-out cycle.
Unless I misunderstand the intent of this thread.
So, as an accommodation,  a flag in the preseed mechanism to enable/disable would be helpful.  But would need to be exposed in maybe the expert mode menus, which I think was already mentioned.
