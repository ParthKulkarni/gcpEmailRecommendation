Ok.
I'm ccing debian-l10n-english@lists.debian.org to have their review.
Here's the updated string that I'm now proposing based on the early
feedback:
_Description: Updates management on this system:
 Applying updates on a frequent basis is an important part of keeping the
 system secure.
 .
 By default, security updates are not automatically installed as security
 advisories should be reviewed before installation of the updates using
 standard package management tools.
 .
 Alternatively the unattended-upgrades package can be installed, it will
 install security updates automatically. Note however that automatic
 installation of updates may occasionally cause unexpected downtime of
 services provided by this machine in the rare cases where the update is
 not fully backwards compatible or when the security advisory requires the
 administrator to perform some other manual operation.
Cheers,
