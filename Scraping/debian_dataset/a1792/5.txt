Is there any reason why the following method wouldn't be an
improvement?:
1) get a list of disks
2) identify the disk used by the installer
3) exclude the disk found at #2
4) present modified list as target disks for installation
5) unless in expert mode, where a user could use one partition of a
disk as the installation source and another partition as the
installation target.  I'm not sure how important #5 is, but maybe some
users want to be able to do this?
Cheers,
