The context of this bug is that Michael wants to partition a single
disk - not set up a RAID.  I think it *is* unusual that Debian would be
installed on a single disk of a system that contains multiple internal
disks.  If someone really wants to pre-seed partman in that case then
they would have to specify the device name just as they do now
(presumably using /dev/disk/by-path/...).

That seems to defeat the point of pre-seeding.
