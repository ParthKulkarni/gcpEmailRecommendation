specifically 5.9.5.
Did you already try to contact the previous maintainer?
Are they on this list:
https://wiki.debian.org/LowThresholdAdoption
If it's been orphaned for 5 years I think you are safe to just update
and upload it, but policy says you should try to contact the previous 
maintainer to get an OK. More details are at:

The policy document and debian-mentors mailing list can help you with
packaging queries. When you have a new upload prepared you will need
to get a sponsor to upload by asking on debian-mentors.
