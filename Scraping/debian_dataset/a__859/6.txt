Or take your tag and turn it into a release; the process is even nicely
documented[0], Bill, so perhaps you should get your facts straight before
complaining about this. I don't really care, but I imagine comments like

and maintaining all the services we take for granted in the project.
Even the wiki page you linked there states that GitLab "allows extra
files to be attached to the tag".
