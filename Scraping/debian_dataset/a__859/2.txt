Can you please elaborate on what exactly is blocking those projects to
migrate right away?  I think 5 weeks is a reasonable time to do the
migration and I haven't seen any call for help from maintainers that
feel overwhelmed by the task.  I volunteer to help migrate non-Git
repositories to Git, if that can be of any help.
