I don't think there are enough people caring about ntp in Debian (or the
world) to maintain two code bases.  And the fork is still young and not
"obviously better" or "clearly the one true path forward".
See also https://lwn.net/Articles/713901/ for more background
information.
IMHO, it's very unfortunate that this fork was created, and I cannot see
anything good coming out of it.  It's just wasting developer resources
which could have been used to improve ntp.
