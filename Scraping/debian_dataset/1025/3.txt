ntpd is definitely running now, it is a default configuration and it was
already on the box a long time before I observed the issue today.
However, at the time when I ran ntpdate, ntp was not running.  I had
brought up the network manually due to an interface renaming issue on
the first boot.  Maybe when somebody runs ntpdate in a scenario like
that the kernel is not sending the new date/time to the hardware clock.
I had simply assumed that it would be persisted at shutdown but maybe
ntpdate could be patched to do whatever ntpd does to encourage the
kernel to persist it.
