Nothing in this line is intended to be a template parameter list, but it
looks like gcc has decided something is; maybe it's "hash", which the
compiler treats as std::hash due to e.g., an earlier "using" statement.
If so, consider trying
       while (pos<fCapacity && (hash[pos].hash)<0) pos++;
                               ^ parenthesize ^
so that the "<" can't introduce a template parameter list.
My mental model of the C++ grammar doesn't explain to me why the
compiler thinks this "<" can introduce a template parameter list, but
that sure seems to be what the compiler states it is doing.  Usually
when g++ and I disagree about C++ grammar, g++ is right...
