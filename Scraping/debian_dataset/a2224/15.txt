unattended-upgrades are not an appropriate default. It's okay for a desktop
system which gets powered down daily, so you can add it to tasksel lists for
desktop roles, but not enable it by default for servers.
- It does not handle restarts. If you upgrade OpenSSL (or any library) with
it, all your services will be left vulnerable until restarted. It will
give people a warm fuzzy feeling, but not any actual security benefit.
- We do need to make the occasional breaking change where people have to
modify configuration settings or perform additional manual steps. With
unattended-upgrades people don't have a chance to intervene. And if their
setups break, we're the ones who get blamed.
Why was this change made without contacting team@security.debian.org (as
the ones who are affected the most)?
