Is this synchronous, or does one also need a call to "udevadm settle"? I
had a problem with kpartx where the loop devices were not available
after the package was installed, likely because of a race. I wonder if a
feature request would make sense to integrate udev with debhelper so
that the correct snippet could be generated for various packages'
postinsts instead of everyone who ships a rules file hand-rolling it. Of
course if people actually need to write complicated rules to select the
rules to re-trigger, that seems much more difficult to do...
Kind regards
