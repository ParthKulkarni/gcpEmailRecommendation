Hi,
just to be sure, that this is not a problem:
There used to be a package "dino" in Debian until jessie.  Upstream
development dried up years ago and dino became extinct.
Recently, a new "dino" appeared on the surface of earth, which is a
completely different program. Like git vs git or node vs node, but
with only one contender.
I would package the new dino under this name, because I don't think
there is a conflict.
Any objections?
