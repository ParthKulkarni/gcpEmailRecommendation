And then you go to the bug and you see that it degenerated into a "if it
uses a non-free service, it should go into contrib" subdiscussion. Since
when do we believe that? Neither the DFSG nor the Social Contract would
imply that you need to have a free server for an API client
implementation. Now, I understand that this would be desirable and we
should encourage it but we shouldn't just move goal posts willy-nilly.
The only crucial sentence might be this one from Â§2.2.2 in the policy:
"The contrib archive area contains supplemental packages intended to
work with the Debian distribution, but which require software outside of
the distribution to either build or function."
The policy isn't something we voted upon. Do people really understand
that this means tools calling an API on the Internet would need to be in
contrib? I don't think I agree with this non-free'ization of Debian.
Stuff like licq never belonged into contrib either, despite its main
purpose back then being to connect to the ICQ (and MSN?) services.
Someone wrote a Free client implementation, hence we should offer it to
our users. I could pull other strawmans like "what about tools that
connect to the telephone network, which is non-free?". Where would we
even draw that line?
Kind regards
