Stuff like s3cmd are tools connecting to cloud services.  Arguably 
usable to have tools to free data from the clouds.
...but bug#856139 is, I believe, about a tool advertising a cloud 
service which is *not* used by the tool.  Instead that cloud service is 
advertised as an option *instead* of installing and using the Free tool.
Anyone having opinions more narrowly on that kind of advertisements?
