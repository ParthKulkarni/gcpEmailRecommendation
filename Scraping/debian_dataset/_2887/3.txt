Because there is very little benefit to this change.  It tidies things
up a bit.  But unless we actually expect to have to update the md5
implementation somehow, there is little practical purpose.
Loosening transitions like this generally makes life easier for users
and downstreams.  And our own official backports repo is only one of
our downstreams.
