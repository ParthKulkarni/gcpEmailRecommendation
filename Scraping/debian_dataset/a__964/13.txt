This is an uncharitable interpretation of the situation. There is no
deliberate witholding of information from you or any other maintainer;
I â€” and the rest of the FTP team â€” are simply busy people.
Anyway, I've processed your package. Please fix the missing attributions
to (at least) Thomas Lumley on your next upload and, if possible, think
carefully about making emotional requests on -devel in future.
Best wishes,
