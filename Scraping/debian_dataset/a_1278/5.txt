I think this makes sense: it gives the maintainer and other interested
developers some time to assess whether the failure is a showstopper
(=> upload a fix/revert/workaround, or at worst file a RC bug) or not.
Or, conversely, blocking migrations but letting the relevant maintainers
remove that block might work.

This is my concern too. If you maintain a useful package with tests that
are unstable but do not imply a release-critical issue, running those
tests and recording-but-ignoring the failures seems considerably better
for Debian than either disabling the tests or removing the software
(more information is better than less information, and if the package
is useful despite the test failure then it's better to have it than not).
Possible autopkgtest extension: "Restrictions: unreliable"?
