build/Makefile passes it to build/util/pkg-list.  It appears to be
possible to restrict packages listed in build/pkg-lists to particular
kernel major version by putting that at the end of the line:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â if ($line=~s/^(.*) \[([0-9. ]+)\]$/$1/) {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â my %kernels=();
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $kernels{$_} = 1 foreach split ' ', $2;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â return unless $kernels{$kernel_major};
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
but none of the lists do so any more.
So to get rid of KERNELMAJOR you would first need to delete this
feature and parameter from build/util/pkg-list, and check that it
behaves the same with current package lists.
