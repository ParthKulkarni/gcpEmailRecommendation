Thanks for prodding us about those changes. I'll focus on those where
I'm listed.

I'll check and upload this one.
FWIW: This package (also called dini or d-i-n-i) can't interfere with
the debian-installer build process as it actually consumes what the
src:debian-installer produces. This is mostly a bundle of everything the
various netboot* targets (in debian-installer) produce. But thanks for
asking anyway. :)

Here you should mostly see an update in various versioned dependencies,
due to the new changelog entry (0.116â†’0.117); other changes include the
bump in the libc6-udeb dependency, which happens when there's a new
glibc version; and slight differences in Installed-Size (to be ignored).
IOW: This seems safe to upload.
> Thanks and Merry Christmas to you all
Season's greetings as well. :)
Cheers,
