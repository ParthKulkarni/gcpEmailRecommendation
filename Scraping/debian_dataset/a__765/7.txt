Hi,
there are some packages with pending 'coding' changings (other than translation
changings), which we would want to be uploaded for Buster.
Since there are also pending translation changings in some of that packages, 
I would like to have uploads for those, but ask for an extra confirmation, if 
the coding changings are uncritical for me to upload.
The other possibility would be that those people (in CC) do the upload which 
made the 'coding' changings.
The relevant packages are:
cdebconf

debian-installer-netboot-images
Commits: https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer-netboot-images/commits/master
by: Cyril, Mattia
These are trivial changings, but I was unsure, if an upload could somehow 
affect build of images?

This is only a trivial change, but a debdiff against the previous version 
shows many differences, which aren't documented. So I don't want to upload
this one without asking...
