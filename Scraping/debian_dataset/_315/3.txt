So we're only checking newer checksums for Packages files (against what's in
Release files, bad bad bad us indeed. IIRC MD5sum field was kept (as in: added
back) because debian-cd needs it at the moment, which partly explains why this
wasn't fixed earlier.
I'm not sure whether this exists already (be it for the whole distribution or
for d-i specifically), but referencing places where stuff like parsing happens
(Release, Packages, etc.), and where checkums are used, would help figure out
what to change when the list of supported fields/checksums are updated. Might
be another way to leverage this whole debacle thing.
