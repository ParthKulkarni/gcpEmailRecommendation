As the initator of this thread I'd like to chime in. My main point of
this thread was about what could be done to make the NEW process a bit
more transparent. 
One conclusion was that for new packages that close ITPs one could add
some code to dak that would append the reasons for rejections to the
ITP. Looking at the code I realized that for someone not familiar with
the code base it is not simple to add this, and the DD who pointed me
at this and is amongst the authors of dak couldn't give me helpful
pointers how this could be implemented, so for now this is stalled, but
it is still on my mind. 
The second part, asking others to give additional reviews to the
package before the first upload, and document these in a bug report and
the changelog one can simply do. 
In any case my issue was not so much with a first upload taking a long
time, but that a re-upload of an already reviewed package waited in thepipeline for a long time, even though
