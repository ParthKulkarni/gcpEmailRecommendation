$ echo 'DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC=log' >> ~/.devscripts
Now dch won't use UNRELEASED and will simply look for a log of an upload
in the parent directory to determine whether the version is released or
not.  The suite will be set to whatever is deemed appropriate based on
the previous changelog entry or the -D switch, instead of using
UNRELEASED.
