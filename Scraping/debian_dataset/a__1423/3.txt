I like this.

Slight quibble: in Ubuntu's terminology, "pocket" actually refers to the
part after the "-", i.e. the axis within the space of suites that
roughly indicates the expected stability level of packages in a given
suite rather than the release (or "series") that they're for.
"zesty-proposed" (for example) is still correctly referred to as a
suite, which can be decomposed into series and pocket.
(IMO the "pocket" terminology is terrible and it's no wonder people are
confused by it, but it's unfortunately entrenched.  It *is* useful to
have a distinct term for that segment of the suite for tools such as
Launchpad that need to apply policy to the same pocket in multiple
series, such as "can't change -updates when the series hasn't been
released yet" or "-backports is published with NotAutomatic".  If we
were going to go to the effort of renaming it nowadays then I suspect
we'd probably pick something like "channel".)
