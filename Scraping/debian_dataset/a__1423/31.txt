I can agree with that.

Please, not the version number. Globally overloading the version to
convey this kind of information would be unfortunate IMO. This, not
only affects us but derivatives too, and depending on whether the
package is native or not, and depending ono where the marking is
placed (upstream or revision part) it also affects the versioning
of upstream projects.
I was very happy when proposing the binary-only=yes keyword and it
being accepted, so that I will be able to eventually remove the
hardcoded parsing of +bN from dpkg-dev. Unfortunately we still have
hardcoded parsing for ~bpo and ~vola to use magic behavior based on
that. I should propose a new backport=yes or similar to deprecate
that too.

The suite should be "invalid" to avoid accidental or unwanted uploads
by third parties in case one needs to sign an intermediate build.
I think using a magic value in the suite name is better. We then could
either use:
  source (1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium, suite=unstable
or
  source (1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium, unreleased-for=unstable
or
  source (1.0) unstable-UNRELEASED; urgency=medium
The advantage of the ones using the metadata key/values is that those
can very easily end up in the generated binaries as fields. So in that
case something like the "Unreleased-For: unstable" would be a pretty
obvious marker?

For these two points, see above. Also this implies having to hunt down
any archive software and fix it, even local scripts etc. It seems too
unsafe to me. :/

Right, that's why for exampel we initially chose "unreleased" as suite
name for the Debian ports archive when they were hosted at gnuab.org!

We are currently somewhat lacking both, where the changes were built
in, and what they were targetting.
I've had a draft [O] for this for years (as a result of an initial
proposal for more generalized bug closure support [C]), which was the
base for the dpkg-vendor, but it seems I never ended up discussing it
more widely within the project for full support. :/ At least from the
initial discussion years ago of [C] in [T], there didn't seem to be
much consensus or wide interest.
  [C] <http://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/debian/docs/closes.proposal>
  [O] <http://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/debian/docs/origin.proposal>
  [T] <https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/11/msg00100.html
We are now already recording the Origin where the build was done in the
.buildinfo file in the Build-Origin field. IMO the binaries should all
gain an Origin field too, automatically injected at build time.
And the target distribution is now somewhat encoded in the changelog
suite, but that has the problem that many derivatives seem to just use
"unstable" instead of naming their own suite, so it's not a very good
discriminator. Annotating the origin in the changelog would be the way
to go IMO, as noted in the [O].

Yeah, also because the changes in general target a specific origin/suite,
but please check [O]. (Although I perhaps should start a new thread
with just the proposal itself.)
Thanks,
