I have a 'current' version, which is the one that will be uploaded
when it's deemed good enough to upload. I don't find that confusing.

Well. If I changed the version I'd still have to do a rebuild to get a
matching .changes and .dsc. (perhaps there is a shortcut to this?). So
it's just the same problem as having UNRELEASED in the changelog,
except that it's much easier to notice, becuase it's right there in
the version in the filename.

Indeed. I like to test exactly the thing I'm going to upload, not
something with a different suite or version number.

I would. And I'm very grateful to whoever it was in this thread that
pointed out that one currently exists.

You are still talking about commits, which implies a VCS. I have a
plain directory containing 'the package' (quilt format so my changes
are reasonably clear). When it's finished I upload it. Debian's
archive stores the definitive 'tagged' version for me.

All N/A so far as I can see. The version in front of me is the version
I'm working on. It has a version number. Changes are added to the
changelog until all the changes are done (as a changelog is intended
to be used). Then it is uploaded. I am a very simple individual :-)

I avoid making mistakes by not using a vcs I don't really
understand. :-) Each version of the package lives in a directory. I
only work on 'latest'. uscan and uupdate manage the creation of new
directories containing new versions, from new upstream releases. dch
manages changelog editing without screwing up the format. quilt
manages the creation of discrete changes. I take some care not to
confuse quilt (which is very easily done, but I understand it so can
fix things when I mess it up).
None of this is helped by the 'UNRELEASED' mechanism.
