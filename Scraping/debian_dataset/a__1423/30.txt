Usable VCSes have pluggable merge drivers, and there are such drivers
for both GNU-style ChangeLog, and debian/changelog[1].  IME, they "just
work".  So, yeah, one *can* have the chagelog-update-along-with-change
workflow sanely most of the time nowadays.  
I would never use such an workflow unless forced, as I believe the
"proper commit log Tao" is better in the long run, and when your commit
logs are proper (and quite verbose), the natural workflow [2] asks for
changelog-updating commits before release (or maybe at the tip of every
ready-for-integration branch, etc), but...
[1] refer to dpkg-mergechangelogs(1) for the git driver for
debian/changelog, for example.
[2] as in "less busywork" while hacking, and no weird (and possibly
maintenance-hell-creating) disparity from commit log contents to in-tree
changelog contents.
