I agree, it's really nice (I'm probably biased though) and would
love to see Debian be able to take advantage of similar
functionality. I wish my hands weren't already too full to help
maintain something along those lines.
That said, the Zuul maintainers have seen some interest expressed
for adding a Gitlab driver similar to its Gerrit and GitHub drivers,
so could eventually be added as an opt-in solution for Salsa repos
if someone has the bandwidth to run an instance (and sooner if
someone actually volunteers for writing the Gitlab driver!).
