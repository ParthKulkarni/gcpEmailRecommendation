Hi folks,
I've written a tool for isolated deb builds in docker containers.
It's a little bit like pbuilder, but using docker for isolation.
https://github.com/metux/docker-buildpackage
Everything written in shellscript, simple config as sh includes.
Not debianized yet, as it might require some local customizations.
(planned for future releases)
I'm also hacking on another tool which automatically clones repos
and calls dck-buildpackage for building whole pipelines - but that's
still experimental and hackish:
