Why does net-boot need to be special cased?  By default, shouldn't the
net-boot media be excluded as an installation target--except for the
expert case.
Another feature that could be piggybacked on the "mount block device
and identify if it's Debian installation media" is OS identification.
It's been so many years since I dual-booted with another OS that I
don't know if this functionality already exists.  If it does exist,
I'm guessing that is where this new "Identify installation media"
could be added.
Re: the identification step:
I don't think it's crazy :-)  Do you know if such a magic file already
exists (especially if the installer build was recorded)?
Can busybox-provided cat, grep, cksum and cmp provide strong enough
magic file match, or do you think we also need a
/sys/.../something/uuid check as well?
Cheers,
Nicholas
