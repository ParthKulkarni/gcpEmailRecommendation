This is true, but I don't think it's a good reason not to implement a
mostly-reliable heuristic.
If there are multiple disks, there are usually going to be just 2 of
them, one of which contains the installer.  In any installer build
other than netboot, it will look for its own disk in order to load
udebs.  Once it has done that, it can determine that the other disk is
the one to install on.  That's a pretty good heuristic.
Aside from that, we can also make a guess based on the bus type:
- ATA: probably internal
- NVMe: probably internal
- USB: probably external
- MMC/SD: ambiguous (eMMC must be internal, and Linux has a notion of
'non-removable' slots, but I don't think userland has this info)
If we could get more information about MMC/SD slots then we should be
able to implement an heuristic that would work for >99% of cases.
