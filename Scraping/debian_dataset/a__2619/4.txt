Right, in theory the dtbs are independant from the kernel, but real life
is different. That's why the linux image packages ship their matchin
device trees. I don't know your setup, but it would be easiest to use
these. If you don't provide your own dtb and just use
	DTB-Id: sun7i-a20-cubietruck.dtb
everything should simply work.
Best regards
