Makes sense, sorry for not doing so.

Ack.  I see mejo has just requested the transition slot in #884618, that
means we should we block that bug by #88052[56], right?

The format isn't the new default in the sense that `cryptsetup
luksFormat` still creates “legacy” LUKS (version 1) devices, and one
needs to append `--type luks2` to create LUKS2 devices.  Opening a LUKS2
block device does require a locking directory[0] (/run/lock/cryptsetup),
but partman-crypto can stay as is as long as it keeps creating LUKS1
devices.
Not sure what's upstream's intention regarding making `cryptsetup
luksFormat` create LUKS2 devices by default, but at this stage it seems
precipitated to switch to LUKS2 in d-i: I'd rather stick to upstream's
default, especially considering the following snippets of their v2.0.0
Release Notes:
    “Please note that […] the LUKS2 on-disk format itself are new
    features and can contain some bugs.”
    — https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/v2.0.0/docs/v2.0.0-ReleaseNotes#L15
(And FWIW it's possible to later in-place convert a device from LUKS1 to
LUKS2 format using `cryptsetup convert`, although it of course won't
magically upgrade the crypto & PKDF algorithms.)

For libargon2-0 it should be a matter of changing the default PBKDF back
to pbkdf2, but I don't see a way to drop the libjson-c3 dependency
unless we compile cryptsetup without LUKS2 support (LUKS2 headers
contain metadata stored in JSON format [1]), which is not trivial
AFAICT.
