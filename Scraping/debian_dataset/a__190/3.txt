FWIW, feel free to (x-debbugs-)cc debian-boot@ when requesting such
additions; you might get some feedback like a patch or two, or
alternative routes to consider.
I hadn't spotted libcryptsetup12-udeb isn't installable due to these
dependencies, as experimental isn't checked automatically:
  https://d-i.debian.org/dose/
I've added this as a todo item, along with looking into src:argon2 and
src:json-c. I'll try to look into that next week (ping welcome), but
we'll need to get those packages past NEW; it would be appreciated to
only start the cryptsetup transition once dependencies can be satisfied,
to avoid breaking d-i daily builds purposefully.
Also, from one the those two bugs: ‚Äúcryptsetup ‚â•2.0.0 introduces a new
on-disk ‚ÄúLUKS2‚Äù format, which support Argon2i and Argon2id as PBKDF.‚Äù
Is that a new default format? Does it need any special handling from
d-i components, like options or files to create, or is that just a
transparent change for cryptsetup callers?
Alternatively, instead of waiting for udebs to be available for the
dependencies, maybe support for those two libraries could be patched
out temporarily in the cryptsetup udebs?
Cheers,
