Thanks for letting us (debian-boot@) know. AFAICT, on the udeb side we
only have crypsetup-udeb that depends on its library udeb, and no other
udebs are in the loop. Since a version with the bumped soname is
available in experimental, someone from the d-i team could build d-i
against it and see if cryptsetup still works as expected. And even if
that doesn't happen, we have no immediate plans for a release yet, so
there's no disruption risk: feel free to proceed whenever you see fit
(but see below).

You would usually request a transition slot through a bug report against
release.debian.org (pick 'transition'), and coordinate uploads & binNMUs
with the release team.
