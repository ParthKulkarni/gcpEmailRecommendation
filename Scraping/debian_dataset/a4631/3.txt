No objections.
A couple of things (feel free to follow up only to debian-boot and me):
 - debian/files is left over after building a source package; while I
   know mostly nothing about dpkg-genbuildinfo, it feels a bit weird
   compared to all other d-i packages which leave a clean git tree after
   a source build;
 - does it make sense to force bzip2 for the source tarball? It dates
   back to 2011, so was probably an improvement over gz, but now that we
   have xz, just using that would probably make sense?
