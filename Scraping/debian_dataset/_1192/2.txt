So it looks that Balint was also surprised by the extent of the changes to
support PIE in dpkg.  And afaics at the time of the dpkg upload, they were not
discussed or documented, same for the spec file changes.  Instead you seem to
prefer to accuse others for "childish behavior" after over a month staying quiet
... not sure if that is the right thing to start the discussion.
At this point, I would prefer to revert the PIE changes for the release and
discuss these after the release with all parties involved.
