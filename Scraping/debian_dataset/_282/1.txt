Hi,
today I have committed changes to push the Debian Installer Internationalization 
and Localization Guide (aka d-i internals manual) to www.
I created a new directory at dillon: /srv/d-i.debian.org/www/d-i-internals
for this and added a cron job (actually disabled) to build that daily.
Since it's a really small manual, no real load added to dillon.
Is this ok for you?
Any impacts I forgot, or something could be done better/different?
We could also add a directory like "doc" under www and put all d-i documentation 
together...
And: should we rename "manual" into "installation-guide" now, to reflect the
changed official name? (Ah, there could be many places, which link to the old url.
That's also an argument to not move it into a doc subfolder.)
Cheers
Holger
