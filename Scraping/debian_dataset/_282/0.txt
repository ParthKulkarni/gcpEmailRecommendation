Ping?
May I assume, that you are fine with the D-I Internals solution, as it is now?
Another one:
I have worked to get statistics back for the installation-guide, too.
There used to be a page on alioth for this, and now I think it would make sense
to have that under https://d-i.debian.org/manual/.
Under that URL, the old statistics page from alioth is now online (while
some data is still missing; a new full build run is just running).
As a consequence, I have disabled a cron entry
0 23 * * * cd $DI/installation-guide && git pull ; cd build && destination=$WWW/manual ./build.sh >/dev/null ; ~/bin/push-www
which built the installation-guide daily in the past.
Do you still want such cron job?
It builds the whole manual, no matter what has changed.
On the contrary, the manual-daily job only builds those languages, which
received changings.
Greetings
Holger
