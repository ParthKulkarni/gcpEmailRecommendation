One of the things at least to my mind is we (the users) do not know
which is most closest testing release  near to the final release. For
e.g.  take the last/latest announcement done by Cyril Brulebois on
13th June talking about the Stretch RC5 release. In the whole
announcement, there is not even a hint to potential testers that this
might be the closest to the final released (gold) image. I am
presuming/assuming that Cyril was also talking about the live image
and not the just the installer improvements.
What would be nicer/better perhaps if debian-live does announcements
on d-d-a  and more importantly hint as when it's going to be nearer to
release (final image).
We are going to have a release party this week-end in Pune (haven't
posted the details yet at https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyStretch
, hoping the organizers will do the needful otherwise will do it in a
day or two.
I/we could also have testing parties before the release as well with a
two-week window to the final image . This also gives times to students
to see how things work in the real world as well.
I can't volunteer for any activities atm (due to health issues) except
for taking part in organising testing party in Pune before release and
getting more people to file bugs in case they hit problems.
I am hopeful we can find a better way/solution to the above.
