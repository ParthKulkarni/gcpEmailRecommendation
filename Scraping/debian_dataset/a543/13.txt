Thanks!

We have some armhf images for installation, but not for live yet. The
hard bit there is reliably *booting* an image on many of the
platforms. As more and more of them start supporting UEFI (if nothing
else, via the minimal U-Boot UEFI boot hacks) that will help. arm64
live images are on my todo list already for the buster cycle.
