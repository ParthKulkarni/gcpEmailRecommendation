Yes, this is a good reason to do a run-time check.

It is optional but not "often" omitted.  I'm only aware of Cavium
leaving it out.

I think you're referring to the need for DMB on v6+, right?  The ARMv6
ARM claims that memory ordering wasn't specified at all in earlier
architecture versions, so older code using SWP was not portable anyway.
So far as I can see, OpenSSL still uses SWP when built for ARMv4/v5,
and does not use DMB.  We should really fix that.
dietlibc also uses SWP without DMB - but then its ARMv6/v7
implementation and several other architectures (mips, ppc) are also
lacking memory barriers, so I assume no-one really uses it in
multithreaded programs.
uclibc has some trivial wrappers around SWP that don't seem to be used
any more.
And... that's it, so far as I can see.
Ben.
