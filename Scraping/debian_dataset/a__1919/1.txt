As someone responsible for a similar high-volume git server farm for
another free software community, we have exactly the same behavior
anonscm did before the rewrites got implemented. Closest I can find
published by DSA is
<URL: https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/mirror/dsa-puppet.git/tree/modules/roles/files/dgit/git.dgit.debian.org >
so I'm assuming something like that was done for the anonscm service
as well. Am I looking in the wrong place for the configuration
management covering the anonscm.d.o service, or is that not actually
published anywhere?
