I've seen this repeated multiple times in this thread, where does your
assessment that the usrmerge package can leave the system in a non
working state comes from?
In my experience, usrmerge stops the merge if it encounters some
unforeseen difficulty and hints to how to resolve the problem. Once the
problem has been resolved, usrmerge can be run again and it will pick up
from where it left.
Is your experience different? Can you be more precise on the kind of
errors or system breakage you encountered?
Thank you.
Best,
Daniele
