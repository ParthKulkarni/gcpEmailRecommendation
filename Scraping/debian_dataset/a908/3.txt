I did a QA upload for tamil-gtk2im in June, as it was blocking some changes in gtk+2.0.
However, the package has been orphaned for at least two years. And, as I wrote in the 
original bug report, it only supports gtk2.
After doing some reading, ibus-m17n looks to be the best input method for Tamil.
Of course, I don't know the language at all, so I can't be certain.
How will switching to ibus-m17n affect the user experience or installation?
