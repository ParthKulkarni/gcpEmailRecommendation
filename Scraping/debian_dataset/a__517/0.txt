AIUI the tracker.debian.org team are working to make it possible to list
the package tracker as the package maintainer, I believe using the old
foo@packages.debian.org address.
Then all co-maintainers of the package will
- list themselves in Uploaders
- subscribe to the package on tracker.d.o
In this way, we transition away from a semantic distinction between
Maintainer and Uploaders without having to change any tools.  It's much
less work than what you are proposing.
People who want to maintain the distinction can use the fields
separately but those who want maintainers to be on equal footing don't
have to.
