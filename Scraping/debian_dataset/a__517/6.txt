If it really is intended that the listed Maintainer be on an equal
footing with any and all listed Uploaders, and there's no semantic
difference between these fields - just the arbitrary limitation that one
of them can't have more than one entry - wouldn't it make sense to
deprecate the Maintainer: field, and move towards using Uploaders: only?
I'm not sure that would be a good idea, but it would at least avoid the
apparent misunderstanding of the meaning of the roles which seems to
have underlain some of the dispute in this case, and eliminating
meaningless redundancy in a spec is generally a good thing.
