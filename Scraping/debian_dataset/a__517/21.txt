I think we all want this eventually.  Relying on tracker to deliver most
package related e-mails is a step in that direction because tracker has
built in support for a concept of teams.  We can start to figure out a
new way to track team membership and maintainance in Debian, and perhaps
the uploaders field will just become genuinely obsolete.
