I've not yet used WireGuard, but from what I can see one needs a unique
key per client to be known to the server (perhaps there's a way of
telling it not to care).  Also, the examples around the place also seem
to suggest that one needs a UDP port per connection.
Also, the wireguard.com front page does currently say:
  WireGuard is not yet complete. _You should not rely on this code._
Anyway, I don't see that one actually needs WireGuard to implement it.
A similar result could be achieved by configuring the new system to ssh
to a server somewhere, and either have that connection used for the
remote control, or have ssh also do port-forwarding back to the new
installation.
Of course we then have to work out under what circumstances the user
should trust that person to be connected to their network, the
implications of which one cannot really expect a newbie to fully grasp.
Cheers, Phil.
