This is in response to a discussion that happened on this list. The
thread started in august last year[1], but really picked up speed last
month[2] and this one[3].
The idea is that, if no critical issues are found, buster would release
with AppArmor enabled by default. If critical issues are found, however,
I expect the decision will be reversed (or at the least, postponed).

If AppArmor is to become the default, then having it be recommended by
the kernel is a proper way of implementing that; it would be pulled in
by default, but if you don't want it it's still possible to remove it.
(I won't comment on the "fairly bogus one" bit, I'm not that well versed
in the specifics of AppArmor vs the other options there)

Perhaps the changelog could be clarified then, there are other reasons
:-)

Yes, indeed. I haven't seen such a failure; but if you have, then please
do file a bug -- that's not supposed to happen.
