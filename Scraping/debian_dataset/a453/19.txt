Hi all,
is there any good reason for the recommends of apparmor in the latest
linux packages?  apparomor is just one of many security modules, and
a fairly bogus one to start with.  The kernel should not recommend it
as it doesn't add at all to the expected kernel functionality.
The changelog suggests it was done that systemd units might use it,
but in that case those systemd units should depend on apparmor.
And to start with there probably should be a policty that no unit
file shall fail the boot for a missing security module (any of them).
