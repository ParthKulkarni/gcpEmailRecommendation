A way to set the version during the build, as you suggest, would be
sufficient to cover this.  It is hard to see how we could relieve the
user of the need to understand how to choose a version number for a .deb
for testing.  An option to set the version in the build command line
would remove the need for Debian source package knowledge.

We basically already have all the pieces:
- git-request-pull(1)
- reportbug(1)
- git hosting on alioth / our shiny pagure git hosting (coming soon)
dgit could ship a script that ties these together.  (The reason I suggest
using our own git hosting is so that the branch doesn't disappear -- one
advantage of patches in the BTS is that they can't 404.)
