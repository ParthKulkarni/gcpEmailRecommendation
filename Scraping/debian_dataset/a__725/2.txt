I'm aware of these issues, but it seems to make sense to concentrate
on release architectures, which have a huge user base, and which need
improved hardware support.
There are enough moving parts as it is to avoid adding ports-specific
issues to the mix (as already mentioned in my reply to one of those
bug reports). Please let us figure out how to deal with release archs
and backports first.
Cheers,
