Phew. I suppose that'd mean touching the pkgdetails API (which is
implemented in both perl in debootstrap and in C in debian-installer's
base-installer) and add a new command that allows to obtain the Provides
for a given package. And then use that to include an additional package
in the package list if HTTPS is used - the mirror is set up through
setup_etc in first_stage_install and we can't really access the metadata
in a different way there.
This should probably wait for Thomas Lange's speed-up patches to be
merged as well.
Kind regards
