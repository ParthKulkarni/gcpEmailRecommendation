Understandable and desirable, but perhaps it's just me: Quite often I
find myself in the situation where I have to poke things on a much
lower level than I'm comfortable with. Because the tools and/or libraries
are just painfully slow or don't even exist at all. There still might be
something in devscripts - where so many things are hidden I wasn't even
surprised to find the Amber Chamber - but at some point it seems easier
to hack something together instead of looking around whether there's
something available for the job.

How would that help me in the situation as above?

    The correct recommendation was to use
    Dpkg::Compression::compression_get_file_extension_regex
)
