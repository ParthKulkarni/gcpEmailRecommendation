I'm afraid this pretty much is not going to happen, besides being

That thread started at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/06/threads.html#00173>
and continued at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/07/threads.html#00377>
and further at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/08/threads.html#00021>.
Please also read the bug reports referenced.
