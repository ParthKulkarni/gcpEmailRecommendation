Ah.  I looked on PATH.  I expect "Front door" programs to be on PATH
nowadays.

So this is not really a replacement for the impugned compression
regexps because
 * it's not available in stable (some of us care about backportability
    and supporting stable users)
 * it involves invoking a command and parsing the output to get
    trivial information which should be available as a simple
    variable in a scripting language
 * it provides only a more-cooked interface than is probably wanted
A better answer would be the perl function
   Dpkg::Compression::compression_guess_from_filename
which is fairly easy to use and has been available for a long time.
Useable something like this:
  https://browse.dgit.debian.org/dgit.git/tree/dgit#n2163
Or if you just want to strip the compression extension then
  \.([^\.]+)
and call compression_guess_from_filename on $1 and see if it's undef.
See for example
  https://manpages.debian.org/wheezy/libdpkg-perl/Dpkg::Compression.3.en.html
Ideally other languages should have something similar.
Ian.
