Some time ago I migrated my home dhcp server from isc to freeradius.
Almost everything worked like a charm.
The only thing were problems with arp table [1].
Then I ended with configuration:
radius binary have set cap bits[2]
radius is run from systemd as freerad user
(it is important that "User=freerad" should be in unit file, not only
radius config)
the only thing is '/var/run/freeradius/' directory creation.
Is it bad idea to make freeradius run as freerad user with capabilities
enabled?

Everyone is a genius.  It's just that some people are too stupid to realize it.
