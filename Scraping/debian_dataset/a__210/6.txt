Consider instead having systemd set the capabilties in the unit file using
AmbientCapabilities.  It ends up being roughly equivalent for the service,
but it means that processes that run the binary outside of the context of
systemd won't get the capabilities, which slightly decreases the chances
of some local privilege escalation attacks.

I think this sort of change is an excellent idea, and would love to see
more of this type of hardening in Debian as default behavior.
