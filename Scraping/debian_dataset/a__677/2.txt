at a time where I was also wondering whether it would make sense to have some
common terminology for all these things I wrote up this wiki page:
https://wiki.debian.org/DependencyHell
In the section "Specifying the object of a dependency relation" you can see
three answers for what you are asking that I have seen used in the wild.
Contributions to that page welcome. :)
