I don't know a simple term in English that carries that meaning.
To me, “depender” feel like a neologism and does not make me confident
the reader would know what is meant. I vote −1 to that term.
The adjective “dependent” is IMO fine, so perhaps the noun phrase
“dependent package” is a good candidate. It's not the single word you're
looking for, but maybe it is unambiguous for the purpose?
