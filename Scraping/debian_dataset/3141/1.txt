I'm no mentor. That said, my immediate reaction is that you cannot
really do this at package installation. systemd --user services are
managed by individual users, and the package can only prepare so that
users can enable their services.
For example:  what happens if a new user is added after the package is
installed?
A good package should support their users doing this, at a minimum in
documentation, still better with  some tooling to set it up properly.
Not all users are comfortable using systemctl --user, and some help is
certainly appreciated.
Cheers!
