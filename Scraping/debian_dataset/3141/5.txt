Hi Simon,
the package is dbus-broker, a replacement for dbus-deamon. You may have
heard of it: there has been a short exchange about its packaging for
Debian with its developers with the Debian dbus maintainers in Cc.
dbus-broker ships an user instance unit file with this Install section:
[Install]
Alias=dbus.service
with
# systemctl --global enable foo.service
a /etc/systemd/user/dbus.service symlink is created that overrides the
unit installed by dbus-daemon obtaining that dbus-broker "takes over"
the bus activation units installed by dbus-daemon. A similar thing is
done for the system bus, but that is taken care of by dh_systemd_enable
just fine.
I can create the link manually.
Cheers,
Dan
