This works better in 2.4.10 with the backport and in 2.4.25: There,
printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n" | nc localhost 80
gives a 400 Bad request, as expected.

Have you tried if that diff helps with
  printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n" | nc localhost 80
returning nothing? I don't see how the change would help, but I haven't tried 
it or looked at the code in total.

Note that telnet does LF -> CRLF conversion, so telnet still works for 
debugging. But nc does not.

I am not sure either. For 2.4.10/jessie  the changes are a bit less intrusive 
and I intend to use the backported version:
 9 files changed, 1064 insertions(+), 303 deletions(-)
But for 2.2/wheezy it's a difficult decision.

Probably a good idea is to put the packages somewhere and ask for testers on 
security@lists.debian.org . Maybe explicitly encourage testers who use 
mod_proxy. If you get some feedback and no unexpected issues are found, I 
would tend towards using the backported patches.
BTW, I have included this patch to allow underscores in hostnames:
