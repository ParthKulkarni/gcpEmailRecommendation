This doesn't look too bad, but not perfect. The diff of the results from 
2.2.22-13+deb7u7 to your packages, with tweaks to make the test suite run the 
tests that are new for 2.2.32 is this:

The mmn.t fail is expected and ok. You haven't backported all new features 
from 2.2.32, so you should not bump the magic number to the number from 
2.2.32.
The messages from t/apache/server_name_port.t are just unexpected PASSes, 
probably the test suite lacks proper TODO specification for 2.2.32 here.
Apart from that, your package does not cause any regressions. However, of the 
new tests for the HTTPProtocolOptions feature, three tests fail. Two of these 
have to do with NUL-Bytes in the request. 
I have put the full logs and some scripts and diffs to run the test suite at 
[1]. 
For jessie, I am not that far, yet. So I don't have any hints about the 
http_strict.t test fails.
In 2.4.25, the changes have been reported to break underscores in hostnames 
[2]. While these are not RFC-conforming, this is probably not something one 
should break in a security update. Therefore I would relax the hostname 
checking to also accept underscores. I think the relevant code is in vhost.c 
in fix_hostname_non_v6() .
Cheers,
Stefan
