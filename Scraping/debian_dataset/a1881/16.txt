here are those tests:
2: [ "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n"                          => 400],
8: [ "GET / HTTP/1.0\0\r\n\r\n"                    => 400],
26: [ "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nFoo: b\0ar\r\n\r\n"        => 400],
#2 is weird - it just returns nothing now:
$ printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n" | nc localhost 80
$
which is a major WTF for someone used to "telnet into port 80", as UNIX
line endings now fail - which is unexpected of course, but actually
respecting RFC, iirc.
nothing in the logs, and nothing i could find in GDB. the apache2
process just seems to close the socket and leave it at that.
#8 is a plain failure - it actually works and returns 200 instead of
400. same with #26.
so definitely more work to be done there... sigh. i'll review the final
diff to figure out what's going on here.
