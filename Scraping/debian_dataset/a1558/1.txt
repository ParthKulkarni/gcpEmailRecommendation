The git repo is for for the build system for d-i, whereas the svn is the
repo for the top level directory which then lets you check out
everything else, including that git repo and the repos for the udeb
packages, as described here:
  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/CheckOut
having just checked out the svn here, it worked, so I suspect that the
problem that happened with the svn checkout might have been simply that
the Alioth server was having a funny five minutes.
It's probably worth retrying the svn checkout.
If I then run:

You can see that the SVN really is still in use (at least it was on Sunday).
Cheers, Phil.
