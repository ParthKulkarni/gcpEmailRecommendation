Not silly, it's our fault.
We have this wiki page: https://wiki.debian.org/WhoUsesDebian
and some more info here:
https://salsa.debian.org/webmaster-team/webwml/tree/master/english/users
But we failed to include that info in the bug report (fixing it now by CC'ing
the bug address).
> And there has been no activity on this bug since 2014.
Depending on the skills, time and motivation of the contributor(s) willing to
help updating /users, the process has been more or less automated (e.g. others
use a script to produce the mails, I write them manually with a Thunderbird
template, etc.).
We've been updating the /users section in several batches since some years. I
sent my last mails about this in 2016, and couldn't find the time to put on this
task since then. I guess the other contributors also prioritised other tasks
when contributing to Debian.
If you want to help with the Who's using Debian section update, feel free to
send a mail to the bug (766923@bugs.debian.org), and we can try to resume the
work together.
About general info/guidance for newcomers, we have www.debian.org/intro/help as
has been pointed out already, and also https://wiki.debian.org/Welcome/
In the Debian Project News (https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/ ) we usually
have a section "Help needed" linking to the packages that need help, the
newcomer bug list, and specific help for teams that told us to publish an
announce about help needed.
Thanks!
