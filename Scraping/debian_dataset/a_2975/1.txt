Want to report on findings since I last emailed:
(1) IRC debian-mentors is NOT for mentees to ask question, and is invite-only
(2) WHEREAS the mailing list debian-mentors (of the same name, ;p) is open and explicitly described as a place for mentees to seek help.  I have just subscribed.
(3) https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsFaq has information for BOTH mentors and mentees (with a section "for sponsors", as well as FAQ entries on "where to FIND a sponsor").
Unless I have missed some other documents (debian has plenty), I do think the community can use one single document that makes new comers onboarding a bit easier.
I offer my time to help, if someone can use me, point me in the right directions, and give me a slap on my hand when I need it.
Cheerio,
Ken

I have packaged RPMs for university projects and used cvs, svn, git, etc in various projects, so I am not exactly totally clueless. But I did have some learning curve for debian. I have been reading debian-devel for a bit, watching WNPP, watching how-can-I-help on my system, and read the QA page and BTS for things I am interested in. Oh of course, I worked a bit following the new maintainer's guide, etc..

So I am perfectly okay these low hanging fruits are still left hanging. And I actually expect this condition to persist.
