It does, however, mean that it's a good idea for us to continue to support
sysvinit.
We have a workable compromise at the moment, and it doesn't seem to be
causing huge amounts of pain.  As long as that continues, I plan on

go to a ton of work to add new and exciting features to them.  (But
patches welcome.)
