Hi folks,
Now that casulana is set up and knows how to build installation images,
Steve gave me a green light for a new alpha release. We've been having
a few issues on dillon (see previous mails on debian-boot@), but maybe
I'm not going to block the release on fixing those.
I'll try and find some time this week to assess whether releasing looks
feasible.
KiBi.
