Is that a dpkg-buildpackage option? It's documented to fail on certain
packages, you need to use -J instead, and maintainers need to certify that
a package can be built in parallel by bumping the debhelper compat level
or passing appropriate flags to debhelper tools.

Yes. Please test packages and submit patches.

No, building the package with -j`nproc` is not enough, you also need to be
sure the result works correctly (and repro is not very useful for this
until 100% coverage).
