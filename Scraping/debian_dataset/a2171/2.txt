Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.108
Running debootstrap fails because it tries to fetch the package list
shown in /var/lib/apt/lists named binary-i386_Packages.  But there is no
such file on the server.  Instead there are files: binary-i386_Packages.gz
and binary-i386_Packages.xz but it doesn't look for them.  I've run strace
on it.  Here's the command I gave and results:
debootstrap --variant=minbase --verbose stretch /minboot http://debian.usu.edu/debian
I: Retrieving InRelease 
I: Checking Release signature
I: Valid Release signature (key id 067E3C456BAE240ACEE88F6FEF0F382A1A7B6500)
I: Retrieving Packages 
E: Couldn't download http://debian.usu.edu/debian/dists/stretch/main/binary-i386/Packages
debootstrap needs to find one of the compressed files. download it, and
unconpress it.  But it doesn't.
