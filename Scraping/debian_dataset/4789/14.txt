Yes, I already found that out in the meantime.
Thanks for clarifying.
Why I made that assumption: when trying to get sbuild
running for cross-compiling, I got error messages, that made
think I would have to create "some special sort of chroot".
And why did I get such errors: I used the options in a incorrect
form: I wanted to build a package for s390x, and therefore used
--build=s390x or  --arch=s390x. Using --host=s390x (which 
would have been correct) did not seemed correct for me and
the manpage does not explain it in detail.
I thought like one would think when it comes to virtual machines:
there the host is the hardware you are running the VM on.
And the virtual OS is the guest.
Porting this logic to sbuild would mean,  --host=amd64 must
be correct (my laptop, the "host",  is amd64)  but it wasn't.
Maybe that could be made clearer in the sbuild manpage?
 
The manpage of sbuild.conf says it clear:
It uses terms like "architecture we are building on" and
"architecture we are building for".
I just added an example for cross-compiling to the wiki page
of sbuild BTW. 
Thanks
Holger
