So, I've tried to reproduce the issue and failed. I'm in a qemu VM on a
network that provides IPv6 SLAAC with RDNSS and IPv4 DHCP. I have booted
using the RC2-netinst-amd64 image and installed the XFCE desktop task.
As expected I ended up with rdnssd installed (no network-manager), but
/etc/network/interfaces is properly populated and I got network
connectivity.
I think I have found the source of your problem. According to your logs
you are installing on a WiFi interface (wlp2s0). The first attempt to
write your /etc/network/interfaces shows correct stanzas for the interface

but the second attempt in finish-install.d only writes the loopback

I think the code to blame is here

in finish-install /e/n/i will never be properly populated for a wireless
installation without network-manager, although I think ifupdown would be
capable to do this (not tested, but have a look at
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/netcfg.git/tree/write_interface.c).
I guess the justification is that people using wireless usually would
want a GUI to roam between networks, and a interface stanza would
prevent even a (later installed) network-manager from touching the
interface.
rdnssd just triggers this more often because it will prevent
network-manager installations on the desktop tasks normally using the
wireless connectivity.
But, all in all, I think network-manager should take precedence over
rdnssd. So we can either
a) go for Cyril's suggestion and just install rdnssd in finish-install
if network-manager is not getting installed there (but honestly I have
no idea of the netcfg code base)
b) drop the Conflicts and make the rdnssd merge-hook a no-op if
network-manager is installed/running.
