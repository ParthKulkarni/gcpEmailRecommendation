Maybe it just depends on one's perspective, but with my Debian user hat
on, I interact with the output of dak and its integrations with apt and
debootstrap and the like *way* more often than I interact with the
installer.  The output of libisofs is something I use every year or two;
the output of dak is something I consume multiple times per day.
Not arguing that you're wrong about the close link between libisofs and
our product, but I do think that any argument you can make about it
applies about equally well to dak.  They're both "just" ways of shipping a
set of Debian packages in a particular consumable configuration used by
key components of our distribution.
