This is very understandable. The thing is however, exact same
arguments can be applied to justify e.g. usage of proprietary software
to produce Debian images. In both cases tools used to reproduce an
image are not available to the community and it doesn't make much
difference whether these tools are completely unavailable or just
incorporate some non-public patches and tweaks. This is where people
get worried.
