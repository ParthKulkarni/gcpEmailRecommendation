I believe the embedded MBR is part of the libisofs project.

No doubt the particular version of libisofs was used for good reasons.
My concern is the ability to replicate and derive the least possible 
from Debian resources like the install images.
Concretely The Debian derivative PureOS is having trouble booting their 
homemade live image on some hardware, but boots fine on both Debian 
netinst image and Debian live image.  Looking at the properly working 
images I noticed that the live image for stable was produced using 
newer-than-stable libisofs, and that the stable netinst image was 
produced using a never-in-Debian release of libisofs.
A related issue is bug#807168.

Thanks for clarifying the severity of such theoretic bug specifically.
It was just an example, however, and my real question was generally what 
governs code we distribute outside packages - i.e. our install images, 
if Debian Policy covers only packages.
