I've corrected several of your incorrect assertions already. I'm bored
of this.
Making images often requires tweaks to the build script at/near
release time. The archive continues to be a moving target until very
close to that time. More than once we've fixed things or added
workarounds in the image generation scripts *on release day*. I'm not
going to remove the ability to do that and make working images to
pander to your ideals here.
