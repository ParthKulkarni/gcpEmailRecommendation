Until someone volunteers to help, I think this is just a bunch of nit picking that the people who are doing the work should actively ignore.  Personally, I think sniping about how people who are doing the work are doing it "wrong" by people who aren't is one of the most demotivating things that happens in Debian.
Is there anyone who cares about this that is willing to help?
