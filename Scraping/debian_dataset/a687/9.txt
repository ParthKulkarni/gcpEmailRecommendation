We can have another tracker, sure. But then we want to use the data of the
main tracker and we want to push our own data. We could fork the git
repository and merge regularly but it's going to generate lots of
conflicts and will be somewhat annoying to handle.
Are you suggesting that it should be possible to store our own data
in another git repository and that the tracker should be easily able to
merge the data coming from two distincts repositories ?

Yes, but I believe that those common packages are plain Debian packages.
It's also not clear how many packages are going to be covered but the
initial list looks like very short.
