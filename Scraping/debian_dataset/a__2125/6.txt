I have also looked at these patches, and they look good to me, and also
work great here. Using a local APT proxy, these patches make debootstrap
complete in ~ 2/3 of the time that debootstrap from unstable takes.
The one thing I found is that trying to use debootstrap with these
patches with mkosi makes mkosi crash like this:
‚Ä£ Installing Debian complete.
‚Ä£ Assigning hostname...
‚Ä£ Assigning hostname complete.
‚Ä£ Unmounting Package Cache...
‚Ä£ Unmounting Package Cache complete.
‚Ä£ Resetting machine ID...

I can't reproduce this with current debootstrap from unstable, but 1)
none of these patches seem to do anything related, and 2) the error
happens after debootstrap is already done, so I suspect this might be an
issue with mkosi that is surfaced by debootstrap running faster, and not
an issue with debootstrap itself.
