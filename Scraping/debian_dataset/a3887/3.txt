I'm sorry for not contacting you in advance, I thought it would be ok to forward
the patches. I'll seek approval in the future and discuss the patches to be
forwarded in advance.
I'm closing the bug and in case a new bug will be needed for forwarding some
of the patches I'll open a new one.
Thanks,
Balint
