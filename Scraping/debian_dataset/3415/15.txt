For packages maintained by very small (or unitary) teams with limited
collaboration, ad-hoc sharing via personal git repos works OK.  And of
course you can share your git branch more formally with everyone,
in step with the archive, and with reasonable security, by using `dgit
push'.

Yay :-).  Please use dgit push, so that you share your
actually-uploaded git branch as well as just the package.
Thanks,
Ian.
