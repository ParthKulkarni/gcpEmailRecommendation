I agree with that, for the record. Like any upload I sponsor or work on,
I review the diff before signing anyways, regardless of the source.

I really should give dgit a try again, but I guess it's a great use case
for people allergic to salsa (pun intended) and that just need a git
repo, right? :)

But "collab-maint" (also known as "debian" now on Salsa) also works
fine. I don't need a new package to maintain so I'd be happy to let you
proceed with the future of this one. :)

Awesome! I'll proceed with the upload of "internetarchive" (binary and
source, after consulting with #debian-python people) shortly as well.
