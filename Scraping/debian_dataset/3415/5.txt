You need to coordinate the transition for the /usr/bin/ia filename.  I
think that means your new internet-archive package should probably
  Conflict: python-duckduckgo2 (<< version-without-ia~)
That can probably be uploaded before the new python-duckduckgo2 but
the relevant version number should be agreed.  And if you do upload
internet-archive before python-duckduckgo2 is changed there there
should probably be a bug against python-duckduckgo2.  I guess that bug
doesn't need to be rc ?
