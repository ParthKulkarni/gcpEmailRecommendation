It breaks my workflow ;) I use pristine-tar(1) to store orig tarballs
with their upstream signature in git.
dpkg-buildpackage(1) do not extract orig.tar.gz from `pristine-tar'
automatically, so I add `get-orig-source' rule that invokes
`pristine-tar(1)' with proper arguments.
I have debian/watch too, but it `uscan(1)` would require network access.
How can I do better with new Policy?
