I have read this, but it does not convince me. My rule to get the
upstream packagage was always: use uscan, if d/watch exists, otherwise
use get-orig-source. Sounds pretty simple and straigt-forward. If it
fails, I had a starting point where to debug (usually just a missing
dep). I see no reaso why this should be given up.
