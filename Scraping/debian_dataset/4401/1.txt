This overstates the case a bit.  It's true that we don't have a large
number of people working on Launchpad in the way that we did pre-2012,
but there's still active development going on and we can and do slot in
small amounts of unplanned work easily enough.  (However, as I said in
my previous reply to this thread, I don't believe any Launchpad work is
needed in this case.)
