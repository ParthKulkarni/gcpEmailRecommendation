Yes, I felt my email was getting a bit long. Ubuntu's gnome-calculator
now has some patches that depend on proposed gnome-shell search
provider improvements. There's a bit of a backlog for Ubuntu's
gnome-shell patches getting reviewed in GNOME. So there is a temporary
diff but there was no diff except for the epoch for the 18.04 LTS
release.

I appreciate your thinking of possible solutions, but my understanding
is that Canonical isn't investing in any more Launchpad work than is
necessary. And it's rare for anyone else to work on Launchpad.
Thanks,
