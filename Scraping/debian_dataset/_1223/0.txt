At least ublock origin is available as Debian package for Chromium (as well as 
Firefox) meanwhile. But in experimental only. And it appears to be the only 
extension for Chromium packaged in Debian currently.
With Firefox I mostly try to stick with extensions packaged in Debian, but I 
do add some from addons.mozilla.org like Privacy Settings, Video 
Downloadhelper and CanvasBlocker.
Thanks,
