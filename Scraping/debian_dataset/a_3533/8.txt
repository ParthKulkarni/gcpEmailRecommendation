FWIW, I did something similar in tcpdf where I had to replace a non-free
ICC color profile with a free implementation. In fact I automated the
replacement in debian/gen-orig-source.sh.
The situation is a bit different because the ICC color profile is not
source code but the underlying logic is the same.

So yes, I believe it's OK to proceed that way.
