Hi guys,
I was reviewing Tobias' updates on the use of dbg packages vs dbgsym
in dev ref and was wondering if there was any other know use cases
where we cannot use dbgsym over dbg packages for building debugging
symbols.
As far as I remember the Python extensions where the ones that were
not working well with dbgsym (I don't remember why), but I'm wondering
if there are any other known cases where the dbgsym packages cannot be
used.

Thanks for your help,
