I would prefer a merge request over a bug with an attached patch: the
gitlab workflow is quite effective, especially when compared to a
(randomly formatted) patch file. And I also like that the patch author
is automatically attributed when the patch is accepted.
Is it possible to setup a gitlab hook that automatically generates a
"patch" tagged bug report when a merge request is created?
Cheers
