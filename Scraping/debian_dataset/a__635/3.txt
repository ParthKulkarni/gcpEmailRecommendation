Hello, I have the same issue.
Installing debian 9 stretch, both cd (debian-9.5.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso) 
and the dvd versions.
I used the additional drivers (from 
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/stretch/20180714/), 
and I put these .deb packages on another usb key : the effect is that I 
don't have the step where they search for firmware for 
rtlwifi/rtl8723befw.bin and rtl_nic/rtl8168g-2.fw
I managed to install Opensuse on this computer, and there was Windows 10 
working properly.
Any suggestion is welcome...
