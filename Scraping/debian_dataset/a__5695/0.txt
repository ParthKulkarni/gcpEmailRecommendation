I think we're all done:
 - dillon: asachi replaced with amdahl in daily-build-setup.git, and
           authorized_keys refreshed.
 - asachi: daily builds decronned.
 - amdahl: ssh keys generated, di-autobuild.git cloned, daily builds cronned,
	   and one build performed for each arch to make sure both build and
           sync work fine.
