Dear all,
The arm64 porterbox called asachi.d.o is kindly hosted by Linaro. We
have just been notified that this hosting will come to and end soon.
We have therefore created a new arm64 porterbox at Conova called
amdahl.d.o. asachi.d.o will be decommissioned soon.
Please use this new porterbox instead of the old one. If you have any
important work in progress on asachi.d.o, it's time to fetch your data.
Remember that the porterboxes are NOT backuped, so we won't be able to
get your data once it has been decommissioned.
Regards,
Aurelien
