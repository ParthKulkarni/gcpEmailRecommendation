IIRC, the lists with private archives that nobody requested to
migrate to alioth-lists are also failing since last weekend,
i.e. alioth-lists-archive has only those lists with public
archives that nobody requested to migrate.
I'm not sure that we have a list of lists that haven't been
migrated, but I guess we can easily get that list.
OTOH, there are some packages that have users.alioth.debian.org
e-mail addresses in Maintainer and Uploaders, that may be worth
dealing with.
Cheers,
Alex
