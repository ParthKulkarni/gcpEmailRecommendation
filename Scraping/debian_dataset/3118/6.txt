We have switched to a common mailing list on lists.debian.org:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-tools/
But this list should not get bug reports and usual package maintainance
mail. It's a discussion list between team members.

Package maintainers are subscribed to team packages through the package
tracker (either individually or through the team):
https://tracker.debian.org/teams/pkg-security/

Except that we would want the forward to only forward user emails and not
automatic emails sent by the BTS, DAK, etc. since we already get those
through the package tracker. I'm not sure that they are willing to do
something like this, it would require local delivery to something like
procmail.
Still I'm ccing them to get their feedback on this.
Cheers,
