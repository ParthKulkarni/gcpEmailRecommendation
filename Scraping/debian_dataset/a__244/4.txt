Sure, if you think that's less effort, great: build Ian an ISO.
My experience of doing so is that there are quite often wrinkles that
make sure the resulting image is not actually what one wanted to test in
some subtle way.  That being the case, I'm _much_ more confident that
the preseed patch is changing just what you wanted to change, and
nothing more.
This is probably an indication that I don't build images often enough,
rather than anything else.
Cheers, Phil.
