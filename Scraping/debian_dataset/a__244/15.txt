I'm fine with trying to clean up the current mess we have in various
locations but I'm also not very thrilled with pushing such changes at
this point. I think I'll go for my proposed patch for stretch and
stashing yours in a buster branch (even if Philip already pushed a pu
branch) so that we don't forget about it againâ€¦
Sorry for not following up on your mail from Juneâ€¦
