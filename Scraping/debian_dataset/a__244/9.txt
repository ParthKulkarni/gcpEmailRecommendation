I just tried it with this image:
  http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/stretch_di_rc2/amd64/iso-cd/debian-stretch-DI-rc2-amd64-netinst.iso
adding this to the kernel command line (hit TAB at the boot menu):
  url=hands.com/d-i/bug/820818/preseed.cfg
and it drops the replacement resize.sh (now using Cyril's version) in
place.
BTW If you want to suggest somewhere to exit the script to avoid
touching your disks, I can add that to save you the effort.
Cheers, Phil.
P.S. This kludge is totally over-engineered, as the file is ready to be
replaced by the time the early command is run, so in this case the
checks and background loop are superfluous.
P.P.S. I think this is much less effort than building a new image, since a
newly built netinst would download the old partman-partition udeb from
the archive unless you start making more invasive changes.  You can
check that it's done the right thing by the time you get to the root
password prompts, flipping to a console and running:
  head -40 /lib/partman/lib/resize.sh
