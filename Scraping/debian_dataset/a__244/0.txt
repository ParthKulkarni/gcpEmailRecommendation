As I said, that's the very first time I look at this code, so I can't be
reasonably sure about anything, except for the fact the current work
doesn't seem to handle NVMe devices. :)
An alternate way of trying this would be to fetch a recent image (like
Stretch RC 2), editing the file in place, and adding an exit call before
the actual formatting. This would let you check the right device name
would be computed with this patch, while ensuring your filesystems are
left untouched.
