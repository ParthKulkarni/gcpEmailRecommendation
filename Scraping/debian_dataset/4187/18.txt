This is based on my past experience with multiple packages where same
criteria was interpreted differently by different ftp masters (At least
3 cases I can quote 1. node-babel-preset-env was rejected but
node-rollup was accepted, both can't be bootstrapped without a binary
upload first. 2. I was asked to make a single handlebars package, by
waldi, but it was accepted by Chris 3. There was long discussion on
node-babel but it was easily resolved when another ftp master was involved).
