The whole salsa thing is not something that I've been able to keep up
with. I have git repos locally and I've been moving things to salsa as
and when I do updates. You probably shouldn't trust what is on salsa
anyway unless we all start using signed commits and tags. The archive is
the only true record of packages.
I once looked at doing team maintenance on these packages but there was
enough extra policy regarding that team management that I did not have
the time to look at it. If you would like to adopt the package and move
it into the team then that's fine with me. I am also on the list of "low
nmu" maintainers. I am not interested in maintaining the package within
the team myself though.

Ok, I will close that in approx 15 minutes. (:
