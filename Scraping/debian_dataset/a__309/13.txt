It's super weird corner cases - those are hard to document... I looked
into those places in the policy, for example, and couldn't quite figure
it out:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#conflicting-binary-packages-conflicts
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#syntax-of-relationship-fields
The former does not mention any way to specify the actual version; it
probably should. The latter mentions the comparison operators but it
doesn't go into details into how to use them.
The developer's reference also does not seem to have anything about this
that I could find quickly.
So anyways - irl will upload a new package now, presumably -2 or more,
so i think << 0.242+git20151019-2~ is fine.
