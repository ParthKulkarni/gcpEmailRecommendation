That doesn't look foor. Apparently all older dailies were pruned and the
current one did not properly rsync either. Looking at other directories
I don't see any dailies either (except powerpc, which apparently is not
pruned).
barriere says this in its di/logs build log:
INFO: starting rsync
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(235)
[sender=3.1.2]
INFO: cleanup schroot ...
INFO: cleanup installer build directory ...
INFO: Exiting now ...
From /srv/d-i.debian.org/home/logs/buildd-forced-command.log we see this:
EXEC: unhide 20180716-00:25
UNKNOWN: rsync --server -logDtpre.iLsfxC . 20180716-00:43
UNKNOWN: rsync --server -logDtpre.iLsfxC . 20180716-00:53
UNKNOWN: rsync --server -logDtpre.iLsfxC . 20180716-01:10
UNKNOWN: rsync --server -logDtpre.iLsfxC . 20180716-02:05
So I suppose the options have changed. Oh well. The C at the end is new.
 -C, --cvs-exclude           auto-ignore files in the same way CVS does
I fudged that locally on dillon adding a "(C)?" to the wrapper script.
I'll also start another daily on barriere to see if it works now. I'll
try to commit the fix to the repo, too.
Kind regards
