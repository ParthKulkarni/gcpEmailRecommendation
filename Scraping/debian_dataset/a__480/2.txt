  Description     : small and non-interactive scripting language
 execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh; but its
 syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb
 program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other
 commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.
 .
 execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
 getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its
 syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has
 no security issues.
This is used for packaging s6.
