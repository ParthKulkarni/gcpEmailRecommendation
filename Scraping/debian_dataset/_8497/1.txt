Well, I was saying "don't bother"!  But it looks easier than I was
assuming.

Yes, this is an improvement if it might use HTTPS, though not if it
will always use HTTP.
But you missed the equivalent text in the debootstrap usage message:
      --unpack-tarball=T     acquire .debs from a tarball instead of http
                                                                     ^^^^
(Elsewhere in the usage output it already uses uppercase.)
I notice one other mention of wrong-case "https" in the debootstrap
sources (apart from changelog mentions): "functions" has a "keyring()"
function with this output:
         info KEYRING "Keyring file not available at %s; switching to https mirror %s" "$1" "$DEF_HTTPS_MIRROR"
                                                                      ^^^^^
