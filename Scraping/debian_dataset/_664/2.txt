Hi Holger,

Unless I'm missing something, I don't think that UDD has this. Whilst
we have a `packages` relation that can "detect" binNMUs (ie. SELECT *
FROM packages WHERE version != source_version) there is no timestamp
on this.
We have the "upload_history" relation but that will only give us an
upper limit (roughly 50% of the archive).
Regards,
