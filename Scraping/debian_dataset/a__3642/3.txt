This is not doing anything useful. A link "alias" is merely a free-form
string that you can put a more descriptive informative name in, which is
simply completely ignored in the kernel. So after the above command,
something like "ip link set dev foo0 up" just gives the error "Cannot
find device foo0".

That sounds interesting!
