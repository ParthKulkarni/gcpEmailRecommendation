This is what I assumed your new code does -- it seemed an obvious and
natural thing to do.
As Ben noticed, the post-up stanza above can't work as Linux doesn't allow
renaming interfaces at that point.  It can't work in pre-up either as
ifupdown wouldn't know about the rename.
Thus, what about this:
auto mac/00:16:0a:26:99:c6/=en0
iface en0 inet6 static
	address 3:1415:9265:3589:7932:3846:2643:3832/64
	gateway 3:1415:9265:3589::1
	rename
With the rename command taking an optional argument (the new name) that
defaults to the logical name (ie, after =).
Meow!
