Hi,
Since most of our QA is based on unstable, it is hard to tell when some
particular problem is *solved* when we got a number of extra packages in
sid that are RC-buggy and that you can "ignore".
Presumably this is an argument for having dedicated QA reports only for
testing, so you can tell the state of a particular issue only for the
next stable release.

Nothing is gratis.  Currently, our archive-wide QA is paying the price
by making it difficult to see when we can stop supporting deprecated
features (or which packages to focus on to fix it).
Plus our current garbage collection process for unstable is not gratis
either on volunteer time.  It involves someone identifying a package for
removal and then asking the FTP team to spend time removing it.
  If we automated the removal here (with some trivial stop gaps for
people in the situation you refer to), then we could save time from the
FTP team and distribute it to the people actively working on the packages.
