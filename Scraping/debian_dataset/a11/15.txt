yes, d/watch can use the qa.debian.org fakeupstream service to create a fake new release for every 
commit. I use this on projects that have very occasional (bugfix-only) commits and don't seem to be 
interested in actually making releases any more:
https://sources.debian.org/src/svn-all-fast-export/1.0.10+git20160822-3/debian/watch/
opts="uversionmangle=s/.*date=(\d{4})-(\d\d)-(\d\d)T.*/1.0.10+git$1$2$3/, \
    filenamemangle=s/.*date=(\d{4})-(\d\d)-(\d\d)T.*/1.0.10+git$1$2$3.tar.gz/" \
    https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/fakeupstream.cgi?upstream=github_commits_package_json/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git \
    .*/archive/(.*\.tar\.gz?.*)
A version 1.0.10+git20180406 would therefore appear from a commit made yesterday and if I were to package 
and upload that version, that would also be the upstream part of the version string I'd use. With uscan 
integration, tools like the UDD Maintainer Dashboard also show when new commits are made.
(Thanks to Paul Wise for creating this a couple of years ago when I was musing on how to track this sort 
of upstream)
cheers
Stuart
