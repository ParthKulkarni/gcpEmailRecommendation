I asked, but this did not result in a change.

Only when the version number on the web page does match to the version
number in the file. Which is often enough not the case.

But it is a difference between a github commit and a released zip
file. Even if it does not contain a version number, it is usually
somehow better curated.

Dito.

This file is three times of the size of than mpfit.tar.gz, containing
a lot more (versionized) files.

In that specific case, I didn't. However, also here I would resist in
using the plain RCS version, but rely on upstreams version curation.

That is the problem here. When the version number is unreliable, it
cannot be used.

Also with subtrees?

I would think that I am just a random example, and you probably wouldn't
want to give write access to all that are affected. But could you point
me to the documentation how to write a redirector? I could also do a
Merge Request.
