Hmm. But do we always have "console=$device" explicitly specified on
the command line on all targets when installing a new system? It's
not the case on sparc64, for example. But /var/run/console-device
contains /dev/ttyS0.

Hmm, ok. I need to test that on other targets than sparc64.

On sparc64, the kernel messages are printed on the serial console
after a fresh installation. But systemd does not start a getty
on the serial console. So users are unable to login.

A serial console with a getty which allows to login.

Do you mean that d-i is always booting with "console=ttyS0"?

The difference would be that d-i is not booting with console=ttyS0
but it's still using the serial console on sparc64.
