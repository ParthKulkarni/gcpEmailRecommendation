The point is: it doesn't need to be.  We need 90console for non-systemd
systems because sysvinit etc. are not able to automatically get the
console configuration from the kernel commande line.  Systemd, however,
is, and thus doesn't need anything in 90console.

Yes.

Yes, on purpose: it doesn't need to be.

Yes, that's on purpose: it has to be there on the command line for
kernel messages to get printed on ttyS0 anyway.

What do you mean by "serial console enabled by default"?  Perhaps that's
where there is misunderstanding.

I don't "prefer" something, I'm just saying how things are currently
supposed to work: somehow the kernel for d-i has console=ttyS0 on its
command line so that d-i gets its output on ttyS0, and d-i normally
copies what is passed to its kernel command line into the installed
system, so that the installed system behaves just like d-i behaved,
which is normally what the user expects.

Perhaps that "enabled by default" thing.
