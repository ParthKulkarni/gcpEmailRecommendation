We know the serial console during installation and can pass this information
to systemd. The kernel will use the firmware-provided console until systemd
takes over during boot. The first kernel messages you are seeing are always
printed using the firmware and not drivers in the kernel.
Again, please note that this is how the installation images set up the serial
console in the past. I merely updated the code to be able to set up the serial
console for systemd systems as well. Neither for SysVInit nor for Upstart is
there any code to pass anything on the kernel command line.

We might not need to adjust the baud rate as systemd calls agetty with:
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --keep-baud 115200,38400,9600 %I $TERM
and from the agetty manpage:
       baud_rate,...
              A comma-separated list of one or more baud rates.  Each time agetty receives a  BREAK  character
              it advances through the list, which is treated as if it were circular.
So, I guess this is fine as is. If some particular hardware needs adjustment, we
can make such adjustments later.

It worked until Wheezy because it still used SysVInit as the default init system for
which the code to set up the serial console was already in place. It was just missing
for systemd which is why it didn't work with the newer sparc64 images anymore. This
has now been fixed.
