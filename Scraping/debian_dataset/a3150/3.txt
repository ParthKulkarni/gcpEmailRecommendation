package: console-setup
version: 1.164
severity: normal
Hello Maintainer !
I have here one Desktop-PC-System and one minimal System plus rsnapshot-
package. Both are dist-upgraded from Jessie to Stretch with linux-
image-4.9.0-3-686-pae (4.9.30-2+deb9u). The bug is reproduceable. The changes 
of the console after "dpkg-reconfigure console-setup" are as expected, but 
after next boot they disappear - there is only the small font again, which I 
can't read well. Always I have to reconfigure the virtual console, when I want 
to work on it.
regards
Juwe (alias Harry Haller)
