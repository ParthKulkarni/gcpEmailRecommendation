It seems this bug is another reappearance of a known problem.  
Unfortunately, some smart people have tried to find the cause and have 
failed. The bug shows itself only when the system uses systemd.
For now you have two options: 1. you can include the command 'setupcon' 
in some script, for example in .(bash_)profile so that it is executed 
when you login or 2. you can remove systemd from your system,
