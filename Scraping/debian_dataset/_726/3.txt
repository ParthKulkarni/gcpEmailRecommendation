  Description     : convert images to text abusing Unicode
 This tool takes an image and converts it to a dot matrix text
 representation using the Unicode range U+2800..28FF.  This allows
 to hold an image at a resolution of 2×4 pixels per character used.
 .
 Certain fonts show those glyphs as a matrix of empty and filled circles,
 which is readable only at a very high DPI and/or font size.
 .
 Alas, most actual Braille readers provide only a single row, thus making
 these images hard to see by real blind people.
 .
 Also included is braillegraph, a simple graphing tool that makes
 single-series histograms.
It has been proposed, but rejected, to incorporate this into catimg (ITP
#852878) -- its upstream prefers KISS.  That tool produces images at a far
less resolution (2×2 or 4×4 times less) but in color.  Color looks nice, but
limits catimg's use to catting to a terminal, less -R or ansi2html, while
black&white brailleimg can be used anywhere Unicode text can go.
