This issue is indeed (too) well known, but I need to grow a better
understanding of various IPv6 configurations to get this fixed properly
in stable suites. (I'm making progress on this front but I have a few
busy weeks in front of me before getting back to this.)
In any case, this feels like something that might need to wait until
after r0 (can-defer in release team speak IIRC, cc'd).
