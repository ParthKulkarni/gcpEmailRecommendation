that looks good, thanks! I committed it with a few modifications and
told Salsa where to find the config (debian/.gitlab-ci.yml). I also
added a weekly run. Now I do expect this to be flaky because debootstrap
is not great at retrying when it sees failure (which is an
understatement), but I suppose it's better than nothing.
And as expected, autopkgtest actually fails because no-one tested it in
recent releases (presumably). Which is why one wants automation, right?
It's also possible that it just fails because the environment on the
runner is weird and doesn't allow unshare and the specific things
debootstrap's script tries to test... Which would be unfortunate. (It
fails with a different error on my machine.)
The failing job can be found here:

Kind regards
