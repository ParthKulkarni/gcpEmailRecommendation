The point is to make sure I don't make changes to upstream by mistake.

The goal is to check that all my changes to the packaging are
intentional, again. I find it easier this way, I appreciate other people
find it easier the other way round.

Me too. My point is that this thread encourages criticism of the 3.0
source format. Most participants in this thread are not quite happy (or
quite unhappy?) with this format, but like often presumably people who
*are* happy with the format will not speak up.
I would not like the readers of the thread to come to the conclusion
that the majority is unhappy with the format, because it's not a poll.
My "Feedback on 3.0 source format problems" is that I have nothing to
declare. I take note of the various tools that have been mentioned and
will look at whether they can enhance my packaging experience when time
permits...
Kind regards, Thibaut.
