Not sure, but [1] says that it should be sufficient to add all console 
devices to the kernel command line for systemd to detect and activate 
them, e.g. `console=ttyS0,9600n8` - which includes port and configuration.
This worked for me on non-SPARC machines (on HP C and J class machines 
where it is added by palo derived from the firmware setting, POWER5 
machines via yaboot configuration, Alpha machines through SRM boot 
command, etc.) with systemd, but I can't remember if I explicitly 
configured this on the Ultra 10 or SunFire V245 I used for testing your 
installer images.
I think headless Sun UltraSPARC systems - and maybe others like HP 
Itanium systems, too - will activate the serial console automatically 
without explicit configuration in the kernel command line - at least for 
kernel messages - but without an explicit serial console configuration 
in the kernel command line, systemd might not get the message.
As alternative, [1] also explains how to configure systemd directly via 
a systemd unit further below (in "Serial Terminals").
Or does systemd not enable a serial console for the mentioned users 
despite using a serial console configuration in the kernel command line?
Cheers,
