Well, debian-installer already needs to know about that, to be able to
pass to the installed system the parameters which were given to boot the
installer itself.

Well, your solution is somehow a "quick hack": enabling serial console
automatically already works "for all archs", there is just something
which doesn't happen to work in your case, and AIUI it's writing on the
installed system the kernel parameters which were passed to boot d-i.
And that does need to be fixed for a lot more things than just the
serial console, so it should really be worked on.
Or is there really no way on your system for d-i to be able to write
down the parameters to be passed to the kernel for the installed system?
