It's hardly a "glaring omission" that we don't list *explicitly*:
 * we don't want reiser4-specific reports
 * we don't want Ubuntu installation reports
 * we don't want installation reports about other modified images
You're reading the "Installation Guide for Debian", not the
"Installation Guide for every unofficial user-modified version of
Debian". The docs are meant to describe how to install Debian using
Debian's installer - is that not obvious?

I understand that you're working on reiser4 stuff and you'd like to
publicise it - that's cool and I hope it's working well for you! But
spamming us here is *not* helping. OK?
