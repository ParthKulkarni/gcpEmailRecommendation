Hi,

That doesn't mean that everything built on top of it has to be reported
on Debian mailing lists and bug tracker. See derivative distributions,
they have their own issue tracker, and only forward specific issues.

If you want to reply to submitters/maintainers, reply to specific bug
reports/threads, instead of sending lengthy mails to other people?

I haven't put words in your mouth and suggested you were requesting some
support. I'm just not convinced such reports are useful. If you
encounter specific issues, report specific bug reports against the
relevant component.
debian-boot@ isn't and shouldn't be the destination of each and every
thing connected to, or merely using, Debian Installer.

Sure, with official images.

I could be adding a specific ‚Äúwe don't need reiser4-specific reports‚Äù
there, but I would hope this isn't needed, since the only submitter of
such reports against images we don't build, publish, or support, seems
to be you.
Thanks for your cooperation.
KiBi.
