Yeah, that would work too, although you'd need to use a different
comparison function for dependencies than for determining the default
version of a package to install.  I'm not sure which is less confusing;
it's kind of confusing either way.

Well, it also has the function of getting rid of the old package and being
part of the normal upgrade path.  The latter is important.  If the
previous version had major data loss or security issues, introducing a new
package with a different name doesn't have the semantics you want.
