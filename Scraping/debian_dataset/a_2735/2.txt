Hi,
It seems that public-suffix.txt from mozilla fundation is embeded in a
few package.
The Public Suffix List is a catalog of certain Internet domain names.
The term is also known by the form effective top-level domain (eTLD).
The Mozilla Foundation maintains suffix list for the security and
privacy policies of its Firefox web browser, though it is available
for other uses under the Mozilla Public License (MPL).
This list is therefore security sensitive.
I suppose the way to go is to create a data package and get a MBF
after getting a consensus here.
Any volontuers for the packaging ?
