Hi Joel,
I think so, but I'm not sure that is the only deviation from the base64
API. I can have a look later at the wrapper I wrote to adjust the API,
if I still have them, I may have simply rewritten the functions. But it
should not be hard to check that `b58encode` and `b58decode` behave the
same as their base64 counterparts.
Cheers,
Dan
