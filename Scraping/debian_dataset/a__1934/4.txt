Source: apache2
Version: 2.4.25-3+deb9u3
Severity: wishlist
It's unclear to me why the http2 module in the Apache2 debian package
doesn't *actually* enable the http2 *protocol*.
Maybe I don't understand this right, but it seems to me that to enable
http2 in apache/Debian, you  need to do the following:
    a2enmod http2
But then also add some configuration blurb like this somewhere:
    Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
The above configuration will enable HTTP/2 over TLS (h2) and HTTP/2
over TCP (h2c, cleartext) then keep the http/1.1 as a
backwards-compatibility option.
Why isn't this part of /etc/apache2/mods-available/http2.conf? It
seems to me if you want to enable HTTP2 on the server, you'd expect
this to just turn on as well. I can imagine that people may want to
enable only on *some* virtual hosts, but then that config can be
commented out or disabled and added to virtual host as needed. Or it
can be disabled in the relevant vhosts as well.
It could also be a good place to have, commented out, sample H2Push
configurations as well... e.g.
# # HTTP/2 push configuration
#
# H2Push          on
#
# # Default Priority Rule
#
# H2PushPriority * After 16
#
# # More complex ruleset:
#
# H2PushPriority  *                       after
# H2PushPriority  text/css                before
# H2PushPriority  image/jpeg              after   32
# H2PushPriority  image/png               after   32
# H2PushPriority  application/javascript  interleaved
#
# # Configure some stylesheet and script to be pushed by the webserver
#
# <FilesMatch "\.html$">
#     Header add Link "</style.css>; rel=preload; as=style"
#     Header add Link "</script.js>; rel=preload; as=script"
# </FilesMatch>

What do you think?
