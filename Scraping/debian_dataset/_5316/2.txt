I would be all for doing it the other way around: First address the
remaining usability and completeness issues in ucf and then happily
deprecate dpkg conffile handling in favor of having ucf as the default
for conffile handling. It's just _WAY_ superior, more flexible and
less ugly.
Having the possibility to remove conffile handling fromd dpkg proper
in, let's say five releases (a decate of wall-calendar time) would
also reduce the maintenance burden on the dpkg maintainers.
Greetings
