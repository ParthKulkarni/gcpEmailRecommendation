I'd like to keep the documentation of extra because, for some time to
come, there will be a lot of packages in the wild that will have that
priority in their control files (even if they've been overridden by
ftp-master in the archive metadata).  We therefore need to document that
the priority still exists.
Hm, it occurs to me that this wording should probably explicitly say that
the extra priority should be treated the same as optional if it appears
anywhere (although the archive-wide override change will mostly take care
of that).
