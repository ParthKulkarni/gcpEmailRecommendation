I've merged this patch for the next release.  The only change from my
proposed wording was that I added this sentence to the description of
extra, just to be clear how to treat any packages found in the wild with
that priority:
    This priority should be treated as equivalent to optional.
I don't think this will change anything, but it seemed best to be clear.
The upgrading-checklist entry for this change:
      <varlistentry>
        <term>2.5</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Priorities are now used only for controlling which packages
            are part of a minimal or standard Debian installation and
            should be selected based on functionality provided directly to
            users (so nearly all shared libraries should have a priority
            of <literal>optional</literal>).  Packages may now depend on
            packages with a lower priority.
          </para>
          <para>
            The <literal>extra</literal> priority has been deprecated and
            should be treated as equivalent to
            <literal>optional</literal>.  All <literal>extra</literal>
            priorities should be changed to <literal>optional</literal>.
            Packages with a priority of <literal>optional</literal> may
            conflict with each other (but packages that both have a
            priority of <literal>standard</literal> or higher still may
            not conflict).
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
