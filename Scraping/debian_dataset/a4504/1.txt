Sure, I'll be happy to do this! Victor, do you have a .po file which you
could send to me? Then I'll integrate this into iso-codes so that the
country names are available in Tajik as well.
If you do not have a .po file yet or if you need further help from me,
please do not hesitate to contact me.
Regards,
Tobias
