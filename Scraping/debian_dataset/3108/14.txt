I think the teams would be different but complementary. In addition
the pkg-security team could be the place for packaging tools that
adversaries might use to violate privacy and could be used by the
privacy-team to audit Debian for privacy. Or, perhaps pkg-privacy-team
depending on their scope.
Is anyone interested in facilitating a privacy-team BoF at DebConf18?
A related thing is the Debian & GDPR work, but that is mostly being
done by DSA and the DPL's GDPR delegate.
