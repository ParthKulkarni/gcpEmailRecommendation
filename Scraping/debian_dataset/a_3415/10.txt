Makes sense. How about:
Conflicts: python-duckduckgo2 (<= 0.242+git20151019-1)
This way we assume any newer upload of the package will remove ia?
I'd be happy to do that upload, actually. I see the git repo used to be
on Alioth:
https://alioth-archive.debian.org/git/collab-maint/python-duckduckgo2.git.tar.xz
... but it hasn't been migrated to Salsa. Would you be okay to move this
in the Python module's team umbrella (as opposed to simply collab-maint)?

Sure, I'll file that anyways now.

Yeah, that's not RC material, as long as the bug is not forgotten in the
next upload of course. :)
