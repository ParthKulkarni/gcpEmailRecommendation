Yeah, this should probably have been brought up on debian-project,
if at allâ€¦

Not quite. Here are the relevant quotes:

  Hereby I inform you, that I uploaded NMU into DELAYED/15. Feel free to
  cancel it, providing rationale why it is not "reasonable".
  Quoting from TC (#746715):
          [... ] That includes merging reasonable contributions, and not
          reverting existing support without a compelling reason. [...]

  Sure. I will write draft summary of disagreement in a week or so into
  this bug.
  But until and unless CTTE overrules my decision, `runit-init' will be
  installable without uninstalling essential packages, either as
  pre-dependency of bin:init or as package, that provides `init'.
  `---
So I clearly read there:
 1. The maintainers can cancel the NMU (as is their right really),
    and provide a rationale.
 2. If 1. happens (and I understand, unless a compelling reason is put
    forward), he is stating that unless overruled he'll go forward with
    the plan to add runit support even if that implies adding a
    Â«Provides: initÂ» on one of the runit packages.

So, I've stated earlier, I think the NMU was probably socially rude,
and something I'd not consider doing. Procedurally? I guess it was
OKish, but I guess that's a consequence we get when people involved
the ctte to muddle the social and procedural fabric of the projectâ€¦
We are also talking about a change that affects only people who might
want to use runit as their init system. Compare that with, I don't
know, the merged-/usr deployment hack, which is the new irreversible
default, and which breaks stuff, and where people have been warning
about for a long timeâ€¦

Oh, wowâ€¦
