if you had booted in UEFI mode rather than legacy compatibility mode,
grub should have said:
"Installing for x86_64-efi platform."
i386-pc platform means it is running in legacy mode.
You really should boot the installer in UEFI mode instead.
Usually the boot menu will list the same USB key twice.  Once for UEFI
boot and once for legacy boot.
