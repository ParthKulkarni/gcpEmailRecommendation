Hi Bastian
I sponsored Lumin's original upload of Julia 1.0.0-1 and worked with him 
closely, reviewing the commits leading up to the upload.  In the 
meantime, Lumin has become a Debian Developer and uploaded the 
subsequent versions himself, although still with some input and testing 
from me.
I thought Lumin had made it clear enough that being able to obtain a 
stacktrace from within Julia is actually a feature [1].  One of Julia's 
tests checks this, and hence autopkgtests fail if debug symbols are 
missing from sys.so, which is compiled from .jl files, not C/CXX source.
However, Lumin has now updated the comments in debian/rules [2] to be 
more explicit.
