I am happy to consider it.  Please file a bug against debhelper for it,
so I do not forget about it. :)
Bonus if you can point to some existing cases where wildcard support
would have worked or where you had to use the above tool instead.

It can always be disabled by disabling the helper.  The procedure for
that (assuming no existing overrides exists) is in essence:
  echo '# Disable dh_missing' >> debian/rules
  echo 'override_dh_missing:' >> debian/rules
