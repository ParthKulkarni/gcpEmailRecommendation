As I planned to create a related wishlist bug report about that issue:
Agreed.
The --fail-missing option saved my lower back many times in the past,
even when it was placed in dh_install. Therefore I'm certain it would
help other people as well. In other words, I was about to suggest to
make --list-missing the default in 11, and switch to --fail-missing
in 12. Those who somehow manage to trigger a false negative (possibly
dracut is one of these) would have to use a --ignore-missing override
(not yet implemented) then, or use a more elaborate ignore mechanism:
That is debian/not-installed which should no longer ignore file paths
then, also drop the warning on the usage of this file. There are often
files that should not go into a package, *.la files from library
packaging to begin with. Given the suggested policy change above, their
number will increase. Overriding dh_install defeats readability of
debian/rules, also -X might hit more files than intended.

PS: Talking about "planned to create a wishlist bug report" ... after
losing several hours while fiddling with dh_systemd_* I saw the need for
a cleanup. Glad to see it's already underway.
