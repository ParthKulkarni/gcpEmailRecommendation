Hi Chris,

Indeed, but in this case it was simply a .mo file based on a latin1
encoding instead of UTF8, while the main program was loading/running
the files/translations always in utf8.
It is fixed already, there was a bug in the source tar ball that was
fixed a few hours after the initial release, but I got the bad one :-(
Upload of new calibre done.
Norbert
