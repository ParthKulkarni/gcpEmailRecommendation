Control: tags -1 + patch
Hi,
Attached is a minimal patch intended to implement SHA256 verification.
It would depend on libdebian-installer being patched first (#856210) and
bumping the soname to 5.
"#define SHA256_HEX_LENGTH 64" is made explicit as possible so that one
remembers to increase it if changing SHA256 to SHA512 in the future.  A
more thorough rework of this code might store the hash type (as an enum)
and length, in the di_package struct instead.
Thanks,
Regards,
