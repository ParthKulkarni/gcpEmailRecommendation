It worked on 0 out of the 2 systems I tried it on.
One is running jessie (in LTS), so none of the changelogs for security
updates are available.  (This problem doesn't occur for stretch because
security updates get copied into proposed-updates.)
The other is running unstable, and the package I tried was slightly
older than the version in the archive.
I think we would need to fix these back-end problems before relying on
apt-get changelog.
