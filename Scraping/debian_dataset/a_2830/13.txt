A local admin could choose to tell dpkg to not install
/usr/share/doc/*/*changelog* via the path-exclude option. Alas, I have
not been able to get this to work when I last tried that two and a
half years ago. The corresponding wishlist bug was a five-digit number
bug from the last millennium.
Has anybody gotten dpkg path-exclude to work?
