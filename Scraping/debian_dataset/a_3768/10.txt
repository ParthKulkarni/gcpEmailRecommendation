Wrong.
Which bit of this reply is not clear to you?
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=857322#10
Did you perhaps miss the fact that the two bugs had been merged?
Without the merged bug, there is no patch, so in that case you would
have nothing to complain about (maintainers are _NOT_ required to fix
such bugs, but should not reject patches without good reason).
With the merged bug, we have a patch that is described as "prelimiary"
and suggests a way of testing it. :
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=857322#25
Therefore it needs testing before one could legitimately complain about
the maintainer blocking it.
Have you contributed to that testing?
If so, why is that not visible in the bug?
If not, how about putting your efforts into something useful (testing),
rather than wasting your and our time with this intemperate drivel?
Cheers, Phil.
