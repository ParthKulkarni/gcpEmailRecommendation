Well done.
I note that your init script is not the same as the one in the bug's
patch, and is also not the same as the one that reverting the commit you
were on about would have resurrected.
I would hope that between the three versions there is one (or a
combination) that would function both on a system where the systemd
support files are present (as in the Debian package) and where they are
absent (as is the case in yours). If not, presumably that would not take
a vast effort to achieve.
That being the case, I'd suggest that you mail the bug with your script
attached, pointing out the interesting differences between it and the
existing patch, and perhaps offering to help testing the result.
I sincerely hope that doing that would result a rather happier outcome
than your efforts to date seem to have achieved.
Cheers, Phil.
