  Description     : Simple and secure password management and retrieval system
The password manager named "assword" has been renamed "impass" as of
version 0.12.  I plan to upload a new version to debian shortly,
complete with a dummy transitional "assword" package.
The description of impass is (not surprisingly) basically the same as
the description of assword:
 Impass is a secure password manager that relies on your OpenPGP key
 for security and is designed to integrate in a minimal fashion into
 any X11 window manager.
 .
 Passwords and context strings are stored in a single
 OpenPGP-encrypted and signed file (meaning entry contexts are not
 exposed to the filesystem).  Along with a simple command-line
 interface, there is a streamlined GUI meant for X11 window manager
 integration.  When invoked, the GUI produces a prompt to search
 stored contexts.  New entries can also easily be created.  Passwords
 are securely retrieved without displaying on the screen.  Multiple
 retrieval methods are available, including auto-typing them directly
 into an X11 window (default), or inserting them into the X11 clipboard.
