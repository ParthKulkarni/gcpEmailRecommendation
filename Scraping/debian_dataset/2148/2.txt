If by "in favour" you mean in favour of using sbuild instead of pbuilder
on your own machine, I think James' point was that the fact that sbuild
is run on the buildds is a reason *not* to run it locally.
Your package will be built using sbuild on the buildds anyway, so
testing with pbuilder locally could expose bugs.
(disclaimer: I use sbuild)
