Maybe I should also point out that schroot is just the *default* sbuild chroot
backend.  It also supports the "sudo" mode (which essentially just uses "sudo
chroot") and the autopkgtest mode which allows sbuild to build packages in any
environment that autopkgtest provides like lxc, lxd, qemu, ssh...
And then there is also a patch for adding a backend using Linux user namespaces
which is a lightweight replacement of lxc-usernsexec and unshare that allows to
easily do unprivileged package builds without the need of an suid binary like
schroot:

And then there is also the effort to add this as a backend to autopkgtest:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=844459
Work on all of this stalled a bit because of lack of time. I don't want to drag
this thread further into this direction, so if you are interested in any of
this, just get in touch with me off-list.
Thanks!
cheers, josch
