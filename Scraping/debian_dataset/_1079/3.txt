I tried the latest current netinstall-image first from today, which supported
only FAT-filesystems and showed an error-message about LVM-modules, then used
this older one instead:

Comments/Problems:
This is a quite compact PC, my former build- and virt-server,  for my
sponsoring family, who enabled me to do what I am interested in myself
_all_of_the_time_, without being too poor and too limited financially. It is
going to run with Ubuntu-Mate 18.04 LTS, should work according to my
estimation, low-profile USB3 controller-card was added (recommended).
First problem I encountered, was that the PC was by default equipped with a
non-linux haddrive, it just would not boot the kernel with GRUB, but simply
blocked and did nothing at all or threw error-messages, a System from the
Vista-era, the original disk was: MDL: WD1600AAJS - 75M0A0, S/N: WD -
WMAV3D340689
The disk was replaced with a smaller Seagate-disk, which resolved the
boot-issue, works just fine now.
Because of the boot-problems I fell back to Debian stable 9.4 and found there
is still the problem of missing flexibility, like in this case, when there is
no harddisk-boot possible, one would like to boot from USB-disk instead, but
this becomes problematic, when you install from USB onto another USB-disk, I
mentioned the problem in an earlier report already.
If you remove the installation-medium, the device-name of the second
USB-disk changes, so GRUB will not boot anymore, one has to work around the
issue by editing the menu-entry manually say change the root-partition from
sdc1 to sdb1, then upon successful boot run update-grub, so the change
becomes permanent (or run update-grub as root before removing the
install-disk).
So it is possible to work around, but too complicated for most people,
please try to fix this for the upcoming Buster-release.
