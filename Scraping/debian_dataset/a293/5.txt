Totally possible.

In the example above, while in Wheezy, the dependency was perfectly
correct. It became wrong because of the epoch bump (for no obvious
reason). For software we distribute ourselves, this change can be caught
at some point before the release (or by automation, like you suggest),
but for people packaging stuff outside Debian, this can be far more
painful.
