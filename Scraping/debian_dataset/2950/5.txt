Hello,
the Alba[1] synchrotron radiation facilities, recently switch to
Debian for their OS. They are part of the Tango[2] control system
community which contain most of the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facilities and others[3]. At least three instituts have already
choosen Debian (partially Soleil, ESRF, petraIII, and Alba).
The next meeting of this community will be held in Prague[4] next
week. During this meeting, Alba will present their plan about
packaging "Collaborative and automated Packaging"[5].
The idea is to propose a pipeline via a .gitlab-ci.yml[6] file which
should be added to the upstream repository and/or in a repository
dedicated to packaging, in order to generate debian packages ready to
install software on their facility or ready to upload into Debian.
Since I am not at all a specialist of gitlab-ci, I would like your
advice on the pipeline, and also on the numbering scheme propose by
Alba. In fact all feedback which should smooth the upstream to debian
flow.
Thanks for considering.
Frederic
