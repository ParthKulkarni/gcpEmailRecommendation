You'd be interested in NTPsec (https://www.ntpsec.org/) then, which is a
project to review and sanitize ntpd without downsides prevalent in most
replacements (such as same-week accuracy or no managing clock drift).
Sadly, it's not a part of stretch or even unstable yet:

Using a local daemon means:
* less burden on public servers or the network
* if there's a problem, your machines will be consistent at least between
  them, which is usually a bigger concern than being globally accurate
