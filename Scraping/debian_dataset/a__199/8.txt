If anything, having ntpdate call hwclock might make sense.
Having ntpdate clear the unsynced flag doesn't make sense since it
would start writing a time to the RTC each 11 minutes, and as Ben
said you have no idea which of the 2 clocks is the most correct
one.
I can also understand that systemd doesn't set the clock for just
the same reason. Either the clock is synched and it's written, or
it's not suched, it's unknown which one is the most correct, and
it's not written.
