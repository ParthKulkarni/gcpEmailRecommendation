The kernel actually does the periodic setting automatically, so long as
the NTP server reports that it's synchronised (by clearing STA_UNSYNC
in timex::status).
(The kernel will only set one RTC device, which is specified in the
build config.  On systems that have multiple RTCs and only one of them
works (e.g.Â the one in the SoC doesn't have battery power but the one
in the PMIC does) this may not work properly.  It may be fixable by
disabling the broken RTC in the device tree.)

It looks like it does iff the RTC is set to UTC:
        /*
         * An unset STA_UNSYNC will enable the kernel's 11-minute mode,
         * which syncs the system time periodically to the RTC.
         *
         * In case the RTC runs in local time, never touch the RTC,
         * we have no way to properly handle daylight saving changes and
         * mobile devices moving between time zones.
         */
        if (m->rtc_local_time)
                tmx.status |= STA_UNSYNC;

But ntpd is also known to have a large amount of code written without
as much regard for security as one would hope.  It seems like an
unnecessary risk for most systems.

This sentence contradicts itself - no actually it doesn't.
