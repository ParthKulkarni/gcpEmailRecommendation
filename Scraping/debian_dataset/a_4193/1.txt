Didn't we already lose enough time with this utterly pointless GR?
If I, as a dirty foreigner, knew the etymology of -man without having to
look it up, it wouldn't be too hard for GR proposers to do a bit of
research.  But then, perhaps we should have another GR to purge from all
de.po files all translations to -f√ºhrer because of that one F√ºhrer?
With that logic, you can as well ban the letter N and all words that include
-gun-.  I heard such word games are all the rage these days.
The GR replaced the text of the Constitution, it did not forbid using the
synonym in other communication -- especially when the particular usage
matches both definitions of the word (both the etymological one, and the one
that implies gender), as Didier happens to be male.  Likewise, had paultag
taken this position, a mail from lamby that puts "chaircat" or "chairgod"
(assuming #d-devel wisdom is true) would be correct.
Bottom line: this mailing list is not a place to shame people about
following or not a particular approach to genders.
Meow!
