This is good to hear. While I like all that I read about Gentoo, I do
not know about how well equipped it is with packages in computational
biology [edit: I had a look at
https://packages.gentoo.org/categories/sci-biology and am impressed,
well done!]. This is where BioConda (bioconda.github.io) is very strong
now. And while the Conda community gets increasingly sophisticated with
their packaging, we can decide to either just let them go for it or to
find ways to compete. These folks start as low as libz, i.e. just above
libc, really. I hence tend to think that it is something that we as a
Linux distribution should care about.
I have followed Johanness' link to
https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/Spec/InstallBootstrap but frankly do
not yet know how to transform that into something computational
biologists would like to use and trust more than Conda. It would all
start with cross-distribution packages of dpkg, right? And the testing
infrastructure of Debian would need to care for such
off-root-experiences, too. I do not see that just around the corner.
Best,
Steffen
