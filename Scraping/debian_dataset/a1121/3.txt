I am one of a few guys behind that project.  Gentoo Prefix with its own
libc runs on Debian very well, the explicity tested distributions are
listed at,
  https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Prefix/libc#Tested_distributions
The highlights are:
  1. you can compile almost any package available in Gentoo.
  2. you can run x86 Gentoo Prefix on a amd64 Debian, thus another form
     of multiarch.
The downside compared to Debian and any binary distribution is that,
everything need to be compiled from source.  That's slow.
A preliminary draft has been prepared to discuss its use on HPC
environments:
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02742
Alternative projects are _spack_ and _easybuild_, with slightly
different motivations and implementations.
Cheers,
Benda
