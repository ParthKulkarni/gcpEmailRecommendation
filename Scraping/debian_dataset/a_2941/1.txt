Ideally you should find some DDs and work with them to set up those
projects (that was under collab-maint group before)
under Salsa's Debian group [1].
If you are among one of package's contributors, please ask a DD for
help to grant you the write access for the corresponding
repository. You may request a Master role or a Developer role,
depending on how involved you are for this package.
If you don't want to retrieve such permission and only (e.g., you are
only an occasional contributor), you may still open a
Merge Request and ask another one who have the permission to accept
merges (often the package maintainers but other
DDs have such right too) to accept  that Merge Request.
Setting up a repository under the namespace of yourself is possible
and acceptable; however, that approach might not be
recommended since by default no one else (even DDs) may modify this
repo, which brings negative effect when doing
collaborative maintenance.
