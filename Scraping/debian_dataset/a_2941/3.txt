Furthermore, naming the repository like the source package makes it
easier to forward mails via the package tracker. You can just send
the commit notifications to dispatch@tracker.debian.org. Otherwise
you have to use something like dispatch+<source>_vcs@tracker.debian.org
to override the automatic guess of the package name.
