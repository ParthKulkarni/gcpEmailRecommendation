For some people, getting packages via the Internet after installation is not an option.  For example, air-gapped high-security environments, or folks with very slow Internet connections (does anyone remember 9600 baud modems?).
Can we acknowledge such situations in the proposed changes?  For them, at least, the question in the subject line is still relevant (perhaps with ‚ÄúCD‚Äù changed to ‚ÄúDVD‚Äù, giving a nod to changing times).
