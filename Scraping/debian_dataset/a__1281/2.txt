Package: debian-installer
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
I tested Debian testing installer the 4 september 2018
At one step, the installer asks for setting the root password.
I pressed Enter, without entering any password, and the installer went to the
next step (creating user accounts)
I tried to fix this by restarting at a previous step (network configuration)
but the root password step doesn't show anymore. It jumps to user account
creation step directly after network configuration.
Bugs are :
- maybe empty root password should not be allowed
- the root password setting step should be replayable
