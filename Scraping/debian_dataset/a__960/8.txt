Perhaps it is.  The symptoms seem similar.
Obviously it's not ideal that systemd-shim is orphaned.  I would like
to fix this rather than just working around it by putting my account
in some appropriate config files.
Can anyone suggest a better strategy than a git bisect on the systemd
package source code ?  I have frankly no idea what to expect from the
communication between systemd-shim and systemd-logind, or even where
to look for logs.
I found this in my .xsession-errors:
 dbus-update-activation-environment: systemd --user not found, ignoring --systemd argument
And this in my Xorg.0.log:
 Xorg.0.log:[     8.993] (II) systemd-logind: logind integration requires -keeptty and -keeptty was not provided, disabling logind integration
I'm not sure I need "logind integration" in my X server but perhaps I
do ?

Thanks for the comprehensive explanation.

In fact I didn't have libpam-systemd installed for some strange
reason, but installing it hasn't helped.  (All the symptoms I report
above are with it installed.)
