The rough way things work is that network-manager asks policykit if
ijackson is allowed to do <action>. If I recall correctly, for most
networky (and removable media things), the default policykit
configuration is that 'local logged in users' are allowed to do this.
logind is asked if ijackson is logged in as a local user or as a remote
user. And the message trickles back the same way.
There is also somewhere iirc a configuration bit to require a password
on the way.

That would probably be some policykit configuration file you can do this

I like your attitude of fixing the general case, and I do have the same
suspicion as you.
I do think mbiebl's debugging start point is good.
