Did you ever get to the root of this?
I am having the same kind of problem (no way to control networking,
removable media, power settings) and a similar set-up (sysvinit,
lightdm, cinnamon). I have been experiencing these kind of problems for
months, but usually they would go away after an apt-get upgrade. Not
now, and I am afraid that we will ship stretch with this problem.
