Hi,
I am looking into switching apache2/libapr/libaprutil from explicit -dbg 
packages to the automatic dbgsym packages. And since I have included a 
README.backtrace in apache2, I wonder how one describes to a sysadmin that 
has no clue about software development which dbgsym packages they need to 
install.
There is of course the problem that there are many modules for apache2, 
and also libaprutil1 has some plugins. So the obvious approach of 
recommending to install all dbgsym packages that may be relevant is not 
feasible.
Is there some tool that parses /proc/maps and the build-ids fields from 
the apt repository to determine which dbgsym packages to install?
Cheers,
Stefan
