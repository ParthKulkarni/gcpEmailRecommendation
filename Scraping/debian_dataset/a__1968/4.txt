is there any advantage of this?
the source package currently only builds a single binary package (and i
don't expect this to change).
so i think that having different version numbers for source and binary
package to only add complexity to the packaging with little gain.
i have already uploaded to NEW yesterday (after the discussion here
seemed to indicate consensus on the epoch bump), but of course it's
awaiting ftp-masters' approval, so there is still time to re-upload.
