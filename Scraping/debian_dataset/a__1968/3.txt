stretch features a pd-csound binary package built from "csound" with a
version number "1:6.08.0~dfsg-1".
upstream has factored out this component into a separate project (and
therefore pd-csound is currently no more in buster), starting with a new
version (1.01.0).
as mandated by the policy, i'd like to discuss, whether an epoch bump
for the new source package "pd-csound" (to be "2:1.01.0-1") is
warranted, or indeed a good idea.
the first version of Csound in Debian seems to have been "3.484.0d-1"
(according to snapshot.d.o), with pd-csound appearing at "1:5.08.0.dfsg2-1".
the factored out project is relatively new, i don't know how the
versions will evolve.
