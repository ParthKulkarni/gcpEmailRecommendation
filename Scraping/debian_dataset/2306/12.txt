Looking at the above from Cloud Team member perspective I'd like to see this
done. I also know that JEB was suggesting something similar some time ago.
I don't think that any of the Cloud Team members or DDs would be against this
solution, but if they would is it should be know, that's why cross post to
debian-cloud (sorry for this) so people can vice their opinion.
At this point in time I'm not capable of helping with backends but I could
help with integrating db.d.o with our AWS account (I'm one of the admins)
however we'll choose to do it.
From experience I also know that not too many non DD or DMs are having access to
those (AWS,GCP) accounts. So focusing on those 2 groups should be sufficient
for start.
