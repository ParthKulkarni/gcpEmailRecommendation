I wouldn't characterise this as a hack, it is a legitimate way to do things.

FTR, this is currently this set of changes:
https://patches.ubuntu.com/g/gnome-calculator/gnome-calculator_1:3.30.0-1ubuntu1.patch

An alternative might be for Launchpad to allow whitelisted downgrades
of source packages (dropping the epoch) (zero idea how feasible that
is) and then a dpkg-vendor conditional in debian/rules to re-add the
epoch to the binary packages when they are being built for Ubuntu.
This would result in zero change to Debian binary packages, Ubuntu
binary packages to continue to use the epoch, the source package to be
in sync and require zero busywork in Ubuntu and everyone should be
happy (except maybe the Launchpad team).
