Patch implementing this attached.

Implemented in arch-test 0.11, via -c $CHROOT.  There are rumours incoming
qemu has some other magic that makes this dance not required, too.

My stab at the patch gives only a terse error message, it's obvious how to
extend it.

As it takes only a single line to implement this fallback, it's a no-brainer
to include it.
Thus, I'm attaching three patches:
1. run in_target /bin/true before anything else in the second stage
2. check arch-test if installed
3. Recommend: arch-test
(Dropped #693219 from CC, it's about improving the prose of error messages,
thus these patches don't belong there.)
Meow!

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Recommend arch-test.
Machines that run debootstrap in non-d-i scenarios do this for a chroot or
lxc or similar guest, thus can be assumed to have abundant storage, making
accurate error messages worth a small extra package.
