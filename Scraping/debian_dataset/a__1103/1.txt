control so fast
Speaking as someone who has had his world shattered by betrayal and 
breach of trust by an organisation (not Debian related), I can 
completely understand how any correspondence opens old wounds.
I am not trying to justify anything here; only to say that I understand 
it from *both* sides, and (I may be projecting my own experiences into 
this too much) can see how things can get out of
An organisation, and its ideals can be your friend (an idol? a belief? a 
religion?).Â  You invest a lot in that organisation - you live your life 
through it.
You contribute, you work hard and in return you are appreciated; you are 
shown to be valued, to have worth.Â  oh how good it feels to have someone 
tell you that when outside that organisation you are taken for granted, 
derided, bullied, and as a result you have very low self esteem.
When that organisation fractures or turns away from your aligned 
beliefs; or when something nasty happens and the organisation doesn't 
defend you from those within your trust / belief is shattered in an instant.
There can be no reconciliation, no forgiveness, at best there can be 
acceptance, to move on,Â  lick your wounds and start a new life.
You armour yourself with righteousness, you weave stories of what did 
happen (or what did happen when from your viewpoint when hurting) to 
shield you from the pain.
You put it in a box at the back of your mind and do not ever want to go 
there again.
Years later you still wake at night, replaying the events over and over 
again in your head.Â  you tell yourself you did the right thing to leave, 
you conclude that given the same events again you would probably have 
done the same things, acted the same way but wish that you could have 
acted without as much venom.
You go from your usual calm and controlled self to burning hate monster 
instantly.Â  You lash out, 'how dare you cause me to relive all this 
pain?'.Â  'leave me alone - I have told you before; go away'
Some days later when you look back on this you are not proud of what you 
did, but the pain is back, why should I care about others who have just 
hurt me again?
These wounds do not heal, they fester and grow deeper over time. They 
have been reopened and alongside them sits a new gash in your heart.
You armour yourself with righteousness, you weave stories of what did 
happen (or what did happen when from your viewpoint when hurting) to 
shield you from the pain.

the same things, acted the same way but wish that you could have acted 
without as much venom.
In time you get more and more trouble free nights of sleep.
In time...
