Sure, but.....as far as I know, I didn't change anything in my usual
workflow.
I mostly use:
git add debian/changelog ; debcommit -a --release ; git push ; git push --tags
whenever I upload a new release for a package and, this, for months,
if not years.
Has something else changed elsewhere to explain that his suddenly
started to become a problem?
