Thanks for your work, Thomas, and yes I hope someone hires you and other
skilled maintainers to continue OpenStack in Debian.
Nadia Eghbal's work documenting the state of critical infrastructure
<URL:https://medium.com/@nayafia/how-i-stumbled-upon-the-internet-s-biggest-blind-spot-b9aa23618c58#.str97fkhj>
has led her to create a guide for seeking funding for crucial
free-software infrastructure
<URL:https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand>.
For those parties who are profiting from OpenStack, or any other
free-software project, you need to read “Roads and Bridges”
<URL:http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure>
and *fund* the maintenance of this infrastructure.
Stories like Thomas's should gavlanise you to put sustained funding in
for the projects that provide your own lifeblood. Step up, join with
others, and make this right.
