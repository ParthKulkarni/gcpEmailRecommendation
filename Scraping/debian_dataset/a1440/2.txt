Alexander's proposal makes sense when it comes to creating a minimalistic
system for example. 
This is however not the approach behind this tasks from tasksel; they have to 
serve a maximum of hardware and user configurations, and especially need to fit 
for unexperienced users. 
Experienced users or people with special requirements will have the knowledge,
how to make their system suitable for their needs.
That's not the scope of tasksel and its tasks.
So tagging this bug as wontfix
Holger
