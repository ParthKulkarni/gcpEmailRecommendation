Hi Adrian,
Quoting the page you linked to:
> This section only applies to systems using a custom kernel, where /usr is on a separate mount point from /. If you use the kernel packages provided by Debian, you are unaffected by this issue.
>From what I can tell in this text, keeping /usr on a separate mount
point _is_ indeed supported (as long as you are using a stock kernel
and a proper initramfs generator) - and as noted in my followup email,
installing Buster on a /usr volume works fine. Also, the Debian
installer provides /usr as an option when partitioning your disk. If
indeed maintaining /usr on a separate partition is completely
unsupported (which you indicate), it should be removed from
debian-installer; we shouldn't be suggesting broken scenarios to our
users.
Copying in the debian-boot mailing list to get your perspective on the
matter. I personally don't think we are ready for closing the bug just
yet, but it could very well be that it should be moved to liblz4-1
instead of lvm2.
