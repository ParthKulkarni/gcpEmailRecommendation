"out of date" has a specific meaning in the context of buildds: it means
that the latest version is not built.  Reverting back to a previous
version of librsvg would actually make all the arches "up to date" in
that lingo.

In this case not, but be aware that the archive software used in Debian
Ports doesn't have support for "cruft", which means that if a package
bumps its soname the old binaries are removed as soon as the last source
package building them disappear.

I at least had that impression even while being a bystander.  I do
recall Adrian mumbling about how annoying rust was for ports and I even
recall some discussion involving rsvg in it several months ago.
You really didn't understand that rsvg was a concerns for the ports
architectures?
