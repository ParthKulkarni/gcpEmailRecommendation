Perhaps we should quickly upload a revert, using the last good version of
librsvg, before things degrade?  Effectively removing librsvg on 11 archs
(not counting non-official ones) stops any GUI there.  Including proverbial
fvwm.
A regression of this scale shouldn't be done lightly.  So what about
reverting it now so things don't degrade, then having a flamewar what to do?
Meow!
