Hi Roger,
Roger Shimizu <rogershimizu@gmail.com> (2018-03-25):
> Do you have any suggestion, except adding udeb support to package flex?
It looks acceptable to me to use the static library in the udeb, so I've
tried building it against libfl.a, and that seems to do the job since
the libfl2 dependency goes away. I'm not sure it's reasonable to do that
for both the deb and the udeb, though; so I've looked into making it
conditional, and only building the udeb against the static library.
Unfortunately, it looks like the build system doesn't support out of
tree builds, so I've had to copy all files under build-{deb,udeb},
instead of just running ../configure, make, make install from there.
I've picked rsync to do this, but feel free to use anything else.
I've also chosen to clean things up using an override_dh_auto_clean
target, so that most modifications are seen at once in debian/rules, but
you may want to use debian/clean instead.
You'll find a patch series attached. I haven't tested the runtime
though.
Cheers,
