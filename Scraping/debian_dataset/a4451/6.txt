Thanks for your suggestion and patches!
I agree with you that static linking for udeb only.

Yes, the build system is quite old, it's a software wrote 10 years ago.
Really thanks for your patches that overcome the issue.
I just don't like the name "build-deb", which is too close to "build-udeb".
So I change it to "build", with some other cleanups.
My patch is enclosed, and it's based on yours.

Just a nitpicking.
The build cannot be triggered again by "dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us"
after one build.
It was OK in previous version.
However, this is small issue, so I already uploaded.
Cheers,

Subject: [PATCH] d/rules: Cleanup
Now build two versions under the directories below:
 - build: nornal version. The same as previous one.
 - build-udeb: udeb version, which staticly linked with libfl2 (flex
   library)
