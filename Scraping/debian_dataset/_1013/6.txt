I have triggered a l10n-sync run on dillon, to sync the new strings to
the translators material. 
And sadly it did not work as expected: the l10n-sync script apparently does
not assume, that translations are inserted into the po files in the
partman-auto-lvm tree.
Its assumptions are: 
1.
the english phrases are inserted by the package maintainer into the package
tree (in this case partman-auto-lvm tree), and are synced by the l10n-sync
script to the po/sublevelx structure in 
https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/d-i/commits/master
which is the material, translators are working on.
2.
Then the translated phrases are added (from the translators) to the
po/sublevelx structure and are later synced back to the partman-auto-lvm 
tree.
Means we have no translated strings at the moment in GIT :-(
Another glitch is, that one string
---snip-----
#. Type: string
#. Description
#. :sl3:
#: ../partman-auto-lvm.templates:11001
#, no-c-format
msgid ""
"Hint: \"max\" can be used as a shortcut to specify the maximum size, or "
"enter a percentage (e.g. \"20%\") to use that percentage of the maximum size."
msgstr ""
----snap------
is not synced to translators material at all.
Don't know why ATM.
