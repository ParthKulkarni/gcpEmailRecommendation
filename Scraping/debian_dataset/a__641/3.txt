What and how is expected to work based on .buildinfo files in buster?
Usecases based on .buildinfo files uploaded by random people are more
on the fringe side, a more relevant topic is how users can get the 
.buildinfo files from the binaries they are using (or plan to use).
What tool(s) in buster will allow users to download the .buildinfo files 
matching the packages they are using and what is the canonical location 
where such tools will download them from (Debian mirrors or
buildinfo.debian.net)?
If wide adoption of .buildinfo is desired, will providing and 
downloading .buildinfo also seamlessly work for local repositories
in cases where the .buildinfo must not leak to a public place?
Is the sig-repos infrastructure expected to be available for buster,
and how would that interact for example with security updates installed
through unattended-upgrades?
Likely none of the above has an answer right now, and that is OK.
My point is that these are topics that have to be started soon
if it shouldn't be too late for buster.
