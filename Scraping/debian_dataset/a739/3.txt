It would probably be a good idea, sure. I'm only active because of
l10n-targeted uploads. Admitedly, I could also incorporate trivial
patches such as "Patch to support the foobar boards" because it seems
they're usually quite straightforward, but I have no clue when it
comes at these ARM things, so I usually tend to leave it up to someone
else (Karsten or Vagrant) to commit what they think is correct.
Most of the time, when something is committed to GIT, I upload the
package immediately after this, as this is a policy we apply in
debian-boot for quite a while and has proven mostly successful.
As I understand, Vagrant committed your patch so it's quite likely
that I upload a new flash-kernel quite soon.
