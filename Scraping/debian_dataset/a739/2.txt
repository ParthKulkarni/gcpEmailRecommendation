Hello,
I see you've uploaded a new version of flash-kernel, but without
incorporating (or even commenting on) the patches I've previously
provided in these two bug reports.
(I find it quite sad that they where deprioritized given Wandboard is
supposed to be one of the very few officially supported arm boards in
Debian (installer).)
Some feedback would be very welcome, but if there's none I can only
assume you're very busy and will thus proceed to help you out with a
NMU. (Despite these patches being pretty trivial, I'd still prefer to
have your opinion/review of them before upload if possible though.)
Btw, seems like except from Christian Perrier none of the Uploaders
are active. Should I wipe out their names while at it? Maybe some
others would accept being added instead, like Karsten Merker and
possibly also Vagrant Cascadian?
Regards,
Andreas Henriksson
