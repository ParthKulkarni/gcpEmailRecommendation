update-rc.d is now built from init-system-helpers, not sysvinit (because
the same script is used for multiple init systems). This bug was found
and fixed there, not in sysvinit.
sysvinit itself had its most recent maintainer upload in 2015, so it isn't
surprising if nothing has changed in git recently. Patches corresponding
to each subsequent NMU should be available in the BTS.
