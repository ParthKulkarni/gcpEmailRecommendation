It's about sysv-rc, not sysvinit-core; init doesn't matter at all for "init"
scripts -- it's the rc system what does, be it sysv-rc, openrc or
.service-less systemd.  And those indeed have different ways of marking a
particular daemon as enabled or disabled.
This is done by "init-system-helpers" whose job is to record this setting
and set it up even in case a different rc system is installed later, like in
your case.

I've checked what happens for completely independent runs: on stretch, all
is ok, no matter the order.  On current unstable, update-rc.d must be run
only after getting rid of systemd-sysv (not sure if a reboot is needed or
not).
Sounds like this is the culprit:
init-system-helpers (1.50) unstable; urgency=medium
  ...
  * Refactor internals of update-rc.d
    - Refactor actions into a sequence of steps according to the installed
      init systems. This makes plugging new init systems or new actions
      easier.

This would turn on every daemon, even those which have been disabled by the
user.

init-systemd-helpers.
Also, same happens when switching to openrc.  (While I installed quite a few
test systems in the last few days, I switch rc systems before installing
daemons, so I didn't notice this myself.)
Meow!
