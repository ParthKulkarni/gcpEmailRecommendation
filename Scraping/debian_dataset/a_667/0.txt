I used to have a similar setup but eventually migrated to a systemd based setup
with systemd-networkd. With s-networkd, I have an independent bridge, which
serves KVM/Libvirt, User Mode Linux and systemd-nspawn.
VBox, running in bridged mode, used to have a network bug. I am not sure if that
still applies.
