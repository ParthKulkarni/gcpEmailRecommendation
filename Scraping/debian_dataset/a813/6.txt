Last time braille stuff break (brick) a FPGA device with a jtag adaptator (serial to jtag). So i really dislike package that bind to all char device.
Btw if you do this you need a break on braille stuff...
Could we have both ?
A whitelist of well know device ans a package (suggested) lirc-usb that catch all... If you need lirc-usb please film a bug ?
Thanks
