What was the intent of this upload? If it was to try and get the updated 
package into the release, then a) it's (far) too late and b) it should 
have been discussed, not just uploaded to t-p-u.
If, otoh, this was intended for p-u after the release then a) it's far 
too early and b) as above, please follow the usual p-u bug and 
discussion process, don't simply upload.
Regards,
Adam
