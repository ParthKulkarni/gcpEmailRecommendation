Hi,
> Dominik, in your opinion as maintainer, does this bug make xrdp

Well, no. It's not a regression, and having xrdp 0.9.1 in stretch is
really important and a good thing even with this bug.
> It sounds to me that you are unhappy releasing xrdp without this patch.
Nope. This bug is not new and no reason to not release xrdp in stretch.
I would only be happier if it worked for everyone.
But I figure I could handle this as important, so xrdp will not get
removed if the patch doesn't migrate, and still ask for an unblock,
which seems to be also possible for bugs with important severity.
