Hi,
xrdp, a remote desktop server for X.org, has an (upstream) bug that
makes it impossible to use it from clients with high resolutions, like
1920x1080.
This does not affect all users of the package, but seems to be quite a
big deal anyway because when operating a remote desktop server, you
never know what clients will use it.
The patch that upstream has is less than 5 lines.
Should I report and handle this as an RC bug and request unblock in
Debian?
-nik
