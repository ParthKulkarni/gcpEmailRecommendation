Thanks for that. I have just test booting off a USB drive with
the netinst.iso image (written with dd) and it works fine.
This seems like an opportunity to improve the documentation...
When I was looking at the notes on [1] I was unsure how to
get the ISO image onto a USB stick. However that is now covered
in the manual, so perhaps a small pointer would be helpful:
  For extra convenience, these images may also be written directly
  to a USB stick.
+ The <a href="https://d-i.debian.org/manual/en.i386/apa.html";>Installation Howto</a> how to do this.
One other thing might help others avoid the same mistake:
in [2] could something like this be added to the Notes section?
 * The "other images" such as netboot are only useful and safe
   when they exactly match the state of the Debian release they're
   targeting. In almost all cases that will be a _stable_ release.
   In particular, alpha and beta releases of the installer are
   likely to be unusable for more than a few days.
Apologies for the noise
