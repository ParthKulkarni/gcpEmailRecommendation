sorry, I mean the debian-buster-DI-alpha4-amd64-netinst.iso image
that I downloaded from the link above.

It does help and I will try to set up netinst booting/install.
We usually use netboot because it's convenient and works just fine

I tried installing wth the daily installer, built on 20181216-00:11,
using the same hardware. That worked just fine, as one might expect.
Thanks again
