If I see a package which looks unmaintained, is possibly RC buggy and
doesn't look like worth keeping in Debian, I've filed RoAQ RM bugs in
the past myself. I CCed Maintainer/Uploaders asking them to speak up if
they disagree with the RM request (so far, for the RM bugs I've filed,
noone ever replied).
Regards,
Michael
