I've prioritized full vi compatibility except for ex-mode and open mode while
minimizing code size where possible, but I don't think it will be
getting any smaller from now on, just a little larger if I implement
the few remaining discrepancies or go for better POSIX compatibility.

I think you want 2.50.3, as some bugs in the recent changes were found
and fixed in 2.50, .1 and .2. Try moving left on the command line,
inserting some characters into the line and then moving left and right
again and see if the cursor jumps about.
Thanks for bringing xvi to Debian's attention. Did you try "make
check" to see it run the towers of hanoi macros and solve a maze? :)
