We should be respectful of all users, but I don't think fear of causing
offence should be the primary concern.  Otherwise we never would have
moved to systemd.
I feel the concern should be providing a technically valid installation
process for as many users as possible.

If a developer puts his political opinions against the needs of users in
 a particular region, then is it possible that developer is failing to
respect the Debian Social Contract and may not be eligible to be a
developer?
In such cases, it is sometimes possible to identify other developers or
users who adopted a project because they favour the decision too.

I agree Debian should not get into the political side of this debate.
This bug is only for the technical side...

If that means a user in Kosovo is more likely to configure their system
correctly, then it is a good technical solution, similar to what I
described (leaving out the country codes for such regions and helping
them choose alternatives).
We could also have a disclaimer, "Not all entries in this list are
officially recognized as countries, some are disputed territories that
have been included for the purpose of helping users in those regions get
the optimal configuration."
More concise: "Select the entry from this list of regions and countries
that most closely matches your geographic location"

I agree - but producing Free Software means we should feel free to
innovate in this area as long as we are open and honest with our users
about what we are doing and why.
As systemd demonstrated, Debian can't please everybody all the time.
