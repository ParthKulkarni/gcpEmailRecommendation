I have been part of different conference organizations, including of
course DebConf. In more formal ones, they have the figure of the
Conference Chair (the person in charge of logistics) and of the
Standing Committee (year-to-year group of experts that oversee
conference organization and provides it with "prestige").
Of course... It is striking that the Standing Committee does not make
better use of the Chairs!
