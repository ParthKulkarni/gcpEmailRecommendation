No, it only shows we accept software without *name* of the *author*.
We still require *knowledge* of the *copyright holder*.  Preferably 
explicit knowledge - copyright statement copied verbatim from upstream 
source. But alternatively we tolerate some degree of indirect knowledge 
- e.g. an email conversation copied verbatim and accompagnied by a 
statement from the package maintainer of the origin of that email, or a 
statement from the package maintainer that copyright holder is assumed 
to be same as author is assumed to be same as git committer was 
extracted from some external Github URL.
These statements are all different:
 a) "name of copyright holder as used by governments is unknown"
 b) "name of copyright holder is unknown"
 c) "copyright holder is unknown"
 d) "name of author as used by governments is unknown"
 e) "name of author is unknown"
 f) "author is unknown"
a-c is about copyright holder, d-f is about author. a+d is about 
pseudonymity, b+e is about name-less identity (other identifiers than 
name are known). c+f is about anonymity.
If a software project releases a tarball with the file LICENSE.txt in 
the root directory containing the GPL v3, but without any copyright 
statements anywhere, cannot reliably be asumed to be licensed as GPL-3.
Such tarball only says "Here is some code, and those making the tarball 
found it relevant to include a particular license file too".
We prefer someone saying "I am in control, and with that power I grant 
the rights described in that license document over there".
We tolerate a package maintainer saying "I believe $FOO is in control, 
and with that power $FOO grants the rights described in that license 
document over there".
We do not tolerate a package maintainer saying "I believe someone grants 
the rights described in that license document over there".

I interpret "copyright information" to mean either "noone claims to hold 
copyright" or "this or these entities claim to hold copyright".  In 
other words, a (possibly empty) list of copyright holders.
How do you interpret "copyright information" differently?

Software is Free by *use* of some license, not by existence of license. 
Copyright holder need to *grant* said license, so copyright information 
is crucial for license to be relevant to our (re)distribution of code.
