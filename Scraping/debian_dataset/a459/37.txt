The idea is to have them separated, but fully interoperable.
I.e. the proposal ensures such things as:
- foo is not supportable for the buster release cycle. It goes to volatile.
- foo becomes supportable for buster+2.
- foo is backported (as in -backports) to buster+1
This will work properly, among other such scenari.

The whole point is that it is not new work or a new burden. This is one reason for the rules being almost the same and the clear decision path and movement between -backports and -volatile. A -volatile package is handled exactly the same, except it comes from unstable. The workload is the same as if the package had migrated to testing and was being uploaded to -backports. The defined preconditions ensure this is not abused for a ton of packages.
