This is different here. Samba is not in backport because of lack of
time from my side (or other members of the team).
I think that Samba perfectly fits in backport, as the version in
testing is already the latest upstream.

Do you have any stats here? How many download each month? How many
different source IPs? per dist, per samba version?

So, you have 9 repos. How long does it takes to update all those when
a security fix comes?
