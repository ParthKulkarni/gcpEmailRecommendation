It's completely, fully, right. I very much subscribe to all of what
you've quoted from Philipp Kern.

It very much does. Backports are opened when Stable is released, and
closed when Stable is EOL (and there's no backports for LTS, ATM). So
backports are exactly following the lifecycle of a given stable release.
Or do you mean something else here?

And if there's any problem during any of the upgrades, it can be
considered a bug and shall be fixed, by all means! And any upgrades you
may think of. Like stable -> backports, or backports -> testing, or even
from one version of the backport to the next.

Normally, this does not happen. If a package is removed from testing
during the freeze, then it's not re-introduced.
BTW, could you *please* stop calling what you want as "volatile"? Each
time I see it, I think of stable-updates, that's *very* confusing.
