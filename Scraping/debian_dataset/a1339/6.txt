I agree with this reasoning, but I think (if I understand things correctly)
I am still concerned about the idea of this migration stuff being run every
time automatically when you invoke thunderbird (by having it added into the
/usr/bin/thunderbird wrapper directly).
Could the migration stuff be in a separate script, that a user must manually
invoke?
I've seen Firefox occasionally say it needed to perform a migration to cope
with changes in something-or-other when it has updated. Is any chunk of that
logic available to hook into with Thunderbird?
I suppose you could have some prompting logic in the wrapper that would warn
about the presence of the old location and point the user at a separate
migration tool, which could inform the user that they now have two copies of
their profile, pre- and post migration, and to perform cleanup if they are
happy.
We're in freeze now too, and it feels a little worrying to be working on
something this tricky at such a time. As pointed out to me on IRC, though,
it's probably better than post-release, at least.
