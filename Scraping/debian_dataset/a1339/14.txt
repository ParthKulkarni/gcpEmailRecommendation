I found a few residual post-migration mentions of icedove that I 
eradicated manually (found with "grep -lr icedove"):
- absolute paths to IMAP folders in prefs.js were not fixed and still 
referred to $HOME/.icedove: fix was a search and replace; not sure if 
necessary as thunderbird still worked
- mention of icedove in a gcontactsync addressbook: fix was to delete 
and rebuild in gcontactsync
- mention of icedove in panacea.dat and training.dat: removed (spam 
training etc), thunderbird has rebuilt them
I think that was all I found. Everything seems to work, and the removed 
files have been rebuilt.
Kind regards,
