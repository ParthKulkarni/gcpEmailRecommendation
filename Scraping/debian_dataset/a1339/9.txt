there is a reason why we decided to not delete anything here that is
related to the users scope. We don't want delete user files and
configuration as the impact of a deleted folder or files is much bigger
as not used backup of a folder. So we have to go into one direction in
the end.
And I don't see a needed discussion about that small issue as mostly
every singe MP3 file is bigger than the common users profile folder for
Mozilla Thunderbird.
