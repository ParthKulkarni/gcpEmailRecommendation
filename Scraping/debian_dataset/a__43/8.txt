I'm not sure that would make very much sense quite as stated since
Ubuntu's <devel>-proposed â†’ <devel> migration system was explicitly and
consciously [1] a reflection of Debian's unstable â†’ testing system, just
with some more aggressive parameters in terms of time delays and
similar.  The recent changes to reduce delays on testing migration when
autopkgtests pass are IMO moving in the right direction here.
Though if what you mean is something more like single-package tests
before entering unstable (e.g. autopkgtests of the package itself must
pass) and the existing more extensive tests before entering testing, I
can see how that might help.  It would be a fairly significant increase
on cognitive load for maintainers keeping track of everything though.
