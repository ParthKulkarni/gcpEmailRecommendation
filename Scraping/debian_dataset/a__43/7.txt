Well, of course people may disagree about whether the bugs are RC.
That seems to be happening in the case of julia.  In such a situation
having the package in unstable is probably better.  If the conclusion
is that the bugs are not RC, no new upload is needed.
In general, I think it can be sensible to have things in unstable
which are *intended for*, or *wanted in* testing, even if there are
known problems with it that prevent that right now.
And, finally, I don't think really it is ftpmaster's job to REJECT an
upload on the grounds that it should be in experimental rather than
unstable.  Unless it's an overrideable auto-REJECT of course.  As I
say, I'm a fan of those.
Ian.
