is that what debian/source/local-options is about?
The only docs I find about it are:

Then maybe I don't understand or there is at least some confusion about what
pdebuild is doing. At least from James' email I understand that it is trying to
somehow restore the original state (whether it was patches applied or patches
unapplied) by calling:
     $ dpkg-source --before-build .
     $ dpkg-source -b .
     $ dpkg-source --after-build .
It would be great if somebody could clarify all this and maybe help get us to a
state where we can have the involved tools all do the same sensible thing
independent of the source package format and packaging workflow.
Thanks!
cheers, josch
