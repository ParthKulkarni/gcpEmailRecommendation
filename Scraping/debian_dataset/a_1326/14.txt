This would have to be some kind of (perhaps package-specific) personal
configuration, I think.

This is, in the general case, clearly impossible.  As a simple
example, consider the result of the following:
  # .oO{ somepackage is broken }
  dgit clone somepackage && cd somepackage
  # .oO{ hrm I wonder why it is broken - oh there is only one patch }
  # .oO{ oh the breakage is in the busted patch "add zorkmids" }
  git revert -n :/'add zorkmids'
  git commit
Now the tree is exactly identical to a patches-unapplied tree.  But
the user wanted it to drop the patch.  Tools should not reapply it.

All of this applying and unapplying of patches around build operations
is complete madness if you ask me - but I don't see a better approach
given the constraints.  dgit sometimes ends up doing this (and moans
about it), which is even madder given that dgit has git to help it
out.
