Well, just to say, I'm personally quite happy with '3.0 (quilt)'. I try
to maintain all my packages in git in unapplied state, because in my
opinion this is the sensible thing to do. When I do a
  git diff upstream master
I want to see only debian/ in there. I much prefer to check a diff of
diff over a simple diff, because most of the time I want to see what
changed in the packaging, not in the final state. When I want to do the
later, I use debdiff.
For me the patch is the final product, I like the clear separation
between upstream and debian/, so it's for me a very appealing design to
have individual patches in debian/patches. I use git to keep the history
of the patch, not to manage it.
I manage my patches using quilt. I would really prefer if sbuild et al.
would revert the patches after building by default, but that's life. I
respect that other people have other views.
I'm not interested at the moment in dgit or other wrappers because
 1- they seem to me to add complexity to the process;
 2- I prefer to understand what I'm doing.
Kind regards, Thibaut.
