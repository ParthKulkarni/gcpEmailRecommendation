Upstream said that there were many bugs in libfuse, which ultimately
led to fixing them and carrying the library embedded.
https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/issues/431#issuecomment-320512694
From their statement, they may not be interested in root causing issues
in mergerfs with external libfuse. Which effectively may leave Debian
with a buggy version; something I'd not be interested to maintain.
My plan is to let 2.21.0 remain in testing/sid and try newer versions,
only in Experimental. And then see how things progress, both upstream
and downstream.
