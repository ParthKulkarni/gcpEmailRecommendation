The latter. This is why I think that "ILP64" is a misnomer, and should
not be used for labeling the newly introduced libraries.
The ambiguity arises from the fact that some BLAS/LAPACK
implementations are written in Fortran, and use the default integer
type for array indexes. Hence the solution is to compile them with
-fdefault-integer-8. But this does not mean that this code is really
ILP64, because it's not C and hence it does not uses the C ABI. Only
integers exposed through the BLAS/LAPACK ABI are affected (most of them
are array indices, the remaining others are return codes).
For BLAS/LAPACK implementations implemented in C, like OpenBLAS, they
will be compiled using LP64, and not ILP64. Only integers exposed
through the interface will be affected, through the use of appropriate
types.
Best,
