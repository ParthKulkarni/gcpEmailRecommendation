Completely dropping 32-bit-index version of BLAS/LAPACK for 64-bit
architectures is a long way to go. We can keep 32-bit-index version and
64-bit-index version at the same time for a while and see if the
32-bit-version is really droppable.
This reminds me two points about wheter the 32-bit-index version is
droppable. As far as I know, Debian (will) have these BLAS[1] providers:
(1) bin:libblas3  from  src:lapack
(2) bin:libatlas3-base  from  src:atlas
(3) bin:libopenblas-base  from  src:openblas
(4) bin:libblis1  from  src:blis  [WIP]
(5) bin:libmkl-rt  from  src:intel-mkl  [non-free]
(6) bin:libnvblas9.1  from  src:nvidia-cuda-toolkit  [non-free] [2]
* I confirm these providers support 64-bit index in the API.
  (2) (3) (4) (5)
  @Sebastien could you please confirm the status of 64-bit-index support
  in lapack, i.e. (1) ?
* Provider (6) will become a tragedy when Debian no longer provide
  32-bit-index version of BLAS... nvBLAS is a quite special BLAS
  implementation. NVIDIA calls it a "drop in" BLAS library but in fact
  it only implemented several level-3 BLAS routines. When a program
  calls a BLAS function that doesn't exist in nvBLAS, nvBLAS will pass
  the call into another BLAS implementation which is defined in a
  configuration file given by the user.
  
  That means, nvBLAS should call a library which uses index in the same
  width. And nvblas.h suggests that this library only supports 32-bit
  index.

  61 void sgemm_ (const char *transa, const char *transb, const int *m, const int *n, const int *k,
  62              const float *alpha, const float *a, const int *lda, const float *b, const int *ldb,
  63              const float *beta, float *c, const int *ldc);                      
  nvBLAS blocks the removal of 32-bit-index version of BLAS...
