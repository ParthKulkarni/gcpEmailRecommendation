This is perhaps a nice example.  Mind if I ask some questions ?
You say "an option to provide MPI paralellisation".  Is this option
enabled by default ?  Does it occur with all useful functions in the
library ?  Do library callers control over whether it occurs ?
Are there any programs linked against libgyoto which actually call
into libgyoto only some of the time (perhaps, rarely) ?  (I did a
quick search and it seems that libgyoto's rdependency stack is quite
short.  There's some python modules and something to do with yorick,
but they are all explicitly gyoto-related; and there are some blend
metapackages, which are fine.  So maybe the answer to this is no, but
maybe it will become yes in the future.)
Ian.
