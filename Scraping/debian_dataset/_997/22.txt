It does not turn out to be a very good example, I'm afraid. :)

But after checking that list, most of it comes from other -dev
packages and their shared library counterparts. The packages that you
list below are relatively tiny in comparison! Around ~15-20 MiB vs the
total ~280 MiB installed size.

Yes, the problem is that dictionaries such as aspell-en, depend on
aspell, when they should just Recommend/Suggest it, primarily because
this adds an unnecessary dependency cycle, and because the data does
not require the program. Needs a bug filed.

Pulled by libpango-1.0-0. I've checked and it seems currently
unnecessary, nothing in the source calls any Â«fc-*Â» command. It seems
to originate from the very beginning of the pango1.0 packaging source
history in svn, so probably just uncollected cruft. Needs a bug filed.

Pulled by aspell-en â†’ pulled by libenchant. AFAIK used to register
the dictionaries, which seems legitimate to me. (750 KiB)
> emacsen-common ?  Wow.
Pulled by dictionaries-common. Yeah I've always wondered about this
one, perhaps the packaging could be reworked to avoid it, but the
complexity implied might be too great for the few KiB that this
dependency introduces. (135 KiB)

I could probably imagine a tool built during the build making use of it,
or while running test suites or similar. And while this is the biggest
of the non lib/-dev packages, trying to remove this dependeny would seem
wrong to me, as this is an implementation detail.
Perhaps one solution here could be to find a smaller compatible or mock
icon-theme, and depend on it as first option from the gtk -dev package.
But I'm not sure how that would play with apt when having to choose
between the first options in the libgtk-dev and libgtk. :)
In any case this is still inert data, and not huge in comparison to
the total size to be installed.
Thanks,
