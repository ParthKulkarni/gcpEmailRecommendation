Can we just clarify - in the setup that Ian proposed, a "normal" user
would have experience no different to now (except for less bloat);
package maintainers and those using -dev libs are the ones who would
need to read those docs. Package maintainers in order to ensure they
set the correct deps on their packages, and -dev package users to
ensure they are aware of which features of a library need extra
packages installed in order to function.
Cheers,
Nick
