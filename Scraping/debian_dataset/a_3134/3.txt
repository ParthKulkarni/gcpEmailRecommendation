It is true that there has been no activity on #894332 for a few
weeks but I am unsure what you intended to productively achieve by
cross-posting this issue to debian-devel and Reddit.
A quick glance through the wishlist bug in question suggests to me
that the risk/reward of making such a change is unlikely to feature
highly in list of priorities. Drumming up "+1s" elsewhere in the
project is unlikely to alter this nor endear your request to the
aptitude maintainers.
As implied in my original reply, a general discussion regarding a
distribution-wide move to XDG ~/.config directories might be
suitable for -devel, but any further discussion about the aptitude-
specific case should be taken to #894332.
Not only would this prevent the conversation being fragmented
between the three locations, it would also appear to assist in the
"high-volume nature" of this mailing list that you find problematic.
Regards,
