I know this but at least you have the sources in the source package. I was
referring to things like what I did in Kali for metasploit, it's a ruby
application. The .deb ships the metasploit code (available in the source
package) but also all the ruby libraries in a directory created with
"bundle install --vendor" and this includes lots of stuff... plain ruby
code but also binary extensions compiled on other systems and made
available as ready-to-download gems.
Sources:
http://git.kali.org/gitweb/?p=packages/metasploit-framework.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/kali/master
Binary packages:
https://http.kali.org/pool/main/m/metasploit-framework/
