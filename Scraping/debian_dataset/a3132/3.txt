Hi Sotirios,
Ping?
No urgency here, we are far away from any deadline, so there is no need for
a quick translation update.
But it would be fine, if you could sent me a quick note, if you are willing
to take over the translation update job, or not. Even if you say "not before
mid of 2018" or the like, that's fine by me.
However, if you say "no interest, sorry", I would try to recrute other
translators for Greek.
So, what do you think?
Thanks
Holger

Hi Sotirios,
I'm currently trying to get translations updated for our debian-installer for
Buster.
For your language the translation has some work to do, but not that much.
I want to ask if you could take some time to update it?
That would be really great!
Repository is here: https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/d-i/trunk/packages/po/
Translation statistics can be found here: https://d-i.debian.org/l10n-stats/
The relevant files for you are el.po in sublevel2 - 5.
Feel free to ask, if you have any questions!
Thanks
Holger
