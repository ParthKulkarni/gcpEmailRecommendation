Ok, I got your point. I am translator for German, too. 
So I am aware of this general issue. 
However, it's in the hand of the translator to control, what to translate
and what to leave untranslated.
It has often been a point of discussion, what parts to translate and which
not. 
I personally follow the general rule, that I often don't translate 
_technical_terms_. However, then we had discussions like "what is technical" 
and what is not. 
So there is still room for interpretation by translators' feelings :-)
"Bootloader" is left untranslated in German, for example.
Feel free to do changings regarding that.
Holger
