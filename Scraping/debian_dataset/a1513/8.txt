Hi Hilko,
And thanks for your report.

Strange, debootstrap already has this:
|         case $MIRRORS in
|             https://*)
|                 base="$base apt-transport-https ca-certificates"
|                 ;;
|         esac
Please share your installer's syslog?
Anyway, putting debian-cd@ in copy since package lists might need an
update for those two packages, so that they have a high(er) chance of
being available on installation images.
