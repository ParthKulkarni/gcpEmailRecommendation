No, we are not back to square one:
Square one was that we should not need to list copyright holders in 
debian/copyright file at all.
Above I describe how we can list copyright holders in debian/copyright 
file when copyright holder is anonymous, when their name is omitted 
upstream - e.g. like "the anonymous author of files FOO and BAR who is 
assumed to be the copyright holder".

You seem to argue that names of copyright holders are optional because 
they are optional.
What we need is not only license.  From Debian Policy Â§ 12.5:
> Every package must be accompanied by a verbatim copy of its copyright

We also need copyright information.
Reason we need copyright information, is because only a license granted 
by the copyright holders is of use to us.
