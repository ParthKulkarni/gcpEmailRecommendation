This is clearly due to some kind of bug.  The actual installed size is
much bigger.  The "Installed-Size" field is wrong.
I suggest you:
1. Check the bugs against dpkg-dev
2. Try rebuilding it from source and see if that reproduces the bug
3. If so, file a bug against the dpkg-dev package
If rebuilding it produces a correct package with a plausible
Installed-Size, then we need to investigate how the anomalous binary
was generated.
The i386 package has the same problem so perhaps we could find a
.buildinfo to say what the build environment was.
When we know the cause we'll probably want to schedule rebuilds of
affected packages.
