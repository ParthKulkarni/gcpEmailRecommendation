This is the third ITP about 'pw'. The last one has produced a longish
thread on d-d.
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/07/msg00199.html
The information about this new ITP says nothing about the addressed
concerns from the last one. What has been changed since then that would
qualify this ITP to been accepted into the archive?
