Hello Holger,
for "my" projects I have used import.sh from 
https://salsa.debian.org/mehdi/salsa-scripts.git
and never had any problems.
Afaict you have already deleted the repo, so
https://salsa.debian.org/debian/anarchism
Overview -> Details -> [Import repository] 
with https://anonscm.debian.org/git/collab-maint/anarchism.git
should just work now.
cu Andreas
