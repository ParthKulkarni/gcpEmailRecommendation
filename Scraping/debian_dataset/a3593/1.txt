Package: flash-kernel
Severity: wishlist
Dear Maintainer,
Please add support for above mentioned phone.
Since debian armmp kernel 4.9.13-1 the board is reasonably well supported, 
though charging isn't working, which is why I use a custom kernel here.
It comes with a downstream u-boot variant based on 2016.11.
For the sake of simplicity, it is reasonable to expect that there is a 
vendor-provided u-boot binary already installed in nand flash. 
It looks for a boot.scr on any MBR partition on the microSD card
(there is a boot menu available), and executes it if found.
I am pretty sure the current vendor boot-script does not set the expected 
distro_bootpart, and related variables but we can add the necessary pieces 
as they come up!
The rootfs might also be on nand flash, but lets skip that for starters 
because the vendor boot-script could use some improvement in that area.
It currently looks for a kernel uImage and bootm`s that without any initrd.
More details:
There are several iterations of the GTA04, and of its early prototypes.
U-Boot auto-detects at least all those that were shipped to customers, 
and sets fdtfile variable as appropriate. This is the list of DTBs included 
with linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp:
/usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp/omap3-gta04a3.dtb
/usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp/omap3-gta04a4.dtb
/usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp/omap3-gta04a5.dtb
If you need any further details, let me know!
Yours sincerely
Josua Mayer
