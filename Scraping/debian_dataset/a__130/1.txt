For the case of locally built binaries, bringing any problem
that usrmerge would hit to the light would be preferable.
eg. Consider the case of:
cat << EOF > /usr/local/bin/grep
#!/bin/sh
grep --color $@
EOF
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/grep
(Or export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH and something similar as above.)
I've certainly in my maintainer history had people demand fixes
for problems that where caused by their local build environment
setup containing alot crazier things than the above.

PS. As previously mentioned reproducible builds has already been set up
to help catch issues so I don't understand the urgency, see:
https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/issues/unstable/paths_vary_due_to_usrmerge_issue.html
Better ask release-team for permission to treat these as RC if you feel
strongly about these issues.
