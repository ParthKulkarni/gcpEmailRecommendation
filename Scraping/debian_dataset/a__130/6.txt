Control: reassign -1 tech-ctte
Dear Technical Committee.  I don't know if you are all aware of the
discussion surrounding this, so I will recap:
Recently debootstrap was changed to do merged-/usr by default, so that
/bin -> /usr/bin etc.
It was discovered that when this change took effect on the Debian
buildds, the buildds started to build packages which do not work on
non-merged-/usr systems.
This is a special case of a general problem: buster systems with
merged-/usr sometimes build packages which are broken on
non-merged-/usr systems.
Some people have suggested that this should be fixed by making
merged-/usr mandatory for buster.  However, there is no transition
plan for this as yet and I don't think Debian is ready to commit to do
that.
So I believe that this change should be immediately reverted in sid
and buster, so that we do not prejudge the situation by increasing the
number of buster installs in the field which generate packages which
are broken on non-merged-/usr systemss.
I filed this bug against debootstrap but its maintainers do not agree:

Obviously I disagree.  I think the question is urgent.  Please would
you rapidly overrule the debootstrap maintainers.
After we have ceased introducing new lossage we can have a proper
conversation about what the plan ought to be for buster and bullseye.
Ian.
