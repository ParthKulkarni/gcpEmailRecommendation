Thanks for this report, Ansgar. This clearly sums up the issue. I am
amazed the whole archive managed to be rebuilt on such a short time!
I guess the next step is to file the multiple bugs pending to be

...And I guess this points towards the Technical Committee not having
to intervene in the issue. Which is, IMO, the best possible outcome.
Thanks to everybody following through with this!
