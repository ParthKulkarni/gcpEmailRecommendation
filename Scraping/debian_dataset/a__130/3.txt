This is not a solution. For a start it would take many years.
Even ignoring that, it would not bring any improvement over the current 
plan: even if your idea were executed perfectly and quickly then the 
conversion program would still be in the same exact situation as it is 
now: either everything in /bin/, /sbin and /lib (and its own 
subdirectories) was created by the packaging system, and then we already 
know that it can be converted automatically, or it was not, and then we 
know that there are a few cases when the local administrator has to 
decide what to do about things that were installed by himself in the 
past in the wrong place.
So this would make the transition unacceptably slow while providing no 
benefit at all, but it would also cost a huge amount of work to change 
many packages.
