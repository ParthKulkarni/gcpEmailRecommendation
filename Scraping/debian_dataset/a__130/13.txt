The Reproducible Builds project was so kind to help and now runs one
build in a non-merged-/usr and a second build in a merged-/usr
environment.  Packages that hardcode the path to utilities, but would
pick up the wrong one in a merged-/usr environment will result in a
difference between the two builds and can thus be found.
See [1] for an overview of issues found this way; as the entire archive
was already rebuilt in this setup, there shouldn't be many more issues
of this type that we don't know about[2].
Not all of these differences even cause issues as in a few packages the
utility with the hardcoded path is not even used at all.
Bug reports were already submitted for over half the packages, often
including a simple patch (usually something like adding BASH=/bin/bash
to dh_auto_configure).
So we look to be on a good track to address the remaining issues.
I don't think that the debootstrap default has to be reverted
temporarily again to deal with this: there are only very few packages
causing problems and these should have a patch soon.
In addition one has to actually built one of the very few packages in a
merged-/usr environment and then install them in a non-merged-/usr
environment to actually trigger the problem and debootstrap already
defaults to non-merged-usr for buildd chroots for now.
