The best thing is probably to make yourself a guest account at
https://salsa.debian.org/ and host your packaging repository
there. Both the Go team (https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/) and
the XMPP team (https://salsa.debian.org/xmpp-team/) use Salsa.
I wonder, why you want to package go-sendxmpp, if sendxmpp does
the same? Just another implementation language does not sound
like a great reason to have a new package. Maybe you can point
out some advantages, e.g. in functionality, performance, memory
consumption, dependency burden, security?
