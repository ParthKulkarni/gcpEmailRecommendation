I didn't go this way. I actually tried to add the relevant keys to
~/apt/trusted.gpg.d but that doesn't help that much : 
"apt-get $APT_OPT update " still gives these error messages
I did so by manually getting the keys and exporting them in
/apt/trusted.gpg.d/{jessie|wheezy}.gpg : using apt-key doesn't work as
it insists on being run as root.
The script can work if one adds "--allow-unauthenticated" to APT_OPT
in config/gen-stats.conf. Error messages during "apt-get update" are
still there, but at least testing packages can be downloaded (there
are a few errors for some packages but I suspect that this is because
these are no longer in testing).
I'd rather make this work than using chdist as, as far as I've seen,
that seems to be a quit einvasive change.
