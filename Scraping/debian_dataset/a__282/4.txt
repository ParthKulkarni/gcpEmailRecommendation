Thanks, that looks good to me.

doc/installation-guide is a bit lengthy but grouping everything under
doc/ would make sense. Regarding the old URL, having a redirection
from manual to there would only cost a few lines of index.html?
If we agree for doc/, having doc/internals would look good too I
suppose?
