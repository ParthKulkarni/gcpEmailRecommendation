Definitely! I haven't managed to solve that in yearsâ€¦

Incremental looks good to me, this should heavily decrease time spent
there on dillon. The only downside I can think of is that we might only
discover issues when performing the installation-guide upload in case
there are corner cases that incremental builds wouldn't have helped
uncover.
I'm not sure such corner cases are particularly likely, so I'd go for
incremental without second thoughts. If issues do pop up, we can adjust.
Thanks for taking care of the documentation, that's really appreciated.
(I've seen all bug mails lately, that's impressive.)
Cheers,
