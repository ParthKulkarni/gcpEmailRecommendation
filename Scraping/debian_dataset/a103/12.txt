Well, I can simply point at what we said last time (IIRC) the question
was raised, here are the importants point we see in being on debian
instead of debian-ports:

This has been changed since then: debian-ports architectures show up
there.

I believe this is also now done for debian-ports architectures? This
really saves a lot of duplicate work for porters.

I don't know if we have this for debian-ports?

As said at the time, this is rather already the case.

Considering how even quite a few Linux architectures ports are not
making it, I don't think we could say it likely that hurd-i386 be part
of a stable release.

Concerning mirroring, it is indeed useless to mirror hurd-i386
worldwide. Considering maintenance burden, I'm a bit afraid of here
simply moving the load from the ftpmaster team to the debian-ports
ftpmaster team. I don't know the details, so can't say, I'm just Cc-ing
both teams.

Such statistics are really difficult to get any real conclusion from.
Sometimes 10% packages are missing just for one tricky nonLinux-specific
issue in one package.
