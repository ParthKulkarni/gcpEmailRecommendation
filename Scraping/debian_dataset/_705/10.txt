I am not asking for a valid signature. It could but also just an
additional header field or something. It does not happen very ofter but
it gets more annoying each time it happens.
In the end it is just the submitter and/or the maintainer that should
close the bug so most people probably won't notice this.

Maybe it would help if we could get rid of the old "close+reopen" bugs
from the bug's page. All bugs in which I observe those "spam-close
mails" were closed earlier (by mistake or wrong reasons) and then
reopened. If they are still harvesting then it would help. If they keep
their database then it probably makes no sense.
