Package: installation-guide
Severity: wishlist
On (for example)
http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.arm64/index.html
the installation guide has warning messages like
"Although this installation guide for amd64 is mostly up-to-date, 
we plan to make some changes and reorganize parts of the manual 
after the official release of buster."
or
"This installation guide is based on an earlier manual written for the 
old Debian installation system (the “boot-floppies”), and has been updated 
to document the new Debian installer. However, for arm64, the manual has 
not been fully updated and fact checked for the new installer. There may 
remain parts of the manual that are incomplete or outdated or that still 
document the boot-floppies installer."
depending on the architecture.
Those warnings are there since Woody or Sarge, and I think they are no
longer true.
We should remove them.
Comments welcome.
