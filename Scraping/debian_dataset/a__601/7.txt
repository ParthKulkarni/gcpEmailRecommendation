Joy. :-(
There are other hacky ways of trying this out - try "type ls" to see
if type works, then fall back to which, etc. Or actually try running
the extractor command (xzcat /dev/null), and check for the return
code.
But those are all hacky solutions. Maybe better to just detect posh
and bail with a message "get a real shell", then...
