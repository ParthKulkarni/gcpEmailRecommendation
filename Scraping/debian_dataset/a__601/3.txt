This wouldn't work, since /dev/null is not in xz format. ;-)
Fortunately there is a better solution: Joey Hess has already put an
in_path() function (basically a stripped-down version of debianutils'
which command) that can be used instead.  See the attached patch which
worked for me (I did not dare to symlink posh to /bin/sh, but rather
changed the shebang in /usr/sbin/debootstrap to test it).
Cheers,

Subject: [PATCH] Avoid the 'type' shell command
It is not mandatory in POSIX and tus not implemented by posh.  Use the
in_path function instead which is taylored for this need.
