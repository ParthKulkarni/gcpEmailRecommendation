piuparts has support for using chroots:
    -e dirname, --existing-chroot=dirname
        Use the specified directory as source for the new chroot,
        instead of building a new one with debootstrap. This is
        similar to --basetgz, but the contents are not archived. See
        also the --hard-link option.
I haven't tried it with schroot's chroots yet but it works with
cowbuilder's chroots for me.
Cheers,
gregor
