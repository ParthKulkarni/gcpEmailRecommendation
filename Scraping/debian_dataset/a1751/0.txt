Tainted is a loaded term that may make this more confusing.  I think it
may be better to instead think of it as additional metadata to figure out
why a package is buggy, if a bug shows up.  Some build states we know are
more likely to cause problems than others, but if a bug exists only in the
versions of the package built in a minimal chroot and not in the versions
built on a regular system, that's a useful clue to what may be causing
problems.
But perhaps the reproducible build testing infrastructure is the better
solution to this problem.
