Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
Hi,
We're entering the deep freeze in a few hours, and this mail should have
been sent a while ago, but let's not delay this any further: the Debian
Installer team requests assistance with maintaining the busybox package.
[ So please make sure to include debian-boot@lists.debian.org in copy
if you're replying to this message. ]
The description of the main package is the following:
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
 single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the
 most common utilities you would usually find on your desktop system
 (i.e., ls, cp, mv, mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox
 generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins;
 however, the options that are included provide the expected
 functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install symlinks
 for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities can be used
 in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd, busybox-udhcpc or
 busybox-udhcpd packages.
The full list of binaries is as follows:
 - busybox
 - busybox-static
 - busybox-udeb
 - busybox-syslogd
 - udhcpc
 - udhcpd
The busybox-udeb package is one of the basic building blocks of the
Debian Installer, which means that busybox maintenance includes making
sure any regressions spotted there can be fixed in a timely manner.
KiBi.
