Hello Ian,
I understand your frustration with the work shared with the author and
other linked people. However, this is not the way to answer to
somebody who is attempting to do a contribution to understand the
social weather after an important change.
The first part of your mail is... Maybe somewhat harsh (I would invite
you to review the "ignoring negativity" panels at this last DebConf;
that's not the communication pattern our project needs!), but this
last paragraph is frankly... Frightening.

So, maybe Asavaseri is a student struggling with methodology? Maybe a
researcher from a different field, who can use some correction in his
ways for this subject? For that, we would all thank you for most of
your mail.
But with this paragraph, your mail turned into a _threat_. That is not
something that should go down easily. I ask you not to pursue this
path.
