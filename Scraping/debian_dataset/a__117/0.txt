Debian policy has a clear statement on the validity of the address in
the Maintainer: field. I fully support this "must" requirement, that's
why I'm doing this cleanup job - and not because I'm a huge fan of
beaurocratic processes.
On the other hand I fully agree doing dozens or hundreds of uploads just
because an address out of my control became invalid is a huge waste of
ressources that are better spent elsewhere. However, that's why
alioth-lists was created.
So I see two options: Either get wide consensus packages like yours are
not considered rc-buggy for the time being, also make sure it's assured
important mails like bug reports do reach people who are in charge of
the respective package.
However, keep in mind I would certainly not agree to that since it's a
terrible hack, creates a precedent I wouldn't want to see, and mostly:
There's another option, ask the alioth-list administrators to create an
according forward. For you, this should take less time than writing an
answer to this message, for them hopefully not much longer.

Noted. But anybody could do this as well.
