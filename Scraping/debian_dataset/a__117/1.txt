Seconded.
A few questions, though (asking for a friend, of course). It might have
been mentioned before but I have missed it then.
What is the long-term plan for this service? Indefinitely, or are users
kindly asked to move away from these addresses when convenient? In the
latter case lintian should emit according hints since even then this
might take several years.
Also, @lists.alioth.debian.org addresses that were *not* migrated now
result in bounces as expected. Are there already plans for a MBF
severity RC against all packages with a now-failing maintainer address?
This might become rather messy, I've counted some 1450 packages.
