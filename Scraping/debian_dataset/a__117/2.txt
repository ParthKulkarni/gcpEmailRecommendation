Hi Carsten,

AFAICR it's always been admin@. In fact, I don't remember any
mention of mailman@. Where did you find that mailman address?
Maybe you missed the last announcement on d-d-annouce on this
topic:

Sorry, probably the mailman address is not being attended.

The https://alioth-lists.debian.net/ lists several means of
contact with the team (salsa issues, email and irc). I'd suggest
salsa issues to better keep track of such requests.
There's no explicit information about requesting late migrations
but people can request them as long as alioth is alive, which
won't be for much longer.
Cheers,
Alex
