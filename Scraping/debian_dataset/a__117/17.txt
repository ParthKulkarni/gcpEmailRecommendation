A lot of other teams are in this situation.  And no one seems to know what
are we supposed to do.  So the results are quite... random.
For example, on my packages:
4 have Debian Fonts Task Force <pkg-fonts-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>
1 has Debian Desktop Theme Team <darkcold-gtk-theme@packages.debian.org>
2 (in NEW) have debian-fonts@lists.debian.org
The first four are traditional, and just became buggy as that list has been
migrated to l.d.o rather than not-yet-then-announced alioth-lists (which is,
as I understand, only a temporary measure).  I need to fix those.
The next one, has only the human name matching, with some crap as e-mail. 
Most tools match by the latter, thus this scheme doesn't seem to work.  I'll
change it as soon as anyone tells me _what_ to switch to.
The last two have a good working maintainer address, but violate the rules
for l.d.o lists (as you say, these shouldn't get maintainership mails).

This is not done automatically, thus in a good part of cases will be
forgotten.
Meow!
