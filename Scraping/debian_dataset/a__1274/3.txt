About the doing the init on a future boot, yes you are wrong.

2.6.37 apparently.

I believe it is on by default.  However, the lazy init takes
place in the background on first mount (so that means during
the install), not some later boot.  It apparently will use
up to 16MB/s for initializing in the background according to
https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Ext4_Filesystem
I suspect it is already doing the best you are going to get.
