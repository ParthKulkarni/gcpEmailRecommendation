Well they wanted to keep the rate low enough that you could still use the
disk while it was doing the background init work.  Most disks can do more
than 16MB/s so that leaves some for other use, like doing your install.

Well it would have to do the whole init up front, meaning you have to
wait for all of it to finish before doing the install.

Not sure.  It has been a while since I poked at the installer code.
I don't think it's worth trying to poke at it.  I think the default
behavour sounce very sensible and I doubt for most use cases doing it
differently would be an improvement, most like it would make it worse.
