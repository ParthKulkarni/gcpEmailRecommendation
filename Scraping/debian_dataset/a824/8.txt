Mind you, all the software contained in main and contrib's packages is
free software. The question is into which of main and contrib the
software under discussion should go.
Actually, I haven't seen anyone citing the following part of policy
2.2.1: "None of the packages in the main archive area require software
outside of that area to function."
If we agree that "functioning software" does more than print an error or
a usage note, this part makes it rather clear where free client software
to non-free server software belongs.
In another message Tollef writes about a software's or service's
usefulness. That's orthogonal to classification into main, contrib and
non-free.
