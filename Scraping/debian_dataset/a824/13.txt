The value of an ICQ server with a singular user is pretty low.  The
value there lies not in the software itself, but the network effects and
the people you can talk to.
Likewise, a lot of the value in using various cloud services is not in
the software implementations. It's in how they are run, that there's
Â«alwaysÂ» capacity available and so on.
I think this is important, because those are attributes that can't be
packaged.  Having the source (and redistribution rights) to some cloud
provider's software would not really put us that much closer to having
what they offer and make them attractive.
