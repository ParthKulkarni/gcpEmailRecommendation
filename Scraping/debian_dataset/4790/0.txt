Thanks for taking care of it. However, I tried again and that still doesn't 
work:

There was an error processing this section. No changes were committed.
Details:
Key 7E7729476D87D6F11D91ACCBC293E7B461825ACE is not in DM keyring.
My target is pretty simple: to remove my name "Boyuan Yang" and all related 
"Allow" information from https://ftp-master.debian.org/dm.txt since that is no 
longer necessary. With my key moved out from DM keyring into DD keyring, that 
seems not possible currently.
