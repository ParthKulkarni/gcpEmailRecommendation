That's where protected branches come to the rescue: you can
protect the master branch so people have to send a merge
request. Usually the rules don't apply to debian group because
all DD are maintainers in the group and maintainers can write
to master. But the repo settings can be set so nobody can write.
OTOH, protected branches may be a burden for maintainers making
mass commits to fix URLs, etc.
Ah, and make sure you're watching the project if you want to
receive notifications.
Cheers,
Alex
