Unsure, if this is an acceptable solution:
- since filing such bugreports is a manual step 
- and most Debian volunteers are short on time
this is most likely to not happen very often IMO.
At least there is still a high chance for that merge requests, to rott on 
Salsa for a long time.
Also, that would lead to two different places, where discussions on the
topic might be running, with different audience, which are not aware of
the other site.
And: for small things, that might be not worth a bugreport, one could think
that a merge request at salsa is a suitable way, but if package maintainers
are not aware of it, ...
In summary, this sounds like a semi-optimal solution to me.
