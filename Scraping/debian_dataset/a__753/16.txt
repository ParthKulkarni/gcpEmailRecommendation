Hello,
alioth's collab-maint was a zero-admin way to have a Debian hosted GIT
repository, without implying a specific commit-policy. e.g.:
| If a maintainer wants to maintain his/her package within a VCS, (s)he
| can use the collab-maint repository even if the package is not (yet)
| collaboratively maintained. This is always useful since contributors
| are more likely to propose patch if they can be sure that the work has
| not yet been done.
i.e. e.g. for this use case patch-submitting instead of direct
committing was expected.
And this was the way it was used, although DD had commit-rights, they
would not do uncoordinated commits to master. There was no technical
barrier but a social one. Similar to package uploading. Technically
every DD has upload rights for everything, but we have a common ground
what is accepted there. The technical barriers are the same on salsa
as they were on alioth, the implicit barriers obviously have changed,
probably because forking and merge request for private projects is
easy now.

I have updated the wiki, I am little bit more awake than yesterday.
