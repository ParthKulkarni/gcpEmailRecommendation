I disagree when it comes to the debian namespace, and the documentation 
agrees with me[1].
I agree that one should exercise judgement: I wouldn't commit an 
intrusive patch without discussing first. But there are many changes that 
do not need discussion. But for example, about a month ago Ond≈ôej Nov√Ω 
changed the Format: url of d/copyright to use https on one of my packages 
(and I assume a lot more), and didn't notify me. I don't think it is 
reasonable to ask for coordination for this type of changes, and I would 
agree that even notifying is too much effort if this was done salsa-wide. 
Some fixes are better just done than talked about :).
BTW, thanks Ond≈ôej Nov√Ω for those "editorial" fixes!
Additionally, if one is doing an NMU, I think that should be pushed to 
salsa if the permissions allow it.
