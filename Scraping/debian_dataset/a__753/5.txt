If you would go for the solution I described, you'd enable a webhook
in settings > integration of your project (you'd first need to write
such integration and serve it somewhere as an endpoint).
Note that this would only be if you need to send to a specific team.
If it's for individual emails, you really should go with the built-in
"watch" on the repository as described earlier in the thread.
