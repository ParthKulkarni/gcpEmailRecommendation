I wonder if we should have a custom integration enabled like we do for
setting the tags pending. It would send an email to the maintainer
when a MR or an issue would be created.
I don't expect Salsa to be aware of the Maintainer and Uploader fields
of a package, so a custom integration would make sense to me.
This change could be scripted globally and also added to the
salsa-scripts for when you create a repo.
Does that sound like a reasonable solution?
