Yes.  I think it will have to be enabled by default.
If people don't like the emails it generates, this should be "fixed"
by disabling MRs rather than by disabling the email bridge.
Do you know how to write such a thing ?  Where would it be
configured ?  (Eg, what if I want to add a configurable feature to
automatically turn an MR into a series of patchbomb emails rather than
one email?)
