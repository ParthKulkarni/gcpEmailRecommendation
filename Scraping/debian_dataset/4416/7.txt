Here's my attempt at rewording your rewording:
<para> You will have to use your judgement as to whether a given
combination factors constitutes neglect; in case the maintainer
disagrees they have only to say so (see below).  If you're not sure
about your judgement or simply want to be on the safe side, there is a
more precise (and conservative) set of conditions in the <ulink
url="&wiki-salvaging-packages;"> wiki</ulink>. These conditions
represent a current Debian concensus on salvaging criteria. In any case
you should explain your reasons for thinking the package is neglected
when you file an Intent to Salvage bug later.
</para>
I thought the changed wiki wording was ok (and easier to change anyway).
