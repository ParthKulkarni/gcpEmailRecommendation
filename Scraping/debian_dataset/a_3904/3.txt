AIUI the point of splitting it would be to allow people to avoid the
udev rule.  It is often a good idea to separate packages containing
quiescent utilities from packages containing automatical-launching

Presumably that's OK because the previous udftools package did this
automatic stuff too, only a different way.
FTR I don't have an objection to dropping the init script in favour of
a udev rule.
