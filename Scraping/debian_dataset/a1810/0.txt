Then don't disable Recommends in apt preferences.

I agree with Adam here.  The problem is that it is not just a small
number of packages that inflate dependencies.  It only takes a few
inflated dependencies here and a few there to result in significant
bloat.
And to be clear, this thread is not about the difference between
Suggests and Recommends.  Both of those cases allow the admin to choose
not to install the dependent package.  It is about the difference
between Recommends and Depends.  Once this line is crossed, you have
taken away the sysadmin's ability to choose.
