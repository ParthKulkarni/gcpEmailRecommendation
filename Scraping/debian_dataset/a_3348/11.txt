I agree with you, it is the best outcome. But when people with power (-backports ftp masters) are not willing to consider it, we have to go with plan B, which is less than ideal, but can move things forward.

If people argue both ways, how can we answer? Either it adds more work for -backports team or it does not. Some people say its not fair to add more load while ftp masters say its not about load.
If it does not add extra load, then I don't see why it can be kept out of -backports when it qualifies except for being a dependency of -volatile. They say it does not match with their vision. So what option is left for us? We have to take their word for it and move forward without inconveniencing them. I don't think -backports ftp masters is going to accept this proposal (from the responses we already received), so I can live with all dependencies in -volatile.
