It has a few points of intersection:
 - Should the package begin to migrate to testing again, it must
   be moved to stable-backports.
 - Using the same ~bpo version namespace
 - "treat it as part of backports", which I assume means that
   backports users would automatically consume this repo
 - new binary uploads to volatile have to undergo the
   same NEW queue as backports
I don't think these are deep, inherent things (it's possible to
preserve the spirit of the proposal while removing them), but please
don't accuse me of pulling them out of thin air.

Thanks.  That points to who you may want to get help from:
 - DSA, for hosting
 - ftpmasters, in case you'd share their DAK instance
 - porters, to find out what level of port + buildd support they want
   to maintain

That's fine.  There's no time like the present to learn!

I think you're underestimating the impact on other teams.  That's
fine: it's probably worth it, but you will need to get buy in.

backports maintainers, debian-ports maintainers, and others may have
experience with this.  I don't know the best place to get advice from
them --- you may already be in the right place. :)
