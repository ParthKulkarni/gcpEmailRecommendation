So ask someone who does and who would care about this proposed new
suite? Alternatively, ask for a VM on debian.org infrastructure?
Personally I don't know whether you'll get that, but IMHO this seems
like something that could use debian.org infrastructure, even if it
should use a debian.net domain for the time being.

I'm sure that if you ask nicely, ftpmaster people would be happy to help
you out in setting up things, if you get stuck. After all, they did that
for backports initially, too, if I'm not mistaken...

Nothing you can see right now, perhaps. However, since your proposed
ruleset is different from that of -backports as well as that of the
official debian.org infrastructure, I can imagine that you might want to
change the setup a few times when you're still experimenting with the
whole thing. Doing that on the same infrastructure as the official
Debian archive network carries with it a significant risk to the proper
operation of the base Debian distribution (imagine you ask DSA to please
make a destructive change to your suite and they accidentally make it to
more than just your suite...). I'm sure you don't want that. Even
ignoring that, having your own infrastructure allows you to easily
experiment with things, without having to ask someone with the necessary
root login to make the changes that you need.
For that reason, it seems entirely reasonable to request that, at least
initially, new suites are installed on separate infrastructure from the
official debian.org infrastructure.
