My recommendation would be for nothing to be recommended. Changing it on
a year by year is hardly inspiring. Debian should not be *recommending*
software it has no control over; especially in the Manual. The CD FAQ
seems geared up for promoting guidance for other OSs.  Why not use that?
(Some of the issues raised in the OP are probably a load of nonsense so,
on the basis the devil you know is better than the one you don't, stick
with win32diskmanager if it highly desirable to promote utilities of
this nature within official documentation).
