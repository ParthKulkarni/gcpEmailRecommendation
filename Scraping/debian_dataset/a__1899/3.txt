So, now we recommend two tools Debian does not control in the
Installation Guide. When another post like Varanka Risto's
(quoted above) comes along, do we look for a third one? Then a
fourth?
Mentioning such software in a core document implies we support
it. (Your response is actually a gesture of support for a non-
working Debian recommendation).
> +There are also utilities for other operating systems to copy the image.
is factual and covers the situation. Why not go with that? It
is neutral and does not commit us to anything, unlike adding
a second suggestion.
Specifics can be dealt with at https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/
or in the wiki. The Installation Guide is not the place for
promoting non-Debian utilities.
