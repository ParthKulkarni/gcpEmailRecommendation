That should not be necessary.  If we really needed that information
(which seems unlikely to me), buildinfo files can provide it.  Otherwise
we'd set built-using to "everything in the build chroot" for every
single package, and that doesn't seem like something we want or need to
do.  browserify doesn't seem to be that special, IMO.
