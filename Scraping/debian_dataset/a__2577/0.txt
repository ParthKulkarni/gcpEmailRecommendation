Hi guys,
Wondering if anybody here succeeded to configure your debian email in
the "Send mail as" configuration in gmail (for the gmail users). If so
do you have tips on how you didi it?
My main problem seems to be that gmail forces the authentication and
master.debian.org doesn't allow it. It returns: "Unspecified Error
(SENT_SECOND_EHLO): Smtp server does not advertise AUTH capability,
code: 0"
I've also tried to send emails after configuring thunderbird but
encountered some issues as well. Seems master.debian.org doesn't allow
to send to non debian.org address, its that correct?
Thanks for your help,
Joseph
