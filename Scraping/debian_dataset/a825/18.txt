As for limiting / truncating Debian changelogs, there is an existing 
implementation that we may refer to, which is Ubuntu's approach: they keep 
certain amount of changelog in the .deb package (I'm not sure about the 
detailed algorithm but that is available somewhere) while adding some 
explanation words at the bottom providing a URL that can access full changelog 
online.
If Debian wants to limit changelog size as well, it may be better if we keep 
similar / identical behaviour / implementation as Ubuntu.
