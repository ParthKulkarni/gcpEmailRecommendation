No.

If this would be "just" extending the current LTS ways for more time,
then it would be OKish to stay on donated, voluntarily managed,
infrastructure. After all it helps all users of wheezy with updates,
nominally over all of wheezy.
But the proposal is effectively just for a benefit of a few paying
customers, with a very selected set of packages and architectures, all
the rest lost out. Thats not ok to ask volunteers to support, nor
is it ok to use projects infrastructure for. The companies that want it,
should run it.
