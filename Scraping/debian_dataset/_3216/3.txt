Dear all,
There are two three queries I have but instead of bunching them
together, would try to get solutions or pointers by spelling them
individually.
Below is the first one -
1. Installation report on installation failure - At times when you are
installing Debian either on too new hardware or too old, obsolete
hardware, at times the installation fails invariably/probably due to a
driver issue.
The device I usually use to do are usb disk/s / thumbdrive  as I find them to be
more convenient as well as having better shelf-life than most cheap
DVD's. Some good usb disks have lasted even four years and beyond as
well.
When the installation is a success, I know I could just run reportbug
and put 'installation report' as the package and it would tell/share
that the installation was a success.
My query is how to save installation report and send it in the
instance when the installation is a failure. I know that details of
what worked or didn't is in the memory (RAM) but how to save it to usb
disk/usb thumbdrive ? At times where I'm installing I do not have
immediate access to the web to send it.
Another use-case is to get the same data to study and see if I could
figure out possible issue and resolve it locally and then send  the
same to the Debian BTS.
I had read somewhere that one way to do it is if I have say an 8 or 16
GiB usb disk/hdd I could partition it, put the iso image on one
partition and save the report on another partition . But how to do
that remains a mystery ? There also may be other ways in which the
installation report could be sent but how could that be done I'm
unsure.
I just saw https://bugs.debian.org/861123 but it's not immediately
apparent whether he saved the report locally or not.
Looking forward for pointers and strategy.
