This has been proposed previously, but because we don't get that many
spam runs against -done which make it through our filters and this would
make legitimate interactions with the BTS more difficult, I don't plan
on implementing it.
I have some ideas about using mail/web roundtrip for first time mails to
the BTS, but they're pretty far down my debbugs TODO list.
