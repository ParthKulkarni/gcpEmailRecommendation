debian-installer-netboot-images does a similar thing, but it's more of a shell 
re-implementation of a trust chain check:
http://sources.debian.net/src/debian-installer-netboot-images/
20170615%2Bdeb9u1/get-images.sh/
(Patches welcome, of course)
The reason for that (and #807168 documents this) is that:
* d-i-n-i binary packages are arch:all packages with arch-specific content; 
because we want to ship any arch's netboot images on all architectures; and 
forcing the use of multiarch for that is overkill.
* building these arch:all packages in an arch:any build (such as d-i's) is not 
supported and would be a heavy arm-twisting of our buildd infrastructure.
tl;dr; It's certainly no good, but it's the best we have.

Well. #807312 tracks a way to eventually do the above in a policy-compliant 
way: build arch:any packages containing netboot images and build d-i-n-i using 
multiarch Build-Depends.
As for changing Policy; what matters is that we ultimately build things from 
known and DFSG-free _sources_, in a reproducible way. dpkg, apt and sbuilds 
are just (_FANTASTIC_) means to that end. So we either need better tooling 
than the above hideous shell, or massage everything into existing tooling. I 
prefer the "there's a RC bug to fix" situation over a "weaker policy", for now.
