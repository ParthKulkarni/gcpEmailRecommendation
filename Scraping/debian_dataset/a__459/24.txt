The testing distribution and this concept contradict each other. The
testing distribution is the least supported stage in the Debian release
cycle, and if used, shall only be used for testing the next Debian
release. Especially, there are no timely security updates in testing,
neither by the security nor by the maintainer. So using it for anything
other than testing the next Debian release in a laboratory is a bad
idea.
This proposal, however, is about providing fast-paced software as an
exception on an otherwise stable system.
So if anyone wants to test fast-paced software within a Debian testing
system, they should use the package from unstable, yes. (Having testing
on a system without the sid zources is close to impossible outside the
freeze anyway.)

That certainly is something maintainers need to care about. (I consider
a software not supporting skipping versions on upgrade a bug, anyway.)
But most importantly, this is nothing that is specific to the -volatile
proposal - it is the same for regular backports. So discussing this
general backporting issue should not be mixed with the discussion of
this proposal.
