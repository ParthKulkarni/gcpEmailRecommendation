As long as the package is in -volatile, it is not in stable+1, and
upgrades are ensured by the volatile maintainer. If the package is to go
into stable+1 again, ist must move to -backports (see original proposal
for details on that).

I think oldstable-volatile could keep rolling if the maintainer wishes
to do so, but must never be newer than stable-volatile, of course.
Upgrades between oldstable-volatile and stable-volatile must be ensured
by the maintainer.

Maybe that's why we are drafting a mechanism to support them outside the
stable release distribution ;).
