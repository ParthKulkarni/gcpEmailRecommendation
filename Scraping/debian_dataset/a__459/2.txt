Well, I have read, and taken into account all of the thread. However, I
feel like what you need is the Debian Bikesheds repositories (note:
absolutely *not* the Ubuntu-PPA-like, but rather, Ganneff proposal).
How about contributing to Dak so that we get the Bikesheds creation API
that is still lacking?
Cheers,
