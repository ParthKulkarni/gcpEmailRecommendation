So what would a user of testing do? Will there be a

install unstable with no other pre-release staging ground? (Which seems 
like a bad idea.)
Similarly what are the constraints you set for upgrading, if any? How 
far back will upgrades work and how current do users need to keep their 
system in order to still be able to upgrade? For one, I think you will 
need to set expectations here towards the maintainers if a package is 
never included in a stable release, as they get very muddy otherwise. 
Plus you need to set expectations for the users as the next package 
(maybe not gitlab) might come up with requirements that upgrades need to 
go through every version on the way to, say, update the database 
properly. And that's hardly supportable unless everyone knows to update 
quickly.
[1] I would like to re-register my objection to that name for the same 
reason Holger stated: it is confusing to reuse an older name (which, by 
the way, started outside of Debian, too and was then merged in) with a 
new concept.
