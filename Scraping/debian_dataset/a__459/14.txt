This is answered in the proposal. The reason is to not have volatile abused to ease backporting, and to allow packages to easily move back to backports again.

I am a bit disappointed that my efforts to emphasize good compatibility with established processes is interpreted that way.
As I already laid out several times during the last days, I am in fact disappointed that assuming bad or egoistic intentions seems to have become normal in Debian.
That said, the version numbering is a way to ensure work *with* established rules, not around.

I did not discuss this proposal before discussing this proposal, no. That's why I am discussing this proposal :).
If you read it properly, you will find that does not add anything really new, but extends something existing - yet without interfering with it much.

Again, the change is not new - it is an extension of backports, using the exact same concepts and rules, apart from the source distribution and the target directory. It is an extension designed to play very nicely with backports.

I hope that e.g. official buildds will not grab code from my private machine and build it, for example.
