hmm, would that conflict w/ having certain "nodejs-$version" subdirs
w/ the actual engines (the whole tree - not splitted out the several
FHS parts yet) there ?
Meanwhile I've also added some update-alternatives support. (yet have
to add version into package name). But this will conflict w/ current
versions, as they directly install /usr/bin/nodejs. Can we make a minor
update of 0.10.* for update-alternatives ?

Actually, not sure whether that's really required. Are there any known
(already packaged) modules that break w/ newer nodejs ? If not, I guess,
just adding depend son newer engines where needed should be enough.
