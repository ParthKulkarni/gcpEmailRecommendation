Package: installation-reports
On running the installer manually from inside the OEM Windows installed, 
everything appeared to run smoothly up to the reboot following partition 
and formatting of the machines drives. On that boot the installer now 
running off the HDD began looping at the "Install base system" step, no 
errors or other signs of trouble - just display the progress bar for a 
few mins, then flick out to the step-by-step listing as if that step was 
done - but highlighting the same "Install base system" entry every time 
enter was pressed to start the step.
Manually going to the next step on the list failed with a message about 
the base system not being fully present.
Skipping to the shell for manual inspection showed that the path /cdrom 
was being searched for the image packages but non-existent already 
(expected after install is complete, but not halfway through). Since 
this was a USB based install the netinst image had been loaded as 
/media/cdrom, and /dev/cdrom was not a mountable device since the CD/DVD 
drive did not have a disk.
Manually creating a symlink "ln -s /media/cdrom /cdrom" allowed the 
installer to continue and successfully install the system.
NP: if this is not already fixed in the latest 1-2 installer versions it 
really should be handled for Stretch. This has a high potential for 
newbies "bricking" their machines since they will not readily know the 
manual fix necessary.

Just the one mentioned above. Same image has been used on prior machines 
and more recent one no problems. But those were all done starting from a 
boot from the USB containing installer image. This attempt seeing issues 
is the one and only time OEM's Windows install has needed to be used to 
bootstrap the installation process.
