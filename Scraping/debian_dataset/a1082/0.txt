While investigating this, I came to 
trunk/installer/build/needed-characters/
1. I could not find a file for Gujarati there. Maybe this is the reason for
   above problems?
2. However, there are also no files for Chinese. And Chinese looks fine in
   in the installer. So, is this directory/this concept still actively used?
3. Also, I found that the file for Tajik is named "tg" but all the files
   have to be named "XX.utf" which makes me wonder, if this is a bug in
   the filenaming or again: is this still in use?
Also, I wonder where is defined what font to use for which language.
In trunk/scripts/g-i/ I found "lang2font" and "lang2range" which could be
an answer to this question, but I couldn't find that these are used
somewhere at all ...
The D-I Internals or the i18n-guide did not tell me much about this, and
the wiki pages are apparently at little (or much) outdated, so docu on
building the graphical installer currently seems to be a problem?
Maybe someone has some knowledge to share?
Holger
