Hi there,
Let me nitpick a bit: ;-)

The official package description appears to be:
"Is retry allowed for Error?"
And while that is still a bit vague, it does at least give an
indication what the module does, while I have no idea what
"my prime module" is supposed to mean?
I would urge you to use upstream's description when packaging
this module.
