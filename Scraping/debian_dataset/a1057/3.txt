For Debian buildds, I really want the full log, because for failures on
some architecture I don't personally have, it's so, so much easier to see
the full compilation command line with all of its flags and so forth.
Often I can fix the problem without needing access to the architecture,
which saves a lot of time messing about with porter boxes and setting up a
proper build environment there.
It would be great to be able to automatically distinguish between
important stuff and noise and provide both views, although given the wide
variety of different tools we use, it's probably not possible in general.
But things like this may be a nice solution for the 80% case.
