My old Mac Mini had a crazy clock and ntp was not enough to sanitize it.
I fixed it by using adjtimex in addition to ntp.
As an example, my clock was off by 2890 parts per million, so I used
this in /etc/default/adjtimex:
TICK=10028
FREQ=5898240
# 28 * 100 + 5898240 / 65536 = 2890 ppm
This used to work very well, but OTOH I had my computer always on, so
I'm not sure it the cases are similar.
Thanks.
