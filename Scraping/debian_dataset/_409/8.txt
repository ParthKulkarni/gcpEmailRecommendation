No, they have not. There is a lot of handwaving in this thread but very 
few results of actual tests.
After creating again unmerged chroots for the buildds the only bugs 
left, archive-wide, are #860523 (an abandoned package with no reverse 
dependencies, there is even a patch in the BTS) and #913883 (iptables 
mixing manually-created symlinks and diversions).
A few bugs in other packages have been reported and fixed over the years:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=usrmerge;users=md@linux.it
So we have:
- very few bugs exposed in other packages
- a track record of them being fixed
These are facts. People being worried if it would work or not on their 
own system are just showing emotions, which are usually not relevant in 
engineering decisions.

This is only partially relevant because after the conversion there is no 
reason to keep the package around and it can just be removed.
