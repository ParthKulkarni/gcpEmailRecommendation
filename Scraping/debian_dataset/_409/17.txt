You keep referring to usrmerge as buggy:

Sorry to be blunt about this, but have you reported these? Sniping at (any) 
package without making the problems you see visible to others (through bugs) 
is not really helpful.

usrmerge is in the archive for 3+ years now. What seems to be needed now is 
for a lot of us to actually _try_ it, find and report bugs, and get this 
through.
Don't forget that a specificity of our bug report system is that the only 
measure of "it worked without issues" that we have is popcon; we only get a 
measure of how much things fail, not how good they work:

(Funnily enough, it seems to have had a recent spikeâ€¦)
