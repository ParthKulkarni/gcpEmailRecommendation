Of course you do have backups.  For the sake of the argument, would you 
consider trying an install of usrmerge on a restored backup VM somewhere?
Maybe I'm overlooking something, but it seems that installing usrmerge on a 
production system is going to be a _much_ less demanding task proceeding with 
a stable upgrade.
