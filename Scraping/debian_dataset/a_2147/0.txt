"we should do so many things"
Thing I say about it:  Please do.
Whom ever steps forward for taking the Debian.org website in maintenance:
 * Downtime for several hours is fine
 * Is it okay to switch to a divert Version Control System. Yes, please move away from CVS
 * If translation workflow breaks, so be it. One challenge/problem at a time
 * The change will also effect the www-team. That is good
