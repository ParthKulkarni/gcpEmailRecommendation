Just to make things a bit clearer for people who may not have followed
some of the discussions on d-bp-users lately: the point is to be able to
support fast-moving software with not-so-fast moving dependencies;
the dependencies may easily be backported without too large a burden
(their versions will not come too often, so they will be able to migrate
 to testing and thus fulfil the criteria for being in backports), while
the main piece of software moves too fast, including across major
versions and with incompatible changes, so that it is not suitable for
being included in a stable release (thus the part in the proposal about
blocking its migration to testing).
The maintainers of the stack will first package the dependencies, wait
for them to migrate to testing, then backport them, and then they will
upload the main piece of software first to unstable and then to the new
suite under discussion.
G'luck,
Peter
