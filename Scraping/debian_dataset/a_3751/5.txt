I have considered it, but it will effectively lead to a situation where
I cannot ever make a new compat level.
The point of compat levels is to change behaviour in an incompatible
way.  Because it is opt-in, a new compat level breaks 0 packages (except
a handful of early adopters).  Whereas if I implement a named "latest"
compat level, then I possibly break every single package with that named
compat level.
  As more and more adopt it, the compat bump will break more and more
packages leading to a situation where it is nearly impossible for me to
implement an actual compat bump.
(This would have been less problematic if we could determine exactly
which packages are affected and how they are affected, so we could do
MBF before the bump.  However, that it is impractical for many changes.)
Thanks,
~Niels
PS: For the curious, this is also why I retracted the named
"beta-tester" compat level that existed in most of debhelper 10 just
before announcing the compat 11 beta.
