Best achieved by using reportbug, which gets all the details right so
that those who need to, can filter out WNPP related bug reports.

A hat, a hotel. a helmet. Unless the speaker has a dialect where
they're an hat ("an 'at"), etc. It seems Cockney is one such dialect.
I'm not a native speaker. The rule I was taught is "it's an if the
next word starts with a vowel _sound_ when spoken". Javascript starts
with a J sound. An elephant starts with a trumpet sound, which kind of
a vowel.
English is too complicated. We should all switch to Finnish instead.
Free Finnish lessons at Debconf. Lipputangonnuppi.
To bring this into the topic of Debian development, there used to be
people running spell checkers on package descriptions. Is that still
happening?
