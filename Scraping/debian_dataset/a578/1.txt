Martin also mentioned he "wouldn't veto" the inclusion even if the
functionality was not completely there, although he'd prefer a better
"OOTB experience".

Dimitry sent another mail asking for a reproducer in the form of a VM or
similar. And mentioned being worried about missing the freeze deadline.

Dimitry mentioned on the NMU announcement that (obviously) the
maintainers were free to cancel the NMU themselves.

Michael requested the cancelation (which he could also have done
himself) 14 days after the initial upload.

Dimitry refused to cancel the NMU *himself*.

Please do not overload the existing meaning of hijacking in the Debian
context. There was no package hijack here at all. There was though, an
unwanted NMU, which personally I find to be a bad form of social
interaction within Debian.

But the maintainers had 15 days to cancel it themselves. Personally I
think not canceling an NMU one has done, which has been subsequently
deemed unwated to be quite rude, but still.
I think you are blowing this a bit out of proportion TBH?
