I don't think anything has changed.

If the question is "whether I should send the changes to the upstream
authors or to the maintainer" then nothing has changed.
If the question is "how should I send a patch to the maintainer" then a
pull request is just one of the available ways, and the best one was
always opening a bug report in the BTS, sending the changes in some other
way directly to the maintainer was always possible too.
