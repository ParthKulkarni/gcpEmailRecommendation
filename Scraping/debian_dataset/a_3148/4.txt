FWIW I'm going to be very reluctant to add support to Launchpad until
and unless it's supported in Debian, for exactly the reasons of
fragmentation, compatibility, etc.  I said as much in
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2018-March/040222.html
too.
(Without support in Launchpad, the format isn't going to be widespread
in Ubuntu.)
