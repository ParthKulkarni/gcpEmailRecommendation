Dear Debian devel,
I'm looking into how to package bazel these days. But found it is a bit
hard and I need some suggestions.
Bazel is a build system. Means it is something like cmake, autotools, ant.
First, bazel definitely needs some cleaning. It has some built-in libs
which should be package to Debian first. But that's fine because I'll do it.
The problem is, bazel 4.0.1 is the last version that can be built
directly inside Debian because it can be built from scratch by its own
shell script.
Later bazel version build depends on ealier version. That means, 4.0.2
depends on 4.0.1. And 4.0.3 depends on 4.0.2.
So my question is does that mean I need to package (and clean-up
built-in libs) for 4.0.1 first. And uploading 4.0.1 to Debian. And then
start to package 4.0.2 .. until to the latest? It is similar to gcc
compiles itself by earlier version. Just want to know how to solve this
and the best practice.
Yours,
Paul
