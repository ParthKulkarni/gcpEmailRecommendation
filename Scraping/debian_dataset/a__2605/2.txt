Ie, virtio vs emulating a real piece of hardware.
The problem here, though, is that qemu picked a piece of hardware that's old
crap that's not expected in any physical arm64 gardware.  I guess it'd be
good to ask them to upgrade, like they did with the Cirrus card on x86.
Ordinarily I'd want you to support this "hardware" as QEMU is a major
platform (at least the one most available), but in this case, with the
extensive incantations required to get it running, requiring virtio might be
acceptable.  I refuse to say "arguments" rather than "incantations" as
the former is for specifying what the program should do and what you want
altered from reasonable defaults, rather than a massive ritual that needs to
be performed just to get basic functionality, with every piece involving
lengthy research and breakage/data loss if you skip it.  Like, my line lacks
a flash for storing EFI vars, meaning that it will install correctly (with
mini.iso), work when rebooted, even upon multiple reboots, then fail to work
anymore once you shut down qemu and start it again.
So I wonder what's the best way to proceed.  Probably documenting what's
needed might be a good step.
