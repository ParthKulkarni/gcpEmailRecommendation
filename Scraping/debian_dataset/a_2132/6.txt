webkit2gtk does guarantee API stability.
    "We support each major Debian version until one year after
     the release of the next major version."

I'm actually writing this e-mail from a web-based e-mail client
using the latest stable release of webkit2gtk (2.16.13) that I just
built for Debian jessie (which ships 2.6.2).
What webkit2gtk cannot guarantee is zero regressions between
stable releases, and there have been a couple of annoying ones.
So yes, it can happen that updating webkit2gtk breaks an
rdep (#855103). Unfortunately it can also happen that NOT
updating webkit2gtk breaks an rdep (#862156).
The good news is that the first kind of problems are detected and
fixed immediately, so waiting a couple of weeks before uploading
the releases to debian-security could be an option (is that what
Ubuntu does?).
