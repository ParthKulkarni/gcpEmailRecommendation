For the past 9 months, the development version of Ubuntu tests the
beta versions of the new major webkit2gtk release (for instance Zesty
tested the 2.15.90 releases). This has been useful in catching
regressions before they ever hit a stable webkit2gtk release.
If a webkit2gtk release fixes publicized CVEs, the release is now
pushed as a security update into Ubuntu Stable Releases fairly
quickly.
