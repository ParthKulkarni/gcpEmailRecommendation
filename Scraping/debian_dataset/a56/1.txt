We should be fixing this bug to stop using apt-key, and start putting
files under the right location with the right filename:
  https://bugs.debian.org/851774
This would render the need for gnupg moot, as we would move away from
using a deprecated way of adding keys.
For some reason we haven't managed to get that fixed in time for
stretch, but let's see if we can make that happen soon. Added (back) to
my short term todo list.
Cheers,
