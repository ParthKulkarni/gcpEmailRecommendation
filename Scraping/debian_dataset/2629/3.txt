I agree that this needs fixing.

This was in fact open for interpretation.

I do not subscribe the edge case argument.  In the dir where I have
nearly all Git repositories of Debian Med team I have
$ find . -name debian -type d | grep -v \.git | wc -l
858
$ find . -name get-orig-source -type f | wc -l
119
I have not checked every single of these and with my recent knowledge
about obtaining the source from Git repositories via uscan some of these
might be droped.  But its roughly 10 percent of the packages (not only
released packages but also not yet finished preparations admittedly and
may be the percentage of get-orig-source scripts is higher there).

I'm not really happy with the "downgrade from policy to Developer's
Reference".  I would have loved if some more precise wording would
have been found for policy but as long as we can settle with some
clarified wording that's OK for me.
Kind regards
