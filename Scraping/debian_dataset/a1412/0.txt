I remember Simon doing quite a few of Wayland related bug reports, and
at least some of them were usertagged as
User: pkg-gnome-maintainers@alioth.debian.org
Usertags: wayland
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=pkg-gnome-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org;tag=wayland
It would probably be good if you also use those when doing your bug reports.
Regards,
Michael
