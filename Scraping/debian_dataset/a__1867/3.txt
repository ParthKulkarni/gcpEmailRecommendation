That includes some changes we don't like during the freeze, but given those were
done before the freeze and I wouldn't want them reverted this early in the
freeze, I would be happy to unblock this... but can you attach a binary debdiff
(e.g. debdiff an old and new .changes file) to make sure things are still
looking good?
Also please make minimal changes from now on (e.g. for 1.1.0e).
Cyril, does this look fine from a d-i perspective at this stage?
Cheers,
Emilio
