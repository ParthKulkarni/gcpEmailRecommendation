Hello,
do we (or someone else) have a database of all (source-)packages and
their versions ever released in a Debian suite?
I'm interested in all point releases and also historic suites.
For example
<https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=php5&searchon=sourcenames&exact=1&suite=all&section=all>
shows
> Quellcode-Paket php5
> wheezy (web): 5.4.45-0+deb7u8 [security] 
> jessie (php): 5.6.30+dfsg-0+deb8u1 [security] 
but I would like to know which exact version was is 7.0, 7.1, .., 7.7
and 8.0, too.
I guess <https://wiki.debian.org/ProjectB> would work, but I'm denied
login permission on "mirror.ftp-master.debian.org".
