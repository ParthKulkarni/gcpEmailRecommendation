In addition to what Colin and Mattia said, repackaging/removing
convenience copies is sometimes also done for other reasons, e.g.
- when the embedded files take a huge percentage of the package size
- to make sure they are really not used during the build process 
In cases where third-party files are not removed for DFSG reasons,
usually the version is not created with a +dfsg suffix but frequently
with +ds (debian source).
