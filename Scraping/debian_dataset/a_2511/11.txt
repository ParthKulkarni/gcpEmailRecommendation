Thanks a lot for this effort.  We really appreciate this kind of
support.

I've cloned this and was able to build the package.  I think you can
solve the lintian warning
  W: dh-cmake source: ancient-python-version-field x-python3-version 3.2
by simply removing
  X-Python3-Version: >= 3.2
from d/control.  Manpages for the tools in /usr/bin would be nice.

I'll try with the next cmake package I'll touch.  If you can give
some examples this would be helpful.

Thanks a lot to you
