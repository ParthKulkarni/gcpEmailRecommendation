I'm Lisandro and, even if I'm listed as one of Debian's CMake maintainers I 
must admit I barely have put my hands into it's packaging.
But on the other side I happen to maintain Qt (which does not uses CMake) and 
a lot of Qt based applications (which *do* use CMake). I even use it for 99% 
of my personal/job projects!

A thing that it's not clear to me: can the Debian maintainer override whatever 
upstream has set in there?
If upstream happens to be the Debian maintainer then *maybe* this might be 
desirable. But if upstream is *not* the Debian maintainer then the later must 
be able to easily override whatever upstream has planned as "packaging".
I mean: upstreams normally know how to develop their code, and maintainers 
know how to properly deploy it on their distro. If i as a maintainer need to 
hack CMake files in order to make a package install stuff in the right place 
then I would simply prefer to override whatever upstream has done and use our 
tooling.

Debian buildds do not allow network connections. Except maybe if some day we

Well, my feedback is clear: if we maintainers do not have an easy way to 
override upstream's *packaging* decisions then I will clearly not suggest 
fellow maintainers to use dh-cmake.
All that being said discussing details in this list might be appropiate. We 
might find a use for it which suites both sides :-)
Kinds regards, Lisandro.
