Right. In general, I do agree that this is the more likely of
possibilities. The required ordering of redirections is just confusing,
tbh.

Yes, I think so; or more generally, where the stderr output is caught
futher on. E.g., something like this wouldn't be a bug either:
ERRORS=$(foo 2>&1 1>/dev/null)
But again, I do agree that in general, the assumption that the ordering
of redirections was mistaken is probably the right one.
