I found that when I switched my laptop from sysvinit to systemd, this started
to work flawlessly.
I'm not saying you need to switch to systemd if you haven't yet already,
but it might be a bug in whatever you're using to suspend, rather than
in Linux in general.

Don't use that anymore, personally, so no idea.

These are all implemented by ACPI on modern hardware. You need to have
something that turns the ACPI events into something useful.
If you have acpid installed, it usually turns the ACPI events into X11
key events, which you can monitor with the "xev" tool. It is then up to
your window manager to do something useful with that (or up to you to
configure your window manager to do so).
Most desktop environments' window managers deal with all that the right
way, but if you're using something more basic, you might have to deal
with it yourself. For instance, at one point I added the following to my
awesomewm's rc.lua:
    awful.key({ }, "XF86MonBrightnessDown", function() awful.util.spawn("xbacklight -dec 5") end),
    awful.key({ }, "XF86MonBrightnessUp", function() awful.util.spawn("xbacklight -inc 5") end),
    awful.key({ modkey }, "XF86MonBrightnessDown", function() awful.util.spawn("xbacklight -set 1") end),
    awful.key({ modkey }, "XF86MonBrightnessUp", function() awful.util.spawn("xbacklight -set 100") end),
(this doesn't work currently because the Intel KMS driver doesn't
support xbacklight, but that's a different matter)

Haven't gotten that to do anything useful, but then I also don't want it
to (I just run xrander and tell it what I want changed).

I've not had any serious issues over the past three laptops:
- Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook E734 (current)
- Lenovo X220 (N-1)
- HP something (cheap one, crappy battery life, N-2)
Sometimes you need to fiddle with configuration a bit if you're not
using things like gnome or KDE that set it all up for you, but that's
the choice you make.
