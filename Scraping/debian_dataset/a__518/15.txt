There are various situations in which this could come up.
A package might have multiple uploaders, with one or two of them working
on a big, potentially disruptive upload.  A third uploader, not involved
in the current work, might want to review and merge uploadable changes,
without interfering with the work going on in the master branch.  They
can put them on the next/foo branch.
Alternatively, someone might be burnt out by their work on the master
branch.  They want to put aside the next upload for a while, and review
some other fixes that have been submitted.  Having a next/foo branch to
which they can commit these reviewed changes permits them to properly
step away from the master branch, relieving them of the need to think
hard about which changes can be safely combined with the upcoming
upload.

To reserve the next/foo namespace for this purpose.
