Could you explain which parts of the proposal you find to be "very
complicated"?  Possibly I've made them seem much more complicated than
they actually are.

Don't apologise for providing feedback :)  I'm grateful for it.
After reading comments in this thread, I think that the main use of
next/foo branches is likely to be for packages which lack repos on
alioth.  Otherwise, as you say, the contributor could use a PR.
If a package does not have a repo on alioth, the only way for me to
contribute a fix is to NMU, which always creates work for the
maintainer, or file a bug report with patches.
With this DEP, I can push a next/foo branch, and file a bug pointing to
it.  This means neither the maintainer nor contributor need mess around
with patch files.
