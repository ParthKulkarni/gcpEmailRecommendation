Until this point I thought you would summarize with a suggestion that we 
get v6 included in next stable Debian release (i.e. a plea to the 
release team to make an exception from their general rules).

Do I understand you correctly that you recommend that we all tell our 
users - e.g. in release notes - something like this: "We acknowledge 
that the Nodejs included in this release is outdated, and recommend that 
you avoid it: Please instead subscribe to our snapshot repository and 
use the newer (but lesser supported) version from there."?
