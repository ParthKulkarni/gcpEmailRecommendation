Hi,
i really think it would be best to have nodejs 6.9 in next debian release.
That version is currently in experimental and i was about to upload it
to unstable, but i tried to do things right and prepared the addons
that need to be rebuilt and binNMUed, then opened a transition bug
#849505.
No answer yet, people are busy, and the number of concerned packages
is low (a dozen or so), should i just rebuild and upload them myself ?
