I'm using the keyrings from keyring.debian.org instead of the
packaged ones. That way they are up to date and I don't have the
write errors:
% crontab -l | grep debian-keyring
30 17 * * * /usr/bin/rsync -rlptDq "keyring.debian.org::keyrings/keyrings/*.gpg" /home/gregoa/.gnupg/debian-keyring
(copied from someone/somewhere)
% grep debian-keyring ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf 
keyring /home/gregoa/.gnupg/debian-keyring/debian-keyring.gpg
keyring /home/gregoa/.gnupg/debian-keyring/debian-maintainers.gpg
keyring /home/gregoa/.gnupg/debian-keyring/debian-nonupload.gpg
keyring /home/gregoa/.gnupg/debian-keyring/debian-role-keys.gpg
keyring /home/gregoa/.gnupg/debian-keyring/emeritus-keyring.gpg
Cheers,
gregor
