Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.88
Severity: wishlist
Hi!
If for whatever reason you want or need to build your own kernels, the
preferred way these days is "make bindeb-pkg".  It is also a good idea
to use CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y, which marks the exact tree used to
build the kernel.
However, with this option, the version is _appended_ after local version,
thus making it hard to add that "-armmp" string.
I found no way to override this, other than manually editing

 echo "flash-kernel: installing version $kvers" >&2
 
 mkarch="$(get_mkimage_architecture $kvers)"
Just allowing an empty string flavour doesn't work, as it'll still want a -
after the version.
Thus, it would nice if there was an override -- or, perhaps, I'm holding it
wrong?
Meow!
