And in what context would you find yourself trying to run a Debian init
system in such an environment?  oldstable has a 3.16 kernel; oldoldstable
has 3.2, but that means it will be oldoldoldstable when buster is released. 
Do you actually expect any guarantees that the buster userspace will be
compatible with a kernel of release-3 vintage?
If so, I think you have an uphill battle to codify such an expectation in
the release-critical bug guidelines.
If not, I think you will find other userspace incompatibilities creeping in.
In particular, I expect glibc's minimum kernel compatibility level to
continue to ratchet up.
