Unfortunately, on some embedded and/or mobile systems, one has
to stick to an old Linux kernel, even when using the latest user
space. Systemd needs at least Linux 3.13.
I'm not sure, whether missing SysV support is wishlist, minor,
or normal. I would accept normal, but some maintainers would
downgrade severity.
The best solution (IMHO) would be dropping SysV support in all
packages and use systemd-to-sysvinit-converterÂ¹ in case of need.
I never tried it myself, however.
