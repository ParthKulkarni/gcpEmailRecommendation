In my understanding of "universal" (Debian, operating system, y'know)
the goal should be to run on as many platforms as reasonably possible.
So unless there's good reason against it - like having other
dependencies on systemd - packages should continue to ship init files.

Given the huge amount of bugs in init scripts[1], this seems like a very
good idea.

Ditto :)  Does it support systemd generators to start with?

[1] A while ago I estimated[how?] a quarter of the init scripts around
    does not properly check and wait for the daemon termination in the
    "stop" action, possibly leading to loss of service as in #802040
