Package: debian-installer
Version: 20180610
Hello,
When trying to install Debian Buster on an arm64 system via a vga
console (for example a BMC console or attached GPU with UEFI +
X86EmulatorPkg) the debian-installer process itself appears to launch
on the serial console (so is invisible to the user).
It is possible to simply alt+F2 to another window, open up a new
console then manually invoke debian-installer from there and proceed
with an install. So this bug is not a blocker.
Cheers,
