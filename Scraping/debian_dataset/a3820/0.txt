There is a tegra laptop that uses nouveau, though I think it was armhf,
not arm64 (not sure if this bug is specifically about arm64).
There are at least two arm64 laptops, but as far as I know they both
currently just support simplefb, though I'm not sure what needs to
change in debian-installer to support them; just tried the pinebook
earlier today without much luck getting d-i running on the tty displayed
on the LCD.
live well,
