OK. Last time I used Radeon cards few years ago - before amdgpu driver.
HD5450 worked fine in arm64 machine without being initialized by
mainboard firmware - Linux was able to get it running with loading it's
firmware from hard drive.
But yeah - non-free part. Which (according to [1]) can be put on install
media by user.

As above.

Now I know why there is nearly no desktop-class hardware for arm64 - no
one believes that it will have any use. When all what is needed is one
change to kernel packaging.
There are people using Macchiatobin, Synquacer etc boards as their
desktops. I do not expect them to have to use serial cables just to
install operating system.
