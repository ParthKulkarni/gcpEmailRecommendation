This seems ... quite a striking error.
What on earth possessed them to pick the name `dune' ?  Even if they
couldn't be bothered to do a Debian file search,
 https://www.google.com/search?q=dune+software
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(software)
 https://www.google.com/search?q=%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Fdune
Under the circumstances it seems obvious that no-one should be allowed
the name /usr/bin/dune.
Ian.
