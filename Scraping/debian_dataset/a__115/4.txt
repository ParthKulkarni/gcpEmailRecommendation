I see you have started [1], which is a very good start. Past submissions
have been made using a wiki page just like you did. When the submission
is ready, I start the evaluation by sending your proposal to a public
mailing list. There is a minimum discussion period of two weeks before
a decision may be announced.
[1] https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTaiwan/ocf.tw/TrustedOrganizationCriteria
I have gone through your page and here are my first remarks:
- The bylaws are not in english and are not stored in a file (I see you use
  a pad to share it). You may want to publish it on a webpage or a flat file
  with a version or a date. Having it in english is not mandatory as some
  countries enforce the use of local language for official documents, but
  an english version will greatly help during the discussion.
- Links to financial reports, annual meetings, past organized events are
  important... but explaining the process is also needed. For example:
  * How reimbursement are handled? In which currency?
  * What is the structure of ocf.tw? And how decisions are taken?
  * Where and when reports are published?
- You can find at [2] current list of Debian Trusted Organizations. Each one
  them has gone through the process and you can find the criteria link which
  can be useful for inspiration or to better understand the nature of the
  discussion that will occur.
