Ah, OK. Thanks for the logs, they look rather good to me…
sda doesn't look like something too tricky:

Did you try some kernel command line parameters, like enabling debug,
disabling quiet, maybe disabling modesetting? You could also try adding
netconsole parameters to send kernel messages elsewhere if you're
getting no output at all.
Differences between installation and installed systems include: plain
init versus systemd, fbdev being used for Xorg in d-i; also, sometimes,
some modules are missing from the initrd because initramfs-tools didn't
include them (while d-i uses different codepaths to enable hardware
support). I assume yours is using the default MODULES=most anyway
(unless you tweaked it)?
