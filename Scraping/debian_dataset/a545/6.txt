I suppose the information it downloads is needed to keep the database
up to date. Thinking about a lifetime of ~5 years (stable+oldstable),

Depends on what information you put in /tmp/openvpn.conf, I guess. The
least likely candidates end up opening holes - i.e. remember the quite
recent KDE notifier bug allowing FAT volume labels containing $() to
be executed :-P
I mean - It might be completely OK. But given this creates
configuration for setting up a high-privileged daemon from a public
place, it'd be on you to carefully comb on the relevant parts of the
source to assert the handling of this information is sensible.
