Hi Debian-i18n team!
Please, use this update file for the country names attached!
For some reasons, the country name "Turkey" was automatically translated from the TM as "–ú—É—Ä“ì–∏ –º–∞—Ä“∑–æ–Ω", but this name stands for bird name "Turkey bird". So, translation of "Turkey" is corrected to "–¢—É—Ä–∫–∏—è" that stands for the country name. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Please, use this file and confirm safe receipt.
Thank you so much!
Victor

Hi Debian-i18n team!
The following files are now 100% translated and contains improvements:
1)	Sublevel1
2)	Sublevel2
3)	Sublevel4
4)	Sublevel5
Tajik translation in Sublevel3 was updated ‚Äì translation is ongoing.
5) Country names for Debian Installer are now 100% translated and attached.
I will resend/dublicate the same file to Tobias under the relevant thread: Re: iso-codes -- Re: RE: Tajik translation for debian-installer
The iso files from https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/i386/daily/netboot/ and https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/i386/daily/netboot/gtk/ do not contain updated translations in Tajik language.
Could you please, rebuild the iso files including the Tajik translations for sublevels and country names committed by Today. I would like to go through the installation process and check Tajik translations in live and see if updates are needed to improve declination of words/verbs for readability.
Thank you and have a great day!
Victor

"Done" is not something negative (even it sounds like this).
It means, adding Tajik to the debian-installer as a new language is completed. 
When a translator comes up and says "I want to provide translation for the installer into the <xyz> language", while xyz is not included in the installer at all at that time (you can say: starting a new translation from scratch), then Christian used to start what was called the "New Language Process" (NLP).
This is documented here:
https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/doc/i18n/ch03.html
The NLP for Tajik has happened in 2013, but it has forgotten be completed somehow, which is now done.
> How the language is supported after the "NLP - Done" status?
As all the other languages, translators are encouraged to keep their translation up-to-date, which you are working on.
BTW: there are some more sublevels to complete ;-))) And translation is included is in the installer, that's it :-)
Cheers
Holger
