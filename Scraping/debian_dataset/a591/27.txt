I have sent the files to your mail address. Did you receive them?
Could you sent me a quick note, if you still intend to work on them?
Otherwise I would try to look for other translators ...
(I don't want to annoy you, and there is no hurry with this translation,
please don't feel be put on pressure!)

PS: if you prefer, you can use the Weblate web-frontend for translation
now: 
https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-installer/
Just drop me a note, I can enable Tajik for Weblate, if you like.
