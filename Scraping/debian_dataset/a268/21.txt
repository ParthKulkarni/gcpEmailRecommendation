Hi,
rather than trying to appeal to authority like Marc - I could have been
wrong -, I will point out that my first point was not actually addressed
at all:
++ mktemp -d /dev/shm/pw.sh.XXXXXXXXXXXXX
+ WORKDIR=/dev/shm/pw.sh.JHasAYH9zwYz1
[...]
+ decrypt /home/pkern/.pw/pw.tgz
+ local archive=/home/pkern/.pw/pw.tgz
+ local 'opts=--quiet --yes --batch '
+ [[ -z '' ]]
+ gpg2 --quiet --yes --batch --passphrase-fd 0 /home/pkern/.pw/pw.tgz.gpg
+ local err=0
+ [[ 0 -ne 0 ]]
+ tar -xzf /home/pkern/.pw/pw.tgz -C /dev/shm/pw.sh.JHasAYH9zwYz1
+ rm -f /home/pkern/.pw/pw.tgz
This clearly writes the unencrypted tarball out to disk.
Now you might say "I will fix that". But I think the behavior in this
thread was sufficient evidence to not package this in Debian. I know it
is hard to deal with criticism and I could have phrased my mail
differently, but this is clearly not the way. What if there is another
contentious bug? Will you also insult your users and your fellow
developers (no matter how senior)?
I could not have phrased it better than Simon with "let's not try to
audit scripts without `set -e`" and his other point of not using shell
scripts for non-trivial matters. Yes, it's a valid language. Yes, people
can write good scripts in it. But it is very hard and this thread has
not given me evidence that the creation process of this script mastered
it. Especially how hard it is to reason about a script that can fail
silently in all places. Especially if it's something that handles a
user's secrets.

And these ad hominems are just unhelpful.
Kind regards
