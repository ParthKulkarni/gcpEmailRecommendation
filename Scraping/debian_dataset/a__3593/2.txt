Hi Vagrant,
I believe that we should expect the generic boot-script to just work.
If it doesn't that will be because of bugs in our boot menu script, and
we can fix those outside of Debian.
For the next two to 3 weeks I won't have time to acquire that
environment, but maybe I can get someone else to post it.
As to the models: Yes, those seem correct. So we will need an entry for
each of them?
Supported kernel flavors: armmp, no lpae.
What I was asking before is if it is possible to have a wildcard entry
for the device variants that would always copy a set of DTBs to /boot,
to make moving the sdcard between devices easier.
But this is just a wishlist item, if flash-kernel doesn't work that way,
so be it.
Also: is there a way to modify this later if we ever want to be able to
install directly to nand flash(meaning kernel and rootfs) in such a way
that people can choose during install if they want to use sdcard or nand?
Such that when installed to sdcard, flash-kernel will never touch nand
flash, and vice versa?
Again, another wishlist item.
