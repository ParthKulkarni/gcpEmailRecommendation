Can you include the output from the u-boot prompt of "printenv" ? This
would be necessary to figure out what might need to go into a boot
script.

It looks like the models for those are:
arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-gta04a3.dts:    model = "Goldelico GTA04A3";
arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-gta04a4.dts:    model = "Goldelico GTA04A4";
arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-gta04a5.dts:    model = "Goldelico GTA04A5";
So an entry like:
Machine: Goldelico GTA04A3
DTB-Id: omap3-gta04a3.dtb
Would get the dtb files copied where they go.
More information would be needed to write a boot script for this.
