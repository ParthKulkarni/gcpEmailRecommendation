Sorry for the quick addition: a secodn uncertainty lies in the name of
the boot script.
We currently search for a bootargs.scr which was supposed to let distros
set a few boot options, and then return control back to the menu.
So maybe the name should be boot.scr instead. I will update once this
has been decided.
