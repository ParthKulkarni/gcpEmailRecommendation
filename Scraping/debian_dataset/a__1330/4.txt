Hi,
sorry for digging up that old thread from 2014, but it's exactly what
I wanted to bring up, just with today's needs and possibilities:
* CVE-2016-1252 in APT showed that HTTPS might still bring additional
  security. After that issue, the amount of people asking for
  HTTPS-secured Debian mirrors noticeably raised, see e.g. the edits
  and comments from 2016 to answers to the 2013 question
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90227/why-there-is-no-https-transport-for-debian-apt-tool/
* With Let's Encrypt it's much easier for mirror admins to get SSL
  certificates for ftp.$COUNTRY.debian.org and their local mirror
  hostname without having to fall back to using SNI or not providing
  SSL or at least not proper SSL certificates on all hostnames. (The
  latter still seems rather common, see below.)

Especially with Let's Encrypt, getting proper SSL certificates for all
DNS entries pointing to a mirror shouldn't be such a big issue
anymore. See e.g. https://ftp.ch.debian.org/ aka
https://debian.ethz.ch/ which have a single SSL certificate for hosts
under different second-level domains.

This is probably still an issue despite getting an updated certificate
via Let's Encrypt can be done much quicker than in the past.
Nevertheless there still will be a short downtime without valid
certificate when switching DNS entries.
A wildcard certificate for selected (e.g. DSA-maintained) mirrors
which then would be used as backup host for any primary mirror,
which already provides HTTPS access, would probably suffice.
Example: When ftp.ch.debian.org goes down for longer maintenance we
usually redirected that CNAME to one of the hosts around
kassia.debian.org (ftp.nl.debian.org or similar) where also one of the
European syncproxies is located.
So I can imagine the following setup to mitigate this:
* We track which mirrors (also) provide HTTPS in Mirrors.masterlist.
* If a primary mirror which doesn't provide HTTPS goes down, we
  redirect it to the same mirror as we did in the past.
* If one with HTTPS in central Europe goes down, we redirect it to
  that mirror on kassia.debian.org given that it will have a wildcard
  SSL certificate for ftp*.*.debian.org or similar. (We should look at
  ftp*.*.debian.org instead of just ftp.*.debian.org if possible
  because of mirrors like ftp2.de.debian.org.)
And since quite some mirrors already provide access via HTTPS, IMHO we
should start tracking them independent of having a proper solution to
temporary CNAME changes or not -- because they're in use already if
you want it or not.
So far I'm at least aware of the following working HTTPS mirrors
(picked out a few I read about in previous mailing list threads or
found out by quickly checking in a web browser):
* https://ftp.ch.debian.org/debian/ aka https://debian.ethz.ch/debian/
  (same mirror but two entries in the Mirrors.masterlist)
* https://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/
* https://ftp.cz.debian.org/debian/
* https://ftp.se.debian.org/debian/ (ftp.no.debian.org seems to point
  to the same host, but is not yet accessible via HTTPS due to not
  being listed in the certificate)
* https://mirrors.kernel.org/debian/
* https://mirror.sinavps.ch/debian/
* https://pkg.adfinis-sygroup.ch/debian/
* https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/debian/ (not yet accessible as
  https://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ due to certificate only being
  valid for ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de)
* https://mirrors.wikimedia.org/debian/ (not yet accessible as
  https://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ due to certificate only being
  valid for mirrors.wikimedia.org)
* https://mirror.as35701.net/debian/ (not yet accessible as
  https://ftp.be.debian.org/debian/ due to certificate only being
  valid for mirror.as35701.net)
A short scan over all mirrors in the Mirror.masterlist showed that
more than one third (176, around 38%) of them have at least port 443
open:
  → GET https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/webwml/webwml/english/mirror/Mirrors.masterlist\?view\=co \
    | egrep '^Site:' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | sort \
    | while read m ; do nmap -p443 $m; done \
    > https-mirrors.txt
  → ( echo -n 'scale=2;'`egrep -c '^443/tcp open  https' https-mirrors.txt`/; \
      egrep -c '^443/tcp.*https' https-mirrors.txt ) | bc
  .38
  → egrep -c '^443/tcp.*https' https-mirrors.txt
  455
  → egrep -c '^443/tcp open  https' https-mirrors.txt
  176
(Didn't check more certificates or subjectAltNames than those listed
above yet, though. Full list of hosts I found having port 443 open can
be found at the end of this mail.)
After having HTTPS-enabled mirrors listed in the Mirrors.masterlist,
the next step would be to make httpredir.debian.org HTTPS-aware.
Currently https://httpredir.debian.org/ shows me the following error
message:
  httpredir.debian.org uses an invalid security certificate.
  The certificate is only valid for www.debian.org
(Yes, I'm aware that httpredir.debian.org points to quite some
servers.)
Luckily the software behind httpredir.debian.org seems to be already
HTTPS-aware in some way. At least with Kali's HTTP redirector (which I
assume uses the same software), I get different mirror lists depending
on if I access the service by HTTP or HTTPS:

(And IIRC the Kali installer also offered me to choose if I want HTTP,
FTP or HTTPS mirrors, at least with debconf priority set to "low". No
more sure about Debian's installer on my last Stretch installation.)
