Package: di-netboot-assistant
Version: 0.51
Severity: minor
When attempting to install a daily image I get the following
========================================================================
# di-netboot-assistant install daily --arch=amd64
I: Processing daily/amd64.
I: Downloading 'SHA256SUMS'.
E: Could not download 
'https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/amd64/daily/../../../../Release' 
and/or 'Release.gpg'.
In the package provided di-sources.list file, in the daily section, 
there are the following comments,
It would be nice if the d-i daily's were signed, even if they had to use 
a different key that I would then need to install on the system so that 
this di-netboot-assistant check could use. Is there already a bug open 
requesting daily image signing? If not then maybe this one can be cloned 
and reassigned to the right place.
* add something to the error message detecting when installing daily and 
explaining it's known that daily images currently aren't signed
* add some sort of override option for daily images to skip the check, 
printing a warning. This would allow for calling di-netboot-assistant 
from other tools (scripts, puppet, etc)
* update the comments in di-sources.list explaining dailys aren't signed 
and will result in the warning prompt
* the 'Today' URL in the comments no longer exists, I couldn't find a 
good replacement
