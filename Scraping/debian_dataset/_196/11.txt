Maybe this is related:
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/43af16c99c800afdfc4b6913ea7596aaddd0395d
I.e., could you apply this upstream patch, make sure the udev rule is in
the udeb and try again?
If that doesn't help, we will need log files to debug this further.
A Xorg log from a working/non-working installer would be a start.
Regards,
Michael
