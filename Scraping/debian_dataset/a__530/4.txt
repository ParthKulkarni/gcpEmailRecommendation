While this certainly used to be true, I don't it has been the case for
a long time now? It seems like oral tradition to me now. :) There is I
think a single non-wishlist bug report against u-a in the BTS. So if
there are still problems I'd be more than happy to hear about them.
But regardless of the above, I think using alternatives would not be a
good idea, because then those programs cannot be diverted, something I
think at least molly-guard is doing. Also how to select the correct
priority?
I think what Lorenz proposes is a superior option.
Thanks,
Guillem
