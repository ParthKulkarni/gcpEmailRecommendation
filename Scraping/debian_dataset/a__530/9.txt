I'm fine with taking care of this if somebody tells me which file to
look for.  (The current mapping is "sysvinit:/lib/sysvinit/init
systemd:/lib/systemd/systemd upstart:/sbin/upstart"; the value needs to
be a path that can be coinstalled with other init systems and that can
be passed as the argument to "init=" on the kernel command line.)

This feels like overengineering and really not worth it; new inits don't
come along all that often.  I think we'd spend more time on transitional
mechanics than we'd ever save.

I quite agree.
