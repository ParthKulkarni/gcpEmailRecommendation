I believe this is a misconception based on an actual problem: the
alternatives system cannot be used for /bin/sh symlinks as 1. it uses shell
scripts itself (making it impossible to recover) and 2. is not atomic,
leaving a brief time window when there's no /bin/sh.
Nothing of that issue applies to /bin/init which is ever executed only
during the boot process then at controlled moment during package updates.
(I haven't been involved in that change, thus it's likely my belief is
inaccurate.)
