* Drop transitional sysvinit package. It has served its purpose for the
    wheezy â†’ jessie transition and keeping it around for longer only
    leads to confusion as it doesn't setup /etc/inittab which is necessary
    to boot with SysV. This functionality has moved into sysvinit-core,
    which should be used instead in such a case. (Closes: #781766)
