Currently, init system packages (sysvinit-core, runit-init,
systemd-sysv) are mutually exclusive -- each of them provides,
among other, /sbin/init file and as such, conflicts with rest.
This scheme has following drawbacks:
 * switching between init systems is destructive:
   once you switch, old /sbin/init is gone; should things go wrong, you
   have no easy recover via init=/sbin/old-init kernel option.
   Side note: switching from systemd is more safe, since systemd-sysv
   provides only link to /lib/systemd.
 * unneeded inter-dependencies. New system would require update of
   'Conflicts' field in rest packages.
 * After new init system is installed and old is removed, system is left
   running with old pid1 and no tools to control it, unless new system
   is providing compatibility.
I propose to replace current approach with update-alternatives(1)
approach.  By coordinated effort of present init systems (in thread), we
introduce master link /sbin/init and number of slave links:
	/sbin/halt
	/sbin/poweroff
	/sbin/reboot
	/sbin/runlevel
	/sbin/shutdown
	/usr/share/man/man8/halt.8.gz
	/usr/share/man/man8/init.8.gz
	/usr/share/man/man8/poweroff.8.gz
	/usr/share/man/man8/reboot.8.gz
	/usr/share/man/man8/runlevel.8.gz
	/usr/share/man/man8/shutdown.8.gz
After this is done, init systems will no longer conflict each other, and
all mentioned issues would be solved. I see it as clear win, but
probably I am missing something.
Opinions?
