Indeed, our goal is to do QA on maintainer script and to detect
(possibly) buggy ones, in the sense that they may fail in a 
unforeseen situation, or do stuff which the script is not supposed
to do. One of the difficulties is of course to know what it is
supposed to do, and what it must never do. Having a declaration
of what the maintainer thinks are the possible effects of a script
would certainly help us. In that case we could try to infer the
possible effects of a script and check that they do not exceed
what is declared.

yes, safety against a malicious attacker is a completely different
league. As Guillem has explained in his mail it is very difficult to
achieve due to the presence of many different attack vectors, and
their possible interaction.
