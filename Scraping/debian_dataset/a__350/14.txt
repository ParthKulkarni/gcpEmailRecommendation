The other problem is that the whitelist comes from the application
author, so it's like asking a drunk whether they are drunk.

Yes, I tried this on Fedora 28 before posting, which I consider the
reference implementation.  There is no security prompt at all.
I've also been told in an other context that it is up to the Flatpak
repository to vet the permissions requested by the software authors.
This model would be closer to what the Debian archive does in
practice.

I assume it's because gedit creates backup files when saving, and the
document portal does not support that.
