* default: install files in /usr only
* kernel: install files in /boot, trigger initramfs
* core: can install files anywhere, trigger anything
* maintained-by-liw: full power to do anything
This might be implemented in various ways. For example, dpkg could
create a temporary directory, and bind mount the directories the
profile indicates are needed, into a temporary shadow of the full
system. Maintainer scripts would be run in the shadow environment.
Thus, if they try to do something that isn't allowed by the packages
profile, they can't.
