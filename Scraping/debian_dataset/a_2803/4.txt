The time it takes a package to pass NEW is the first thing that comes to my 
mind. Having to wait for 6 months to get a package REJECTED for something that 
can be easily fixed, whether RC or not, is not fun.
Should we fix how the NEW queue works (adding more people seems to be failing 
so far) in a way that turn arounds are fast [enough], then yes, it wouldn't be 
so problematic.
[enough] I personally think in ~1 week, but YMMV.
