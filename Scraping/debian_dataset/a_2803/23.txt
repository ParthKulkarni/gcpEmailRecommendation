My main concern here is this: AFAICT this package has been REJECTed
solely for this reason.  Why is this bug[1] a reason for a REJECT ?
ISTM that it should be filed in the BTS and handled like a normal bug.
[1] Assuming it is a bug.  The discussion here suggests to me that it
is, but it is really unhelpful to be having it on debian-devel in the
context of an ftpmaster REJECTion.
