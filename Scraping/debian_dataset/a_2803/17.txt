Because:
 * Discussions about the RC bugs can be more effectively dealt with
   using our existing discussion mechanisms, including primarily the
   Debian BTS.  Compared to REJECT mails:
     - Discussions in the BTS are more transparent
     - Discussions in the BTS are better organised
     - Discussions in the BTS can have wider participation
     - Discussions in the BTS are better archived
     - Discussions in the BTS have better metadata
 * Publishing a work-in-progress in the Debian archive enables more
   people to more easily help improve and fix it.
 * Once a package is accepted metadata about it, and parts of it, are
   automatically published by a variety of Debian services, making it
   much easier to work with - for example, one can see who the
   maintainer is and what its issues are.
 * ftpmasters are already far too overloaded looking for problems like
   unredistributability, dfsg-nonfreeness, malformed packages,
   breakages of the archive, etc.
 * It is not ftpmasters' role to determine whether a package is
   RC-buggy; that task is for the Release Team.

I agree that automatic checking is fine, but humans should be able to
override it.  I have no problem with auto-REJECTs, which are generally
either for really serious problems, or can be overridden.
