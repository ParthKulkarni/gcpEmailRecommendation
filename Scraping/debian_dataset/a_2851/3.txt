Err, no.
That number makes the assumption that all users who have something
installed that they don't end up using will be "annoyed".
That's just not correct.
A large amount of users will just select some program in GNOME Software,
and see that stuff is being downloaded. They won't know that there are
multiple packages, just notice that after downloading and installing,
now suddenly they can use that program.
Of those that do know a bit of what happens behind the scenes, many will
not care about what the other packages are. They just know that they're
being installed for some functionality in the software that they asked
for, and will happily allow it to be installed.
Of those that do care, many have more important things to do than to
worry about whether something with an "Installed-Size:" of 716 (!) bytes
does end up on their system.
Of those that do worry, a number may be annoyed, yes. But I suspect that
the number who will be annoyed will be closer to the .1% number you
quote above than the number who will not.
