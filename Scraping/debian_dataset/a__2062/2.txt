Asciinema does, indeed, have a local format, JSON-based:
{
  "command": null,
  "height": 22,
  "title": "demo",
  "duration": 37.608602,
  "stdout": [
    [
      0.061412,
      "\u001b]0;\u0007$ "
    ],
    â€¦
    ]
  ],
  "version": 1,
  "width": 80,
  "env": {
    "SHELL": "/bin/bash",
    "TERM": "xterm-256color"
  }
}
