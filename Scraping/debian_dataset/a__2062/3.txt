  Description     : Terminal I/O recording and playback package.
 tlog is a terminal I/O recording and playback package suitable for
 implementing centralized user session recording. At the moment it is not ready
 for production and is to be considered development preview quality.
 Whereas most other similar packages write the recorded data to a file in their
 own format, or upload it to a custom server, tlog sends it to a logging
 service. The standard syslog interface is supported already, with journald
 possibly to come. The recorded data is encoded in JSON in a way which keeps it
 human-readable and searchable as much as possible.
 - why is this package useful/relevant?
 Fulfills an enormous missing niche in practical systems monitoring and
observation
 on Linux for modern systems.
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
 Packaging is intended to follow upstream closely while the software is in its
 pre-release state. Releases will be automated around CI builds.
