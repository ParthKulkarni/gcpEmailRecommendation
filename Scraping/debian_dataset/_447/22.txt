I received such requests over the past 15 years I've been contributing
to, and later leading the maintenance and evolution of, less-used open
source software.
But you know the breadth of the task, and therefore the time investment
it requires; it's therefore unsurprising that people like David and
myself (as a Debian user for over a decade, but not really familiar with
Debian procedures) aren't eager to subscribe to the tasks of modifying
core aspects of dozens of foreign code bases, and the corresponding
docs, or contacting significant amounts of packagers and upstreams ;)
Thanks for the heads-up about the potential attitude problem, though.

Alright.
Before we can envision reaching such an ambitious, longer-term goal,
we'll collectively have to work on small, achievable goals and tasks...
and whoever does that and follows up on it (yes, I shall spend some time
on the matter) needs help from Debian developers more familiar with
procedures, at the very least :)
For instance, from another sub-thread: for Buster, would it be feasible
to smoothly split the libdb5.3-dependent binaries from libpam-modules,
apt-utils, libaprutil1 (popcon by_inst #423), the Perl and Python
distributions to new binary packages ?

Indeed. In a way, I already started, by spending time writing (partially
redundant, in this case) e-mails about foreign software, rather than
working on code bases more familiar to me, but which have _far_ fewer
users than BDB or earlier and more privately, libmodplug.

Understood, let's do a bit better than that ;)
Thanks,
Lionel.

If there's such a release, I'm afraid Buster won't be it: in less than a
year, the task of providing an upgrade path and deprecating BDB from
every upstream, or removing the corresponding packages from the archive,
looks way too large...
