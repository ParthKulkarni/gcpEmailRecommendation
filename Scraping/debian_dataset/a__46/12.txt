That's just perfect.

That's just perfect. It really sounds like a tool to use if upstream wants to 
provide a non-official Debian package, and believe me that sounds pretty good.
But not for Debian proper, see below.

Well, there are cases when upstream is doing things the right way with respect 
to Debian but... what about derivatives (distributions which base themselves 
in Debian)? Sometimes they need something different, and even if the package 
fits perfectly well in Debian it might not be true for them. So they need to 
either patch CMake files or re do the whole packaging using traditional tools.
That's just an example, but I'm sure other will appear.
To sum it up: I *do* think there is a *huge* potential for this helper, just 
not for Debian proper. Of course I would *love* to see it packaged in Debian 
because it will help projects trying to create their own Debian packages, but 
I would expect a very clear explanation that this is not a suitable way to 
maintain packages in Debian proper.
Except we can find smart work arounds for this cases, of course.
Cheers, Lisandro.
