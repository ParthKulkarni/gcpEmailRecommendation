I say I want people to ask before they do something that my licence
doesn't allow. You want me to have an opinion on another licencing
situation. I don't want to play this game. It'll just end in me asking
probing questions about other people's tea preferences.
Instead, I'll repeat that licenses shouldn't be violated. One way of
achieving that is to ask copyright holders for additional permissions
that are needed to avoid a violation.
I don't like convoluted, controversial re-interpretations of legalese
to achieve Nirvana.
