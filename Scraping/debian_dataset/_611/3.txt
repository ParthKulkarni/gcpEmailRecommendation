I'm trying to install Debian 9.4 on my laptop WITHOUT a "desktop
environment" but giving the default answers to all the other questions.
I figured out how to deal with the lack of ifconfig after the
installation, but trying to find and connect to a wifi network still
produces errors including the phrase "Operation not possible due to
RF-kill."
Various web pages I have read based on this clue seem to imply that
/usr/sbin/rfkill is a normal tool to have installed on a laptop, but it's
not delivered by the netinst process and I don't think it's on CD-1 or
DVD-1 either.
Should task-laptop depend on rfkill?
