There are some best practices for using 3rd party apt repos here:

I don't think this is appropriate at all. Instead, always use an
out-of-band mechanism for confirming the appropriate OpenPGP keys.
Having the keyring package in Debian itself is a good idea, but at
very bare minimum, download the key or fingerprint from a website that
uses a valid TLS certificate according to the X.509 CA trust model.

That seems like a reasonable way to provide a secure mechanism to install it.
