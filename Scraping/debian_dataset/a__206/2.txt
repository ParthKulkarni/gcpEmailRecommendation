That's one way to think about it. Got it, keeping old modules is hard.
But I wasn't asking about keeping old modules, I see no point in this.
I was asking about generating and publishing a matching
dists/testing/main/installer-<arch>/current on kernel upload.
Why is _that_ hard?
I'm asking less of "why isn't it equal to
https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images tree",
and more of "why not d-i stretch rc 2 rebuilt with new kernel".
And https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749991#59
doesn't quite cut it. Triggering is hard? Maybe, why not cron then?
