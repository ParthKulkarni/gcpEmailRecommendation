Hi Laurent,

Great!
Is there any plan to do this up to the point when it's realistic to
enable SELinux by default on Debian? Ideally this would be done early
enough so we can run the s/AppArmor/SELinux/ experiment during the
Buster cycle, and make a decision in time for Buster.
(I'm not counting on LSM stacking being finalized in time for Buster
so for now, if we want a LSM enabled by default, we need to choose
exactly one. I'd be fine with SELinux instead of AppArmor; what would
make me sad is if we remained in the "no LSM" situation much longer
only because we don't manage to pick one.)

That's definitely a risk. If AppArmor ends up being enabled by default
in Debian some day, I think we can easily mitigate this risk by
carefully wording our public communication about it.

I can definitely relate to that feeling and have been frustrated about
this for years. Thankfully things have changed drastically recently:
quite a few features have been upstreamed to Linux mainline in 4.13
and 4.14, and more is upcoming, so I'm now hopeful :)
Cheers,
