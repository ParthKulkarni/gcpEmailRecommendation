Yeah, we really need much more working profiles ready to be shipped...  Thoguh I believe our AppArmor maintainer stated 
opinion that we should fix what's already available, instead of rushing to write bunch of new profiles (please correct 
me if I mistaken, intrigeri :-) ).
As a hint, try running "sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*", it might enable some disabled-by-defaut profiles, as 
Thunderbird and Libreoffice ones.
TBH I'm a bit disappointed with upstream state of Apparmor (no D-Bus mediation,...) and other missing features that are 
still ubuntu only.
Yes I miss features too (not only mediation...). Though Signal and Mount mediation is available in 4.14 (not enabled in 
Debian AppArmor configuration _yet_, until it's tested enough), Network might come in 4.16.
