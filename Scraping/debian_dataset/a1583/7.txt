Hi Anton and list,
with your commit
https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/console-setup/commit/cb7ca79c4e2e81f117a0de7faa90d44ae3b25ec5
all udebs of console-setup were declared as Multi-Arch: foreign
Now lintian claims about "multi-arch" being a unknown field for control files
for all the udeb packages; see
https://lintian.debian.org/full/debian-boot@lists.debian.org.html#console-setup_1.187
So, what's wrong here?
Are udebs not allowed to be multi-arch?
Or is lintian not aware of some kind of rule for multi-arch in udebs?
Unfortunately, the debian-policy still does not contain docs about 
multi-arch fields...
Holger
