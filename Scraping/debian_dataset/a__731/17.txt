Upstreams are going to vary a lot here.  For example, I as upstream would
be happy to bump a version number for a similar problem in Red Hat, since
meh, I don't attach a ton of significance to version numbers anyway as
long as they go up and vaguely follow semver.  (The only thing that would
give me pause is going from a 0.x to a 1.x version number, since that
carries some more semantic weight.)  But I could see some people being
irritated by the request.
I think there's no substitute for knowing upstream and having a feel for
how they'd react.
