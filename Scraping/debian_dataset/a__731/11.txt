1.0.9+bzr1614-1.1 was the last version in the archive.
Not knowing how mature the new elisa project is, strictly speaking this
is a temporay issue until upstream has released a version >= 1.0.10.
When do you expect such a v1 release to happen?
If it's not too far away, you could use the +really notation for the
time being.
Another idea could be to inform upstream of this situation. Maybe they
are willing to bump the version number from say 0.2 to 1.2
