Hello Kumar,
I took a look at your repository on salsa.Â 
Before taking a look at your repository I have also taken a look at some
other repositories on github which had steps for
supporting Ubuntu on the RDP.
Specially this one.
https://github.com/sundarnagarajan/rdp-thinbook-linux
Most of the repositories including yours do handle the issue of getting
custom Debian/Ubuntu installed on Debian with everything working.
And I thank you and others for your work regarding this.
However it does not solve the scenario wherein, if someone has already
installed Debian or any derivative of it, how do I get things working up
there?
In my case I have already installed Hamara Sugam on RDP Thinbook 1130.
By following a few steps from Sundar Nagarajan's repository, I have got
Wi-Fi working.
Sound is not working. Bluetooth works sometimes, sometimes not.
I also tried installing firmware-intel-sound from the firmware-nonfree
package as suggested by Praveen.
But that didn't solved the issue either.
Let me know of a way which can add support to already installed
operating systems on the RDP.
Also in your mail you mentioned about your own repo which would be added
by default on the pre-installed debian systems of RDP.
If I can get the URL of the repo, may be I can get some packages from
there to make things working.
Thanks,
Raju Devidas
