It is in the latest POSIX standard (2008) and appears to have been
specified a long time before that (page says 'Issue 2' which means XPG
Issue 2, dating from the 90s).  Perhaps it assumes that 'type' will be
an external program, but that's not compliant because it must be able
to find shell aliases.  I would consider this a serious bug in posh.
