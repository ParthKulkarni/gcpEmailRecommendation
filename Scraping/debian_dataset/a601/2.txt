Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.89
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
Trying to run debootstrap with just acl (the first package in the list) fails
at unpacking due to a missing xzcat
sudo debootstrap  --merged-usr  --variant=minbase --components=main,non-free
--include=acl jessie /tmp/debtest http://deb.debian.org/debian
I: Chosen extractor for .deb packages: ar
I: Extracting acl...
E: Extracting .//var/cache/apt/archives/acl_2.2.52-2_amd64.deb requires the
xzcat command, which is not available
$ which xzcat
/usr/bin/xzcat
changing /bin/sh -> dash fixes it, but I would have figued that if debootstrap
has its shebang set to /bin/sh, it would work with any posix shell, including
posh.
(I read the warning:
WARNING: Since many of Debian's /bin/sh scripts are not actually policy-
compliant, using posh as your /bin/sh may reveal breakage.)
