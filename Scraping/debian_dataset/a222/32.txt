I think Steffen's point was that all the hideousness you are talking
about was solved in version a.b.c of the software and if version
a.b.(c+1) builds and passes our test suite it will most probably not
have changed.
 
So for packages without lots of rdepends I think the approach to
auto-update is worth some testing ... provided somebody will do the work
to setup such a system which is most probably the cruxial point.  For
instance currently CRAN packages are auto-build - I would not see any
big issues to auto-update r-cran-* packages.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
