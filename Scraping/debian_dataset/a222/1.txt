It's sad, indeed.  But is it a disservice ?
We didn't _make_ the user spend their time debugging it.  They
probably did that because the package was useful enough to them to
warrant it.  That user is probably better off with the package, even
in its unfortunate languishing state, than without it.
The same can go for other users, who probaby prefer a package in
Debian that they may have to apply a patch from the BTS to, to no
package at all.
