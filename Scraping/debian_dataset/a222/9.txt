Yes, in cases where a trivial patch is in the BTS.
But not in the cases where the package is broken beyond repair and

And in general I'd expect from a maintainer that packages are maintained 
not worse than the QA-maintained orphaned packages - for the latter ones 
"easy" incoming bugs are usually handled properly.
