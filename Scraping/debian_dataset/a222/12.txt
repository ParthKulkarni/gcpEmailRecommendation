Yes; and semver.org is a formalized system for version numbering stuff.
If upstream has committed to it (and does not make mistakes), then the c
versions in the above example MUST (in the RFC definition of that word)
only contain bugfixes, and no interface changes.

That's certainly true, regardless of whether upstream uses semantic
versioning.
In other words, this could be a good idea provided that it's not an
automatic thing, and that the maintainer of the package manually jumps
through a few (minor) hoops to make it happen.
