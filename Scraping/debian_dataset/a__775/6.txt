Certainly the right thing to do.
These scripts run as root, that's reaon enough to enforce extra
precautions. I'd consider even stricter modes like set -u, unless ...
Let's be honest: Shell scripts, while easy to write, carry too many
risks of unsafe programming. So while your proposed fixing is a step in
the right direction, this is all just band-aid. We (as in Debian) should
look forward and try to replace these maintainer scripts with something
more error-prone. Niels has mentioned declarative approaches which seem
like a good idea. No idea about the status, though, and I'm interested
in details if there already are some.
