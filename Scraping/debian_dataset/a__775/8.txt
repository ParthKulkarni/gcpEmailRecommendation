systemd provides a facility called systemd-sysusers which allows to
describe system user accounts declaratively. Maybe we could leverage that.

Related to that, there is systemd-preset
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.preset.html
If that would work for Debian is unclear to me.
The common expectation in Debian is, that we expect packages to be
"usable" after installation. Which means we often intermix installation
with configuration, which is typically done via maintainer scripts.
This makes it very hard to disentangle those steps.
