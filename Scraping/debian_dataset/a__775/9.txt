sigh.
And using `#!/bin(ba)?sh -e` is not good either (there is a lintian tag
about it, iirc).

Yes, they are bugs, I agree.

I do agree and support the MBF.  I think they should be at most
severity important, possibly checkig some of those packages (I'm
thinking about samba, samhain, ..) to see whether an eventual failure
would be very bed and in those case even be RC.
Please, as usual, file those bugs using some usertag.
BTW, you forgot to attach a dd-list and a proposed text for review.
