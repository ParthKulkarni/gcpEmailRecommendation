Hello,
we currently deploy LLNG with Fusion-Directory and LSC-Connector to
provide a full IAM solution. See https://fusioniam.org : the project to
package the 3 in one solution (for commercial aspect and to provide
Docker images, the 3 softwares remain separated).
I think that LLNG stable version will not be the best for Debian (2FA
not easy). The next release (2.0) will be release in a few weeks (some
alpha versions are available). It is more complete and the new plugin
system is more interesting to customize it.
