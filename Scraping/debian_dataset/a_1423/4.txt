Sorry about that, I misread you and thought that you thought that there
was only one message.
On closer examination, I think you are correct in saying that the

Perhaps they simply want to waste space in archives?
Not much of a motive/goal, but I get the feeling that the perpetrator
doesn't have much of a life to start with.
