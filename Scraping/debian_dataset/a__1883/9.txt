Yes, that's a drawback we are not hiding. Applications needing Desktop OpenGL 
would be left out. But...

...one thing is running and quite another is: how well does it performs when 
doing 100% CPU-based OpenGL? Are your users *really* interested to use your 
application when all drawing must be CPU-based?

I'm afraid providing two set ups is a non-go (alas, we would be doing that 
already and avoiding all this). And I don't there are many armel/armhf users 
with hardware Desktop OpenGL in their boards.
