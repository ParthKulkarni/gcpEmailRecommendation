So far the worst case of "usrmerge failure" can be fixed by 
deleting/moving some files (that were installed by you) and then running 
the program again. There has never been any case which required 
reinstalling/restoring a system on which the conversion program failed 
and I cannot think of why this could ever be needed.
In other words, you are concerned about failure modes which have never 
happened and that nobody has been able to explain how they may happen in 
the future.

Either they want an enterprise distribution or they want a distribution 
without systemd and merged-/usr, but they cannot have both...
Since merged-/usr makes Debian more similar to enterprise distributions 
it would be a good thing for this kind of customers.
