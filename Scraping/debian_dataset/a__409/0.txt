usrmerge is in the archive for 3+ years now. What seems to be needed now 
is for a lot of us to actually _try_ it, find and report bugs, and get 
this through.
Why, if it was intended as an optional package for people who want 
a merged /usr? If I donâ€™t need or want a merged /usr I wonâ€™t install and 
test the package.
The problem is that people are now talking to forcing the package on 
everyone.
