Causing problems with a few packages is not a significant problem.  We
should stop upgrading GCC to newer versions otherwise as doing so
generates tons of RC bugs every time.

Moving files around in such a matter that they are still available in
the old location (via a symlink) is not a very invasive change, so
there is only a small risk of problems.  That matches what was reported
so far.
Very few changes come with zero problems.

Why should "originally installed in 1993" make moving files from one
location to another more difficult?  It's not different than having to
add LSB init headers to local init scripts (or just replace them with
systemd units these days), having to purge leftover conffiles from
removed packages or similar changes on upgrades.
If the system is prone to breakage on upgrades in general, I would
expect anyone sensible to fix that.
