Yes, this exactly, thank you.  This is a much better description of what I
was seeing as an alternative to the current usrmerge approach, assuming a
(not yet decided) project consensus that we want to do something like
usrmerge in the long run.
This approach will obviously take forever, and be another one of those
Debian transitions that someone five years from now has to do a bunch of
work to finally finish, assuming that happens at all.  But it would be
backward-compatible the entire way.
