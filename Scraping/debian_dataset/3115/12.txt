What about the most basic service, the download page ?
(like <https://alioth.debian.org/frs/?group_id=101016>)
According to 
<https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth#Deprecation_of_Alioth>
there is no equivalent on salsa.
git tags are not a suitable alternative because true release tarballs
include files generated by autotools (among others) that are not in
git, and git tags tarballs are not signed (signed tags is an different
concept).
This unfortunately makes salsa unsuitable as a project homepage.
Cheers,
Bill.
