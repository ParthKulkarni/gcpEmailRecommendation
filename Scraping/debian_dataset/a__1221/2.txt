That's broken, then.
It turns out there was a similar bug against openssh which was closed as 
wontfix [1]. I don't see how apache can do anything about this, either.
But I disagree with the systemd maintainers that there is nothing that systemd 
can do about this. They should credit the entropy loaded from the seed but 
save a new seed immediately after reading it during startup, to avoid that the 
same seed is used more than once.
A second (but  worse) alternative would be to provide something that waits for 
the RNG to be initialized that other services can depend on.
Cheers,
Stefan
