Right, but this raises all kinds of questions like "Is it possible to
improve the ifconfig on Linux to catch up with the BSD version? And
even with ip?". Networking standards and protocols are
platform-independent, maintaining a Unix-wide interface to do the
basic networking stuff sounds like a reasonable thing to do. At this
time ifconfig seems to be the answer, no ip is visible on the BSDs
horizon.
I realize that net-tools version is long gone, but what about the GNU
inetutils one? It's supported and is not Linux-specific. Maybe a new
default implementation of ifconfig should be provided rather than
simply discarding one from a basic install. Another question is
whether you absolutely have to switch to netlink to have a reasonable
ifconfig implementation or ioctl is still acceptable (I don't know).
