this should work as the "real" old Icedove packages uses ~/.icedove and
Thunderbird now uses ~/.thunderbird as default.
But that you probably wont do. You probably want to use Icedove on one
machine and Thunderbird on another machine and you want to use the
profile folder for booth, that will also work if you use versions that
not differ that much. The best would be to only Thunderbird or only
Icedove with the same version.
Combining usage of booth profile folders with symlinking is the thing we
currently talk about to not copy .icedove into .thunderbird.
