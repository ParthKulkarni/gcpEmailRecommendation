I'd be interested in stats of Debian releases, preferred suites, apt
policies and how many bugs were filed from systems running Debian
derivatives, or other distros if any.
BTW, I added a link to this thread in the Debian statistics page:
https://wiki.debian.org/Statistics?action=diff&rev1=162&rev2=163
Are you planning on producing these graphs/stats continuously/automatically?
Got any information on how they were produced?
