Outrageous! apt was always slow to adapt, so the new way of saying one
thing and doing the other isn't fully implemented yet. I am sorry. SCNR

I am not opposed to the possibility of bugs in apt in general, but the
amount of "upgrade with removal"-bugs which all turned out to be either
scrollback-confusion, aliases or wrapper scripts is astonishing, so
triple-double-check this first.
Fun fact: We have a few reports which request "upgrade" to remove
packages. You know, automatically installed packages, obsolete ones or
obviously clear upgrades like exim4 to postfix (or the other way around,
depending on who reports it). I tend to be against that, but in case of
need we could still consider that a feature and close bugsâ€¦ win-win :P

/var/log/apt/history.log* should be able to tell you which commands you
have run and which solutions were applied due to it. That also includes
dates, so you might be able to fish a /var/lib/dpkg/status file from
before the "bad" interaction in /var/backups/dpkg.status.*. Pick the
apt.extended_states* file from around the same date for good measure.
A good idea might also be to write down the result of "grep ^Date
/var/lib/apt/lists/*Release" somewhere to have an easier time of getting
the same mirror state out of snapshot if we need that. Armed with that
you can try debugging on your own as detailed in apts README (in the
source) and/or I would suggest to report a bug with all the details you
collected [and all those the bugscript wants to collect] as its hard to
reproduce otherwise and in general: native tools are offtopic (by thread
popularity) on d-d@ â€¦
â€¦ but let me help you to get the thread some replies: I don't have
ifupdown installed anymore. systemd-networkd + wpa_supplicant FTW.
(also: RC bugs for all node packages failing a cat-picture test!)
Oh, and of course the standard reply: You know, apt does print
a proposal not an EULA â€“ so you don't have to press 'yes' without
reading.
