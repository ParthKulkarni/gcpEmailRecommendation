ok. Let's use the same terminology as debian/copyright. I meant the section 
made of one or more  "Stand-alone License paragraph" [1] . This one was 
missing from the file, the CeCILL license was not defined, hence the file was 
considered as invalid by cme.

You should be able to use paste-license script in you add first the License 
text as a standalone paragraph (using paste-license), *then* add the Files:* 
paragraphs.

It's a corner case because you started from an copyright file that is considred 
invalid by cme because it lacks the standalone license paragraph that defines 
CeCILL license text). 
This challenges the way error tolerance is done in cme, which is not much 
tested yet.
All the best
