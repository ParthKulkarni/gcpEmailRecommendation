Well, OK, when I do not miss the "file=" part I can do
 
$ cme run paste-license  --arg license=CeCILL --arg file=COPYING > copyright.patch

I admit I do not really understand all the output to stderr.  The output
to stdout (in my example redirected to copyright.patch) is

So this does not really help since its neither a valid patch for
d/copyright nor can I add this content there without editing.  It just
added a '+' to the original license text which is not really helpful.
May be I'm continuously missing the point but shouldn't it add rather
a ' ' instead of a '+' and replace empty lines by ' .'?
Kind regards
