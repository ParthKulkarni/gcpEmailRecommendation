That's a bug in cme that will be fixed soon.

Looks like you copyright file already has
Files: *
License: CeCiLL
without the matching section in Licenses (the one you trying to add). cme 
emits a warning when reading a copyright file with this error. This value is 
ignored because of this error.

Likewise.

The new added license is seen as unused because the CeCILL values were ignored 
above. (*)

This is an error shown while writing the file. cme does not accept to write 
back a copyright file containing errors. The values are missing because, err, 
they were ignored above because, err, the main license was missing. 
I guess that error handling in cme can be improved ...

The fact that stdout is redirect makes the errors above harder to understand.

err. it never occurred to me that someone could feed cme output to patch ....

cme should write debian/copyright provided no error is left.
Following Perl's TIMTOWTDI tradition, I suggest to fix this problem by either:
- use -force option with cme and add back the License entries after cme has 
saved the file
- use the GUI (cme edit dpkg-copyright) and cut'n'paste CeCILL license text in 
the License section (see [1] for details)
- tweak your file so that cme check returns no warning before running paste-
license
- fix everything at once with: cme modify dpkg-copyright -force 'License:CeCILL 
text=.file(COPYING) ! Files:"*" License short_name=CeCILL Files:"debian/*" 
License short_name=CeCILL'
Hope this helps

(*) I always wondered if an erroneous value found in a file should be ignored 
or loaded. I've chosen the first option, which leads to the cascading errors 
you've found. I guess that I should implement the second option at least when 
-force option is used.
