As well as that, one could suggest that people add a paragraph about why
they wish the software to be packaged (as a comment that will not appear
in the uploaded package) and/or something about themselves if they're
new to creating packages -- It seems to me that they're more likely to
get useful feedback that way.
Also I suspect that some of the people creating recent ITPs are unaware
that their efforts are going to be forwarded to debian-devel to be read
by thousands, and will also be searchable in the BTS forever with their
name on it (along with any comments provoked -- positive or negative).
Some sort of warning to that effect might make devoting a little more
effort seem worthwhile.
BTW in the case of the node-* packages, I think they're being generated
by 'npm2deb'.
Cheers, Phil.
