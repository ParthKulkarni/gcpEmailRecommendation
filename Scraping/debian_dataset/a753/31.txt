Not sure exactly what the commit was but:
* maybe that person spent time trying to help or trying to fix
something that wasn't clean. Maybe the better way to go is to be
thankful for people trying to help your package being better, even if
expressed not exactly the way you wanted.
* in a community, people trying to help may result in commits that you
will have to revert but I'm not sure why all this fuss. Honestly, I've
made a bunch of MR, some worked fine, some were totally ignored or
just made people angry (for reasons I don't really get), not sure if
it would have changed anything if I would have pushed to master
directly.
* in an even broader sense, it's always a best practice to pull your
repo before working on it and not to keep local changes (at least in
case you are not awake enough and you do `rm -f ~/`+ bad copy/paste
resulting in a wipe of your homedir!)
Maybe we should have kept collab-maint as group name as it says on the
package "Collaborative maintenance"? We can't really change that now!
:)
But anyway, I'm still convinced that playing as a global team is
better than doing something separately and be mad when someone is
trying to help.
