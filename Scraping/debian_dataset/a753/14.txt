Relatedly, what's the etiquette about commits to master? I recently
discovered that someone else had pushed a commit to the tip of master of
one of the packages I maintain (and not notified me); when I complained
I was told that emailing would be too much effort. Am I wrong to feel
that at least a MR is something I should have expected as a package
maintainer, not just commits to master?
[I don't really mean to have a go at the person concerned; I'd just like
to know what to expect in future...]
Regards,
Matthew
