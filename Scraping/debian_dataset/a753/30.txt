Which is exactly the way I managed to notice the request.  Big thanks for
whoever added the !1 -- otherwise it'd wait there ad calendas graecas.
But as you say, it's not enough, and even people who look at DDPO frequently
are going to miss that bit.  Making the !1 stand out is probably not a good
idea, though -- just like bugs tagged +patch, making pull requests sit there
forever (with an ongoing discussion or not), is not that bad.  It's only the
initial notification that's vital.  And for that, the DDPO page is a poor
fit -- it's great for a status overview at a glance, not for timely
notifications.
Meow!
