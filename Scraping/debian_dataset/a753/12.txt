Hello,
Could we document this a little bit better in the wiki? This is
completely different than on alioth, where collab-maint was suggested
for basically everything that did not need a mailinglist.
<https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth/PackagingProject>.
The dda-mail made this difference pretty clear:
| If you create a project within the Debian group, you are implicitly
| welcoming all DDs to contribute directly to the project.
But the wording cannot be copied over directly to the wiki, the
style's off. And I am too stupid right now to convert it. ;-)
cu And- plan for the weekend: move everything except qa away from
        Debian/group - reas
