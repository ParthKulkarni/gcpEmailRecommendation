Apart from the possible linker bug, the Qt5Core part could be solved by adding 
runtime detection. It should not be too complicated to achieve, but:
It should be easy to fix, but we Qt maintainers could not make time for this 
yet, nor we can assure we will. But:
  * In case we get a patch created we want it submitted to upstream, that 
means agreeing with the [CLA]. So if anyone is thinking about creating a patch 
**pretty please** check that you will agree to it. We will not be able to 
forward [any patch], they should be submitted to their gerrit instance by the 
person who coded it. Of course we will be happy to help with the process if 
needed.
[CLA] It's worth to note that this CLA does not makes one give copyright to 
others, but the permission to use the code in proprietary versions.
[any patch] Except the patch is so small that it can't be considered 
copyrighteable.
  * Before applying it we want the patch "blessed" by upstream, meaning that 
even if they don't want to accept it (let's say, just as an example, because 
it's slows loading) they see the patch fit.
Cheers, Lisandro.
