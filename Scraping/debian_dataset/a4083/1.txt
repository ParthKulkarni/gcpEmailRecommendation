Hello,
  This is the result of several days working the issues and analysing
each aspect.  These patches include only what is necessary to support
subvol.  Care has been taken to future proof by preparing for other
filesystems, currently this only works with btrfs.  These patches have
been split, solving four main goals.
1. Scan btrfs filesystems only once, regardless of how many devices they span.
2. Report to the bootloader the existence of OS lurking on subvolumes.
3. Add option to linux-boot-prober for subvolume and output
appropriate rootoptions.
4. Tell bootloader about boot filesystems on a subvolume.
1 is simple and can be applied with no changes to the bootloader.
2 extends the output of os-prober to support subvolumes. Existing
bootloaders should ignore these records as the key was changed from
linux to linux-subvol and the device is listed as device@subvolid.
3 requires the bootloader to be patched to support the above
linux-subvol records.  It should be a noop for bootloaders that don't
pass a subvolid as the second parameter to linux-boot-prober.
4 I would hold off on, it requires the bootloader to support
subvolumes and I think it's ok to restrict the boot device to
non-subvolumes until such support is added.
