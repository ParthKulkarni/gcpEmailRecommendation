OK, that's good.

Actually, that's not your problem. My best guess is that you've done
an installation booted in BIOS mode, not UEFI mode. That's why you've
got grub-pc installed rather than grub-efi-amd64. Do you actually care
about booting via UEFI, or are you just looking for a bootable system?
If the latter, simply reformat your ESP (/dev/sdb1) to be a normal
ext2 or ext3 partition and use that as /boot. You could even do a RAID
/boot using sdb1 and sdc1 together...
