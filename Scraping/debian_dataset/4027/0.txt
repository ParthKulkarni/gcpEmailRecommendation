I guess I'm one of the people you're referring to here. So let me share
my experience:
For cross building I used to consider all of unstable. That turned out
to be painful indeed for exactly the reasons given above. Now I consider
those packages in unstable that have some version in testing and I no
longer have that pain. That seems to be a great filter.
I also performed one feature archive rebuild. Given the number of
temporary failures, I ended up looking at each failure (not just feature
failures) and filing the relevant FTBFS bugs. I regret not having
ignored packages not in testing.
What I found more annoying is packages being removed from unstable that
recently were in testing. I sent patches and the corresponding bugs
where closed by the ftpmaster removal. Not ftpmaster's fault.
Let me draw two conclusions:
 * Maybe we should remove stuff from testing even more aggressively to
   reduce the pain for archive QA?
 * If archive QA gets painful due to broken packages in unstable:
   Ignore those that have no version in testing. It's an easy filter
   with little misclassification.
