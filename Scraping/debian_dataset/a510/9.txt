While waiting for the latest DVD set to arrive, I decided to download 
debian-9.1.0-i386-netinst.iso and write it to a USB flash drive. I then 
used it to install a very minimal system to another USB flash drive 
plugged into the *SAME USB expander*. I specified that Grub be installed 
to the MBR of the destination flash drive.
My hardware, on power on, will repeatably recognize multiple devices 
attached to the expander in a specific order {based on the physical 
location}. The install went normally and it would boot as expected *as 
long as* the source drive was present -- independent of the bios seeing 
the primary hard drive or the flash drive as the boot device. [1]
If only the destination device was present at boot time there were 
multiple scenarios.
If the bios saw the flash device as the boot device *and only if* its 
grub.cfg had had all references to /dev/sdd changed to /dev/sdb, it 
would boot successfully. [2]
The situation is more complicated if the active grub is in the MBR of 
the permanently installed HDD (/dev/sda). I had noticed that running 
update-grub did not always yield a workable menu entry. It's a 
pathological corner case and I did not record the circumstances.
I see the need to perform multiple installs to document exactly what 
factors trigger a failure. Before I run them I need to know what log 
files I should preserve for each case.
[1]  What happens is dependent on whether or not my WiFi hub is attached 
to the USB3 port having priority over the USB2 port into which the port 
expander was attached.
[2]  My WiFi was plugged into the USB3 port during install.
