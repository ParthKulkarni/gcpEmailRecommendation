This has bitten me, and I can't find a work around (ie, it fails every
time).
The attached script ("bug-731859-demo.sh") does a nested debootstrap
run.  The outer run sets up a chroot for the  Debian suite passed on
the command line (eg, "stretch"), then runs a nested debootstrap --
variant=fakechroot in that environment.  For me both these fail:
    ./bug-731859-demo.sh stretch
    ./bug-731859-demo.sh buster
They fail in different ways, but the root cause appears to be the same:
 the ldconfig isn't working.  Note that both leave ldd.REAL and
ldconfig.REAL lying around in the nested run.bug-731859-demo.shsignature.asc
