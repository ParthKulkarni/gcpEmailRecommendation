If his students were doing code archaeology or deep embedded, such areas
require enough base skills that getting spooked by 32 vs 64 bits would be
beyond them.
Less variants -> less confusion -> less pain for the teacher.  There are
architectures where running a 32-bit VM might be a worthy use of your time,
but it's not the case here.

As a lapsed x32 porter, I agree.  But it's still more sensible than i386.
