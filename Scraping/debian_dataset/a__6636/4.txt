How exactly firmware is not software?
We may take a concession and offer non-free or parts of non-free more
prominently (as it's needed on modern x86, all wifi cards I've seen, etc),
but let's not declare that non-software.
Thus, until the situation improves:
* let's make the non-free iso download more obvious
* explain why it's bad.  No quotes from Stallman -- they're opaque to most
  users, quotes from Linus would be better.
On the other hand, there's only 297 non-free packages in Debian, thus I
don't see a benefit in splitting that further.  Most of it is firmware or
docs with unmodifiable parts anyway.
Meow!
