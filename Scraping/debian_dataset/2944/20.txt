I wonder. I estimate about 15% of tests in Debian have never passed.
Obviously they are useless for anything except maybe the careful
maintainer that reads all of them and uses them even when they fail (the
minority I assume). The rest is usable for gating.

In Debian we define regression differently than in Ubuntu. Ubuntu
compares the current result to all the results that were ever obtained.
In Debian we compare to the current status of testing (barring some
implementation details). All the flaky tests remain an issue (and we are
filing bugs¹ for those and ignoring the results² until they are fixed).
245 sounds like an awful lot. Do you know how many of these are flaky?
(This triggers me, I'll check what you have as I love to reuse the
Ubuntu triaging effort and use them in Debian if they apply to Debian).

Debian is doing worse. Current status for unstable (on amd64 only) is
about 80-85%³. testing isn't complete yet, and on top of that the raw
statistics are confusing, because it contains the result of the tests
that prevent migration (for 10 days).

That list (with open bugs) is shorter than I feared as the list that I
started a couple of months ago is already longer⁴. But I expect that to
be merely the effect of you not filing all issues (I don't blame you,
it's a lot of work). I expect Debian maintainers will start to put more
emphasis on passing results, as they now matter *in* Debian.

Fully ack on this though.
