Hi Guillem.
I have no real opinion on this.

Regarding technical aspects like these, one more data point: BTRFS 
meanwhile offers zstandard compression support. So I bet BTRFS 
developers consider it suitable for format stability and long-term data 
storage. I am still using lzo on my BTRFS filesystems, so I can not tell 
any practical experiences so far.

If zstd compressed deb´s appear in the wild, it may make sense to at 
least implement decompression support.
