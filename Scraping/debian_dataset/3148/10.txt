Me neither.  The only comment I have is:  libzstd was first packaged by
the Debian Med team as a predepencency for some biological software.  It
is quite usual that we package predependencies with a limited number of
dependencies even if it reaches out in other fields than life sciences
and medicine.  However, as we have seen recently libzstd seems to become
a basic part of the Debian infrastructure (may be as a result of this
thread sooner or later).  I do not consider packages of this relevance
best maintained by people who usually deal with end user applications of
some specific field.  So please make some suggestion what team should
take over the maintenance - most favourably some place where DDs do not
need to ask for becoming team member to commit some changes.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
