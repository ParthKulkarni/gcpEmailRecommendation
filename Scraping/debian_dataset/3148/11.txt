I've been using zstd on btrfs since half a year before it was mainlined:
there wasn't a single problem that would threaten stability; usual
development woes (alloc/dealloc thrashing, etc) were fixed long before
patches went to -next.
It compresses better than gzip while being faster than lzo, thus there is no
reason to use either if you won't ever use kernels < 4.14 (and, if you ever
compressed a single file with zstd, the incompat flag is set, so you can't
even mount with old kernels anyway).
There is one remaining problem: patch adding zstd support to grub is still
not merged (same as f2fs support, etc...).  This is not a problem for
vmlinuz or initrd (these are compressed already and btrfs backs off from
compressed files very cowardly), but /boot/grub/grub.cfg usually _does_ get
compressed thus you need to prop it off:
find /boot/grub -exec btrfs prop set '{}' compression zlib \;
(properties on newly created files will get copied from parent dir, need to
manually set existing ones)
And yeah, we probably should molest grub's maintainer in Debian...
Meow!
