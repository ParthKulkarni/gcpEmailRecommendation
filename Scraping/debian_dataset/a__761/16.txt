Your explanation definitely helps with understanding the rationale
behind your decision to switch to Google Cloud for some storage. And if
Salsa indeed has I/O problems already, it's much appreciated that you do
something about it. Again, thanks for this.
I just wonder why we don't consider and prefer free solution (either by
running an own external storage or by using free software cloud
providers) over the proprietary ones. In my eyes, this conflicts with
our social contract and with prioritizing Free Software. That's, why I
brought it up here.
What do others think about it?
Cheers
