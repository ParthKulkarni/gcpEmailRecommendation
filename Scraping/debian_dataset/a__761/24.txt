Do you have some abstract for this?  I watched it and still don't know
what you want to say here.

Could you please be more specific on what vendor lock-in you mean?
If I build an application using Kubernetes and Helm, I'm using only free
components, but I'm still locked-in, as there is only one
implementation.  If I do the same using the OpenStack API, I'm locked-in
as there exist only one implementation of this API.
In our case all the components can utilize multiple backends, so we can
freely choose which one to use.  Including completely free alternatives
like ceph with radosgw or minio.

I'm pretty sure all the Cloud vendors do heavy tests on all sorts.  To
be exact, I know they do.  They just don't show you all of it.  So this
is no unique selling point for OpenStack.

No, he just said we should prefer to use free ones.
Endorse is something different, please read yourself

You primarily got more work to do.
