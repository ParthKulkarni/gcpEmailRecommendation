Well, that's an issue as well, but in such case, we don't have a choice.
Unless ... do you know any hard disk manufacturer that are shipping free

I don't think we even tried. I'm convinced that many OpenStack providers
would happily sponsor Debian. There's 18 providers listed on the
OpenStack market place.
Also, numerous times, I offered my help in setting-up an IaaS for
Debian, but it doesn't seem like anyone is interested. I also offered my
help for maintaining Salsa by the way.
