There exists thousand variants how to setup an OpenStack instance.  Just
leave out some specific service and it's not longer compatible with your
project.  So you not just need to find an OpenStack operator, you need
to find an operator who provides the correct set of services you need.

A friend of mine called OpenStack a dysfunctional open source project.
Especially the number of different people giving the shots and running
in different directions does not help.  (No project in OpenStack looks
alike.  Just look at all the different variants for how to maintain the
database schema.)

If you depend on the _interfaces_ they provide.  AWS, at least most
parts of it, is easily replaceable.

No, it's how the word is defined in the english language.
