Hi!
First off, and just to be clear, I think decomissioning Alioth is a
good thing given its current state! Thanks for that.
One concern is whether we'll be needing to mass switch yet again git
repo URLs for the nth time? The nice thing about the current setup is
that it's decoupled from Alioth, at least URL-wise. I think it would
be nice to preserve that.
And the other related concern is that the current candidate (gitlab)
seems to suffer from the same flat-namespace disease as github, where
all users and orgs/groups/teams are conflated, and the site is
user-centric instead of project or team-centered. For something like
gitlab.com or github.com that's from ok to passable (even if sometimes
very annoying), but for something like Debian, where our user
registration is independent of our "forge" this is a problem with
collisions waiting to happen, or where we cannot consider using
groups/teams freely. :( When it seems like most of our packages are
maintained as part of some team even if the team is composed of
very few members, because that's a nice way to group related packages.
I'd like to note that while gitlab, as well as gitea get this wrong,
pagure for example seems to have gotten this right!
Thanks,
Guillem
