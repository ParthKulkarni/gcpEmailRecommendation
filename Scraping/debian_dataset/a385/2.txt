Certainly. ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù was probably too strong. Even with email notifications one could simply not check their email. 
But it‚Äôs as close as we can get to the email workflow that Debian usually operates by, assuming, again, that most people don‚Äôt change their notification settings. 
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one to have missed a merge request for a while thanks to the lack of notifications, but also we don‚Äôt want DDs inboxes flooded with every merge request in the Debian group. 
My concern is that newcomers will have their merge requests ignored when maintainers are not emailed. I see no workable solution as yet, so I‚Äôll have to look more into this and come back to this thread when I find one. 
Thanks,
Jacob
