Can't you do a global update in the gitlab database to replace the old
default value with the new default value ?
I just noticed that we're lacking notifications for most of our packages
in the pkg-security-team and the setup script we used[1] does not include
the IRC URI explicitly so it would have to be fixed first and then I would
have to rerun it on all our repositories.
A simple SQL update query would save us a lot of time. Thank you for
considering it.
Cheers,
