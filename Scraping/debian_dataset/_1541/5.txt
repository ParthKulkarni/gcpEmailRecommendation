Owncloud has been in Debianâ€¦ and its past maintainers gave up on maintaining 
it. For a part of the discussion see:

I think unless there are significant changes in how upstream handles updatesâ€¦ 
orâ€¦ in the way how Debian handles webapps it may be difficult to find a 
maintainer for official Nextcloud Debian packages.
Thank you,
