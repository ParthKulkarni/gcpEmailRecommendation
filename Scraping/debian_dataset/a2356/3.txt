A discussion with Steve suggested looking at when udev updates
/dev/disk/by-uuid - has something changed that stops that directory
being refreshed after partman-base is done (or at least before
bootstrap-base starts)?
I ran some stretch/jessie comparison installs on the following VM system:
  amd64, 1cpu, 1G memory
  sata port 0 - 2G ssd
  sata port 1 - 64M hot-pluggable device
  sata port 2 - 128G hard disk
  netinst preseeded install
None of the disk devices have partition tables at the start.
The partitioning recipe is:
  1 real partition of size 1G for /
  1 real partition of size 127G for an LVM physical volume
  containing all the other partitions.
(It's important to make sure the hard disk is large enough for
 the expert recipe to fit; otherwise the installer defaults to
  1 real partition for /boot
  1 lvm volume named 'root' for everything else
)
What seems to happen on stretch is /dev/disk/by-uuid NEVER EXISTS
during installation in this circumstance. I did see it in other
installation paths I tried.
Right after all the partitioning is complete and debootstrap
is running, /dev/sd* and /dev/disk looks like this:
# ls -l /dev/sd* /dev/disk /dev/disk/by-uuid 2>/dev/null
brw-------    1 root     root        8,   0 Aug  4 07:08 /dev/sda
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  16 Aug  4 07:08 /dev/sdb
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  32 Aug  4 07:08 /dev/sdc
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  33 Aug  4 07:08 /dev/sdc1
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  34 Aug  4 07:08 /dev/sdc2
/dev/disk:
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           140 Aug  4 07:08 by-id
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            80 Aug  4 07:08 by-partuuid
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           140 Aug  4 07:08 by-path
/dev/disk/by-partuuid:
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            10 Aug  4 07:08 d7e0b3f5-01 -> ../../sdc1
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            10 Aug  4 07:08 d7e0b3f5-02 -> ../../sdc2
After installation the system is unbootable because it specifies
  root=/dev/sdc1
in the boot line rather root=UUID=<some-uuid>
The system can be made to boot by and editing the boot line in grub to be
  root=/dev/sda1
In /etc/fstab the / partition is correctly mounted by UUID;
so after hacking the boot line, the system boots correctly.
So it seems that somewhere in grub-installer, the conversion between
device file and UUID is failing and the code is falling back to the
device file.
Strangely, the fstab comment about which device / was on during
installation correctly says it was /dev/sdc1.
Doing the same install with jessie, the boot line is written correctly
using the root=UUID form. I checked and /dev/disk/by-uuid exists by
the time debootstrap is running, but /dev/disk/by-partuuid is never seen.
# ls -l /dev/sd* /dev/disk /dev/disk/by-uuid 2>/dev/null             
brw-------    1 root     root        8,   0 Aug  4 07:54 /dev/sda
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  16 Aug  4 07:54 /dev/sdb
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  32 Aug  4 07:54 /dev/sdc
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  33 Aug  4 07:54 /dev/sdc1
brw-------    1 root     root        8,  34 Aug  4 07:54 /dev/sdc2
/dev/disk:
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           140 Aug  4 07:54 by-id
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            60 Aug  4 07:54 by-uuid
/dev/disk/by-uuid:
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            10 Aug  4 07:54 dc5e366d-94f3-4d8b-82df-df40962bb889 -> ../../sdc1
I hope this is some help with moving this problem forward
