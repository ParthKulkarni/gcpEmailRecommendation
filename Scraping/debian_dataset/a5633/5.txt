Yes, but preferably via dh_installinit (if you also have a corresponding
LSB/sysvinit script, like most daemons) or dh_installsystemd (if not,
like e.g. systemd-cron or quake4-server) rather than directly.

Yes, preferably via dh_installinit or dh_installsystemd.

systemctl daemon-reload is not currently batched. I'm not sure whether
it's suitable for being batched via dpkg triggers, because other packages
that depend on your package are entitled to assume that your service
has been set up before their postinsts run. If it is batched via dpkg
triggers at some point in future, dh_installinit/dh_installsystemd should
always do the currently-recommended thing.
