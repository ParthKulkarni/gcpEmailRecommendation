The image was found under here, but has since been removed:

Well that's not confusing at all. /sarcasm

What's the point in producing testing images if you're not willing to accept bug

before being reported? If no one is supposed to use testing images, perhaps
consider renaming them to "DO NOT USE THIS IMAGE.iso"
