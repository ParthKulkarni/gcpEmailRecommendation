Before we get there, we should first start autoremoving packages from
unstable, if we consider rc-buggy in unstable to be unacceptable. We
do have quite a bit of things in unstable, that are neither getting
fixed, nor getting removed. And are in this limbo state of "no longer
in testing.... no longer in stable.... no longer in old-stable...
still in unstable".
