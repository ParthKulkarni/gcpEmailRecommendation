This would be a fairly-accurate precis of my position.
Indeed, I tend to ACCEPT whilst filing a bug at the same time with
varying degrees of severity through RC-level (#910031, #910656),
normal (#911532) and wishlist (#910029, #910330), etc. etc.

On that note, please suggest additions to the auto-REJECT list as
MRs against dak. It is likely missing many useful tags that have
been added since it was last refreshed.
(As an aside, some tags cannnot be overridden but that's not quite
on-topic hereâ€¦)
