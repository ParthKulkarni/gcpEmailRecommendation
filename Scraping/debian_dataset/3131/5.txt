You can write a script to read apt-avail, parse it as 822, drop all
entries that have an entry with same Package but higher Version.
Not exactly brain surgery, but tedious enough that it should be providen
_somewhere_.  And at least one moron has written exactly that but misplaced
the script somewhere -- one more reason to have the wheel around so no one
needs to reinvent it.
