Upstream often has ways and schedules for their software that just 
happen to differ from how and when Debian does things.
"self-baked" might just be the normal upstream way of installing the 
software.
In the best case uptream provides a container containing everything the 
software needs.

In some cases this might require changing literally thousands of 
packages in stable.
Imagine said upstream version requires the latest Node.js.
Various other packages in stable won't work with the latest Node.js
and will also require upgrading.
In the Node.js ecosystem it is par for the course when upgrading
a package breaks countless reverse dependencies.
And all this automatically deployed via unattended-upgrades to
millions of machines running Debian stable.
