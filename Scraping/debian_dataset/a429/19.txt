I think we need to handle cases like this,
https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-state-machines
ruby-state-machines and ruby-state-machines-activemodel should go
together and even when autopkgtest for the version is unstable passed,
instead of reducing the age, it is considered a regression because
autopkgtest for the version in testing failed and age is increased.
I think in cases where version differs in testing and unstable,
regression in testing should not delay migration.
