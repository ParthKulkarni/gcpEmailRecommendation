Isn't this a sign that ruby-state-machines has broken API, and should gain
"Breaks: ruby-state-machines-activemodel (<< 0.5)" or similar before it
migrates to testing? If so, then the autopkgtest is doing its job: it
has found a bug.
If packages in unstable "should go together" then you need to tell
apt that, otherwise it will assume that arbitrary partial upgrades are
a valid solution. Testing migration uses the same metadata.
