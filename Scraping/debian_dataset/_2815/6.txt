I think that is a good idea, but reading the code I'm not quite sure
where the reported problem comes from.
netcfg installs rdnssd when an IPv6 router advertisement with RDNSS
(recursive DNS nameservers) is found during installation. Tasks
generally only recommend network-manager(-gnome) as far as I can tell,
so the conflict will keep rdnssd installed and network-manager uninstalled.
However the code in finish-install.d/55netcfg-copy-config only mangles
/e/n/i if network-manager is really there, so in this particular case
Paul should have ended up with a traditional /e/n/i and ifupdown.
@Paul: Can you share the installer log (/var/log/installer/syslog) and
the content of your /etc/network/interfaces after installation? I'll try
to get that information myself tonight, I don't have RDNSS here in the
office network unfortunately.
