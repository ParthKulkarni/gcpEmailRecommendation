Stepping back a bit I think the ideal situation is this:
 * All packages have sysvinit scripts for compatibility.
 * Some packages have metadata for additional init systems,
   including systemd and/or runit.
 * When runit-INITSYSTEM is installed (where INITSYSTEM is sysvinit or
   systemd), and a package is installed that provides runit metadata,
   the daemon is run via runit.
 * When runit-init is installed, obviously, the runit metadata is
   used for packages that provide runit metadata.
 * Packages might provide `sysvinit scripts' which actually work
   via runit, and Depend on runit (but not runit-init).  That is fine
   since they will work with all init systems.

I think some of this should be done by runit-INITSYSTEM packages too,
since in those cases the daemon should be run via runit and all the
things should be set up.

It might be worth doing this as a dh_* command.  It is generally
better to do these things at build time where a greater variety of
tooling is available, and debugging is easier, than shipping input
files to be converted on end user systems.
Cf the emacsen compilation stuff, which I was just debugging a
package's interaction with yesterday.  I understand why it is that way
and I don't want to change it, but we should avoid that approach where
we can.
