Not in Debian.
The Debian philosophy in this has always been to link against all
libraries where possible, and to detect at runtime whether something can
be used. This introduces a much larger dependency tree, but ends up
being easier to use for most users.
The alternative is something like Gentoo, where you *can* decide what
you compile in and what you don't. The trouble with Gentoo, however, is
that you spend seven hours installing it, and then your mouse doesn't
work because you set one USE flag incorrectly and now you have to
recompile the universe (I exaggerate, but you get the point).

That's a great way to introduce a large set of bugs of the "oops, tried
to use libX when dlopen failed for some reason" type. It's better to
avoid that issue by just having a hard dependency on the library in
question.
