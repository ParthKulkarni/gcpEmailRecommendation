These two files are to be used together like this:
Fetch the Release/Release.gpg files (or InRelease).
Verify the OpenPGP signature.
Use the metadata in the Release file.
Get the path to the installer hash files from the Release file.
Download the installer hash files.
Verify the hash in the Release file matches the installer hash files.
Download the installer files you're interested in.
Verify the hash in the installer hash files matches the installer files.
If you had apt available to you, I think it could be made to do some
parts of this for you based solely on the sources.list file.
The other thing is that we generally don't expose the files you are
looking at to users, we generally recommend folks use the netinst ISO,
which is on another server altogether:
https://www.debian.org/
https://www.debian.org/distrib/
https://www.debian.org/CD/
https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso
