I don't think this is OK.  Patch files committed to native packages tend
to bitrot quite quickly because there's little in the way of tooling to
support them, so instead of a three-minute merge job (seriously, I've
done this a lot and with practice that's what it is) suddenly it's a
longer and much less predictable/automatable job of figuring out what's
gone wrong with the patch and fixing it up.  Not a great tradeoff.
It's also actively worse in the long run to have the Ubuntu translations
*added* to the Debian translations as you've done, rather than being
in-place modifications.  This means that Ubuntu translations will fail
to pick up corrections to the Debian translations: even in a string as
simple as this, that can and does happen.

I don't think that's a fair request to make of Debian translators, which
is why I never made it in over ten years of carrying forward this patch.
I'm not going to close this with my Ubuntu hat on, but I think that d-i
folks should decline this patch.  For the reasons given above, it's
worse for both Debian and Ubuntu.
