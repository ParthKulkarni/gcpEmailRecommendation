Has this option been given enough attention?  It sounds appealing in
two ways: 1. it would work as an incentive for people who want to
install usrmerge (be it because they are curious about the results or
because they wish to help), but are not in a mood to reinstall their
systems *if* the merge causes trouble; 2. it would serve as a place to
collect the feedback and summarize the potential problems.
Maybe I'm just asking because I'm one of those not in a mood to
reinstall, but it does sound appealing to me.
