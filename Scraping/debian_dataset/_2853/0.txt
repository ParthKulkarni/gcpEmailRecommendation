(please reply on debian-devel unless your reply is very specific to one
of the other teams)
Hi all,
I wanted to share this discussion with the wider community as Kanboard
has appeared in two different teams (DebConf and Outreach) and it also
relates to (or potentially duplicates) the functionality of other tools
like the BTS or the RT system used by DSA...

Duplication of effort in maintaining these things could be an issue.
Does the issue tracker in Gitlab duplicate the BTS functionality?  That
could be a reason not to enable it and simply run Kanboard for
activities that don't really intersect with the BTS content.
On the other hand, in the Outreach world (GSoC and Outreachy), there may
be cases where an intern is working on some issues tracked in the BTS as
well as some standalone issues.  For example, on Renata's board[2], we
create tasks for small things like asking for feedback from the Moin-dev
mailing list, that isn't a task that would go in the BTS.
Another possibility: DSA already run RT and there is a Kanban
extension[3] for it.
As mentioned in my blog recently, I would also like to encourage a
student to develop a GUI that can interface to multiple[4] issue
trackers (BTS, RT, etc) and aggregate the issues in a single Kanban view
on the desktop.
Regards,
Daniel
