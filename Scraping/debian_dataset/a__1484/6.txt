Oy vey... I didn't notice this when Ralf's mail was posted (merely
checked whether I'm or QA are on the dd-list).  But, indeed, this whole
MBF is wrong.  Thanks Wouter!
The rarer case of silencing both stdout and stderr tends to be written:
    foo >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
-- or at least I've been taught so, as this doesn't look like the common
case.  Ie:
    foo 2>&1 /dev/null
which you somehow have a problem with.  Don't you use this very construct
every a few days?
Meow!
