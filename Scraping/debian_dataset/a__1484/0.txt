Not wrong, just having the potential for false positives.
A cursory inspection using codesearch showed me 43 examples that where the 
redirections are wrong and only 1 example where the script was actually 
trying to capture stderr. (The code used by Ralf to find these picks up many 
more examples than my simple grep will pick up.)
It may also be that Ralf and his team are already filtering out places where 
the output is captured; the talk by Ralf and Nicholas at DebConf is well 
worth watching.

Not restricting the search to maintainer scripts finds many many more... 
it's a common enough mistake.

Stuart
