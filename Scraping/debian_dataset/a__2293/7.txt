I personally did it since you can save a lot of syntax things like "; \"
at end of lines etc.  I would not make it a common rule but I became
simply used to it.

The argument of the bug report was that dh does not know the target.
Since d/rules is usually interpretet by dh I understand the arguing
to not describe something that can not be interpreted by dh.

Yes.

That is exactly what I wanted to express.  I do not mind the actual
implementation but writing down in policy that there should be some
common interface to obtain the upstream source as a fallback to uscan
(and only as fallback if there is really no chance to use uscan) seems
important to me,
A wording that makes bug reports of high severity possible saying:
   Package is using get-orig-source instead of uscan
is fine for me. 
Kind regards
       Andreas.
