I did it for gcc-4.9, which basically boils down to:

The filterdiff is needed to filter out the GFDL documentation hunks.
Using parallel build (-jX) fails for us, so it takes ~13h to compile
that gcc. I was told to use '-J' instead, but that is not supported by
dpkg-buildpackage in Debian-Stretch :-(
After that just re-compile your Linux kernel.
It hoefully will have

That worked for us here at Univention.
