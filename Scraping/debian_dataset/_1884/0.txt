This sounds ok.

I've built it using:
 sudo lwr -t "live-task-base live-task-localisation gnustep gnustep-games gnustep-examples gnustep-devel avahi-daemon libnss-mdns eject alsa-utils xorg xserver-xorg-video-all xserver-xorg-input-all desktop-base xdg-utils"
...which are the packages you included in the patch + the packages task-desktop depends on and recommends. One of these will be installing the menu entries.
