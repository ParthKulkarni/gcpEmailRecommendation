You seem to be confused:
 - stretch/updates is a security suite.
 - stretch-proposed-updates is what this stretch-pu request is about;
   the package is available in this extra suite which users may have
   configured, then merged during point releases into stretch.
 - stretch-updates is for immediate bug fixes, through an extra suite as
   well, even if it's more likely to be configured on user systems.
I haven't seen anything in the bug report that indicates you were
requesting that your package goes to stretch-updates as opposed to the
default stretch-proposed-updates, so your claim above seems rather
incorrect to me.
