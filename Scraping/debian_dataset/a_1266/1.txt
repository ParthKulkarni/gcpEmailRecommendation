The descriptions for that are hardcoded in lib/Packages/Sections.pm,
you might want to submit an update for the master branch of that too.
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/webwml/packages.git
I've updated the wiki page to mention this:
https://wiki.debian.org/NewArchiveSections?action=diff&rev2=6&rev1=4
> https://packages.debian.org/sid/rustc , as well as to the Packages file?
There doesn't appear to be any section info on that page.
The Packages file has already been updated:
$ apt-cache showsrc rustc | grep Section
Section: rust
