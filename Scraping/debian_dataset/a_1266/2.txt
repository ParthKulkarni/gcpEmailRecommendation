As of today, all of the bugs in still-maintained packages have gotten
fixed: aptitude, lintian, packagekit, reportbug, synaptic, vim, neovim,
zsh, libconfig-model-dpkg-perl, and gambas3.  All of those appear well
on track to make it into testing before the freeze.
dl10n and dpkg-www haven't updated, but they don't appear maintained,
and them lacking a couple of sections will not lead to any significant
issue.
Given that, can you please go ahead and add the two new sections for
rust (https://bugs.debian.org/845576) and javascript
(https://bugs.debian.org/753480), and update the override file for
existing packages?  These packages should move to the "rust" section:
rustc, cargo, libstd-rust*, and rust-*.  And all packages named
node-*, libjs-*, and javascript-* should move to the "javascript"
section.
Thanks,
Josh Triplett
