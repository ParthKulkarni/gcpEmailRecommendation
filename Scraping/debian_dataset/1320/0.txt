Aside from `git debcherry`, which was already mentioned, git itself can
get you this information.  For example:
    git log --oneline 1.2.3..debian/1.2.3-1 -- . ':!debian'
This will get you all commits which touched the upstream source that
have not been merged upstream.  There can be as many merge commits as
you like in between.

This is probably why we disagree :)
