Why Recommend rather than Depend?  The latter would allow a hard conflict
with everything with a specific kind of badness, which seems exactly like
the thing people here are looking for.
Thus, if I want for example to be free of AGPL (which for some reason is
allowed in main despite being neither Four Freedoms nor DFSG free), I ban
nonfree-agpl and there's no way it can sneak back in.
