Then they can stay in non-free along with all the other things under a
non-free license.  We had a project-wide decision more than a decade ago
that the DFSG applies to *everything* in main, not just source code.

Among many other reasons:
- Copying bits of the standard into your code, your comments, or your
  documentation.
- Using a grammar out of the standard to write a parser and/or lexer.
- Parsing interesting bits of the standard to do automatic code
  generation.
- Rendering the standard in a better format.
- Using the standard as the basis for a presentation explaining how it
  works.
- Using the standard as the basis to write another, better standard.
- Using the standard to write a completely different standard that
  incorporates it, in whole or in part.
To pre-answer one of the most common objections to the ability to
modify:
The ability to create a modified version of, say, the deflate RFC does
not in any way change the actual standard for deflate, any more than the
ability to modify zlib creates a new "official" zlib.  You can create
your own version, and label it appropriately; the official version
remains the official version.  Changing a standards document doesn't
change the standard.
This really comes down to a question of endorsement: we determine
whether a standards document represents the "official" version by
looking at whether it has the endorsement of a particular standards
body.
