(Adding Ian Campbell.)
Ok, I didn't notice the version of u-boot from the log you posted and
went on what you wrote.
However, looking at the log file again, I notice you're loading the
DTB file separately.
You say you follow my installation instructions but clearly you're
not.  In Debian installer, for the various plug devices, we append to
the DTB at the end of the kernel rather than loading it separately.
Can you please follow the instructions at
https://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/install/ and post
the output of that?
