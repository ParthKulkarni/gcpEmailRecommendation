I've queued now a commit for dpkg marking the spec as stable. So, for
all practical effects, feel free to consider it as such from now on.
But if there were still serious concerns, please bring them up before
dpkg 1.19.1 hits unstable in a couple of weeks at most, when we'll
consider it really really stable. ;)
Thanks,
