Hi,
While there has not been any comments / feedback on devel-devel, we have
seen about 35-40 packages adopting R³ since the proposal was posted to
debian-devel. :)
  This puts us on about ~50 packages that can now build without
(fake)root today (per [codesearch query]).
 * Please consider taking R³ for a spin and see if it works for your
   packages.
 * Thanks to Simon McVittie (#880095), dh_girepository now supports
   R³=no builds (available both in unstable and testing).
 * If your package is (bit-for-bit) reproducible, then the checksum will
   generally remain the same when you adopt R³ (assuming you fixate
   package version, build-dependencies, etc.).
 * Even when you do not have/get a bit-for-bit reproducible output,
   there is always diffoscope to tell you what changed.
Thanks,
~Niels
PS: Thanks to codesearch.d.n for making a (mostly) "silent adoption"
visible!

NB: There are 5 unique packages in the "per package view".  Currently,
dpkg is still "opt'ing out" but is expected to opt-in on the 1.19.1 upload.
