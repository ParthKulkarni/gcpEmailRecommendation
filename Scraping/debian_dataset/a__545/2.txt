  I'd strongly urge you to reconsider packaging this project, for
 three main reasons:
  * It relies upon the external VPNGate.net site/service.  If this
    goes away in the lifetime of a stable Debian release users will
    be screwed.
  * It allows security attacks against the local system, which other
    users on the host could exploit via symlink attacks on /tmp/openvpnconf
  * It allows security attacks on against the local system which the
    remote service could exploit:
    1.  The tool downloads a remote URL to /tmp/openvpnconf
    2.  The file is then given as an argument to the command:
            sudo openvpn /tmp/openvpnconf
    3.  That generated/downloaded openvpn configuration file could
       be written to do anything, up to and including `rm -rf /`.

  Finally the project itself notes:
    "This is completely insecure. Please do not use this for anything
    important. Get a real and secure VPN. This is mostly a fun tool to
    get a VPN for a few minutes."
