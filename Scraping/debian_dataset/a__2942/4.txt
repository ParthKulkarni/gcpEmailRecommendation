Dear all,
I *think* a bit of context is missing here. My wishlist bug was in
relation with #866629 which has to do with installing the live CD
without a network present. There have been other bugs before (which I
can't remember) where not having network access had bugs. Not the same
or similar kind of bugs but if needed can dig out, only will take time
as I'm ill. These were of earlier releases and I *think* there would
be bugs of such nature simply because the no network/intermittent
access scenario might not be tested enough by most devs/ testers .
This is and would be a reality in India and I guess many of the
developing countries for a long time to come except for some *rich*
areas.
Now as happened in the bug shared, at a glance it isn't easy to know
if it's a live installer, network install or a regular image. If it
had an image stating it's a live CD I would not have made the mistake
while adding info. on the bug-report.
There is another scenario to consider, people making videos would
probably also prefer if there are slight differences in the UI to
accentuate the differences in the install and output it has.
Lastly, I have seen and observed many newbies (specific to India)
getting confused as well between the different installation scenarios
as well. Having a distinct label while installing Debian would help
clear the confusion.
I do hope I have given enough reasons for the change to be warranted.
I am open to discussion if my views are unfounded in any manner.
