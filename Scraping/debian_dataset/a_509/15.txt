Thanks, Sean.
For others: this was prompted by a conversation Sean and I had in a
pub on Monday.
Before we get into a detailed discussion here on -devel I think it
would be worth Sean and me getting the DEP draft into some kind of
reasonable shape that we both agree on.
So I won't reply in detail to the comments.
Ian.
