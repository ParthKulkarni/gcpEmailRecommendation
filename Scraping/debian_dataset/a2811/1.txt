OK, in the meantime I found official Debian apache2 git repo:
https://salsa.debian.org/apache-team/apache2
But the patch from bee2facd9343beda10677b139cd9b2e49e986f01 (https://salsa.debian.org/apache-team/apache2/commit/bee2facd9343beda10677b139cd9b2e49e986f01) was already applied to latest apache2 package in Debian 9.6 (modules/http2/h2_bucket_beam.c). How come this should fix the problem? Or did you rather mean this patch is the source of these issues.
Best,
Philip
