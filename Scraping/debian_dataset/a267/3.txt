I just retested it and you're right, I misremembered. It works
when I press <Esc> in the installer and then enter the correct
"console" settings, but not immediately without having access to
the VGA output.
Then please consider this a feature request. It would be awesome
if the installer could be booted over serial without needing any
graphical output.
