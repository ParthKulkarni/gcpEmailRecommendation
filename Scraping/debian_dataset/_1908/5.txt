For the record; It is a known issue documented on
https://www.debian.org/devel/testing.en.html

(Out of dateness note: We now use i386 AND amd64 as minimum requirement
instead of only i386).
The problem with undoing this gross hack is replacing it with something
that "just works" without (too much) manual hand-holding and does not
allow "obvious regressions" to migrate.  For those who are interested in
working on such a patch, my notes on the area are the following:
"""

"""
(caveat emptor: My notes might not be the canonical source of truth for
this problem)
