It certainly makes sense for debootstrap to create those files given it
creates the symlinks in the first place.
An alternative solution could be to reuse the usrmerge package and let
debootstrap install this package if it exists. That way the usrmerge
package would exist until Debian switched entirely to put everything into
/usr/bin.

Ack.

Note that the change in debootstrap does not install usrmerge currently.
It only creates the required symlinks.
<reminder>
But this is enough to confuse "dpkg -S". This used to break dpkg-shlibdeps
and was the main reason for the initial revert. Fortunately dpkg-shlibdeps has
been fixed to try multiple paths until it can find the package owning the
library.
</reminder>
It might be that we will find other tools confused by "dpkg -S" non-answer
on some /lib/* or /usr/lib/* paths and some end users will definitely be surprised by
this.
Obviously we can document the problem in release notes but it would be
better to have a clean solution like suggested by Guillem:

If this is forthcoming in the buster timeframe, it seems reasonable to
go ahead and re-enable the merged-usr by default. However to be able to
ship the new configuration files once their format is known, it would be
better for debootstrap to install a package whose role will be to provide
those configuration files ASAP after dpkg starts to support them.

Forbid those options there? Do not parse those files if you detect
an environment variable DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION?

That's the whole point of it so I would not consider this a problem.

Are you considering both "usrmerge" and "debootstrap creating symlinks" as
hacks even once they would provide mapping data for dpkg --search?
I believe that we have had quite some testing already last time and I
would be surprised if we got many more RC bugs on dpkg that had to be fixed
on a short timeframe. I guess nobody can give you any assurance but
I'm sure that you can downgrade those bugs pointing to this discussion
and showing that this was part of the deal.
