Something I did notice yesterday by accident is that ldd points to
libraries being loaded from /lib. Which is fine except that then you
can't put them into dpkg -S because dpkg does not know about the
aliasing that happens here. I suppose this is because /lib/* is listed
before /usr/lib/* in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*-linux-gnu.conf. I suppose if
one wants to use the output to find the packages associated, one needs
to roundtrip through realpath once. But then again you might miss files
actually installed by dpkg into /lib.
So I think the question of "is there buy-in from the dpkg maintainers to
support the outcome" is not a bad one. ;-)
Kind regards
