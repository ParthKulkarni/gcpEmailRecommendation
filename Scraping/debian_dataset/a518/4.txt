But that doesn't need a separate area to push this with special
restrictions for who can push there: this can just be done into
a separate branch in the repository by the people who already
have access to said repository. And from a maintainer point of
view: it's far simpler for me to simply do a push to the actual
packaging repository of a new branch than to push to a new
remote specifically created for this.
If you want to standardize this a bit, why not update DEP14 then
to include recommendations for how these kinds of branches should
be named? Even though I do think this is going to be a rather
rare situation, I can see the merit of having a recommended
convention for this. But that would fit far better into DEP14
IMHO.
But I still fail to see any advantage of the technical solution
you suggested in the start of the thread, with all the permission
checks and so on.
