Dear all,
I am hereby reserving DEP number 15 for my draft DEP, "Reserved
namespaces for DD-approved non-maintainer changes".
I'd like to suggest discussing this DEP on d-devel (which is the
Reply-to for this e-mail).  The canonical DEP text is at
<http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep15/>.
The drivers are myself and Ian Jackson, who came up with the idea, but I
said I'd write up the formal proposal.
