As Scott is not "officially" speaking from the FTP team but just as a
DD, I'll chime in here.
I think the package name should indicate the field for which it is
meant (freebayes-genetic-variance), but I don't think the program name
should deviate from upstream; we have had issues such as when node.js
was introduced (that 'node' was a name already taken by another
program), but I don't think 'freebayes' will be such a contentious
program name.
