Clearly the answer of unattended-upgrades or not is situation
dependent and the solution should depend on who is running Debian in
what context.
Desktop users should get whatever UI is available for the particular
desktop that is installed that installs upgrades on shutdown and
suggests upgrades when available.
Cloud users should get unattended-upgrades by default.
etc
