Sure. But what Paul mentioned "at very bare minimum". That is, better
options are available, but it's easy to do better than
"--allow-unauthenticated" and that should really not be encouraged.
I agree that having a key fingerprint on a valid TLS website is less
good than having a trust anchor in Debian, but it is much better than to
just install any random key with --allow-unauthenticated, or something
similar.
