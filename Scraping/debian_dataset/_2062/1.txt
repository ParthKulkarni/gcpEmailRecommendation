Yay, yet another incompatible format.
For example, my termrec can convert between ttyrec, nh-recorder,
dosrecorder, RealLogs -- and I bothered to implement only formats that see
some use in the wild (which excludes eg. script -t, whose two-file
unhandiness means no one uses it despite coming in an essential package).
I haven't looked if Asciinema grown a local format when I wasn't looking,
either.
For example Nethack and Crawl communities have long since standardized on
.ttyrec.bz2 (which means a convenient player must handle compression
transparently).  There's also a bunch of players which can handle ttyrecs:
"ttyrec", termrec, three Perl thingies, ttyplayer, ipbt.
As for remote services, there's termcast, Asciinema and others.
Meow!
