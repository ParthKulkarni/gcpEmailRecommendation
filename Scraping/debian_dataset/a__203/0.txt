I'm not disputing that, and that's why I mentioned in my first reply
that I called for help so that others give a hand and get a new upstream
packaged.

With a newer sed (that is: including the fix you linked to), sed -i
would fail because of a missing file to work on, and would have broken
the installation process instead of generating a file with strange
permissions. That's why I mentioned we need to guard the sed call with a
test on its existence. In other words, the fix pushed for #854924 was
needed either way.
