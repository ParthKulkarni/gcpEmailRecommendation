Hi Mario,
first of all thanks for your pointers!

So I suppose mirroring would entail fetching the firmware.xml.gz from 
LVFS' CDN and then downloading and rewriting the release locations - 
plus dealing with signing the metadata. That seems fairly straightforward.
If there would be a way to check the provenance of an updater package 
(i.e. not just rely on arbitrary vendor authentication on the backend), 
that'd still be nice.
(Plus percentage-based rollouts, but that's just yet another feature 
request. :)
Thanks, I found a note on [1] and if it's indeed per remote, it should 
be fairly easy to manage.
I cannot tell you how happy this makes me. This is awesome. Thank you 
(and everyone else who contributed to this effort) for doing the right 
thing! And obviously kudos to Dell for staffing this.
The plugin library seems to be on [2] and there's a sizable set of them. 
Even an AMT updater. :o
