Something I think worth mentioning is that LVFS is being transitioned to being run
and managed by the Linux Foundation.

Speaking on behalf of one of the biggest distributors of firmware on LVFS (Dell)
I can say that all of the firmware images are signed by Dell PKI infrastructure and
will not flash on the system if modified.
LVFS is currently in the process of plumbing this information through to the U/I
as well.

LVFS is able to prevent distributing updates in two situations:
1) when there are known bad SW combinations (say vendor knew bug existed in fwupd
1.0.x but was fixed in 1.1.x - set minimum version for the update to be 1.1.x).
or need to update device XYZ before device ABC.
2) rate limiting of updates
To stage rollouts and monitor optional feedback in the event of a problem.

Please keep in mind it's much much more than EFI updates now too.  There are updates
that can apply "in Debian" without a reboot for things like Thunderbolt controllers, docks, 
MST hubs, and various USB devices.
