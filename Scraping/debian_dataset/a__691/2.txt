Thank you for pointing out !
The pkg-javascript team is working hard to bring to Debian or keep within Debian useful tools such as gitlab, etherpad, buildbot 1.x and signal-desktop (that's an electron app).
Here I only listed stuff that is already worked on.
More useful stuff keeps coming out from the javascript ecosystem, the latest that I stumbled upon is scuttlebutt referenced here:

The number of tiny node-* packages required is indeed staggering.
