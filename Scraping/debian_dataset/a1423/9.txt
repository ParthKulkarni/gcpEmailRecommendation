As previously mentioned, it's configurable behavior of dch (which I don't
use anyway), so we can both be happy.  (I don't use dch anyway.)
Having to repeat the build and test cycle one last time when I'm ready to
upload is a *feature*, as far as I'm concerned, not a bug.  I use that
intentionally.
I'm pretty happy with the current workflow, so as long as no one breaks
it, I don't really have any worries.  :)  I have a mild preference against
messing about with it, since it already works for me, but if that happens,
I suppose I'll figure it out.
