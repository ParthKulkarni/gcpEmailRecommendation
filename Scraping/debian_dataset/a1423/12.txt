Even if a VCS is used, the branch name may fail to indicate the suite.
"refs/heads/tmp.for-guido" doesn't say "I mean this for experimental".
(And of course not all VCSs do branches the same way.)
It is the very contents of the tree (ie, its actual source code
contents) that mean it is suitable for a particular suite.  The
metadata that indicates this to the tools should be in-tree too.

See above for why the suite needs to name the real suite.  We could
decorate the suite instead, but that does not have any effect on
generated binaries.  As I say, the unfinalised version of the package
should generate binaries with non-release versions.
