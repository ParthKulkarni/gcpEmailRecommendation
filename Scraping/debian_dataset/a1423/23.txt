No, at worst you upload to unstable something that ought to have gone
to experimental, because the tooling failed to notice your mistake.
If you had been able to note somehow in the relevant vcs branch that
it was intended for experimental, you have a much better chance of
having done so - and the tools would then be able to catch it.

There's two meanings of "finalised" then.
One is "contains name, email address, and date of purported decision
to upload".  (Let's call that "with trailer" from now on.)
The other meaning is "has been updated to reflect decision to upload,
including recording name and email of the person making that decison
and the time they did so".  (Let's call that "upload decided".)
I think that recording a false or dummy set of information about a
purported upload decision is a silly way of recording the fact that
the upload decision has not, in fact, been taken.
I think tools and people only do it this way because some other tools
have been grumpy about changelogs without trailers.  This is also
silly, since they're all our tools and we could just fix them.

That's not true.  I would like to know, for example, whether the
version of sysvinit I have running on my laptop is the version I
finally uploaded to sid, or some pre-release which might not be
identical to sid's.
