DEP14 allows for branching schemes that have the desired suite included
like debian/sid, debian/experimental, debian/stretch so the information
is included in the VCS and UNRELEASED only indicates the "not finished
yet" part.

gbp dch adds a ~<N>.gbp<M> by default. N being the snapshot number (the
nth time you ran dbp dch since the last release) and <M> being the first
digits of the sha1. This allows for
   * easy identification of snapshot builds
   * increasing version numbers useful for e.g. CI builds.
   * a version number that is smaller than the final release number
     so systems having snapshot builds can be easily upgraded to
     release versions
   * a mapping back to the git commit until when the changelog was
     filled.
