+1.  I think firmware is something conceptually different than non-free
software in general, and it would be good to give users a simple way to
choose to enable non-free firmware without enabling other non-free
software.
For the discoverability, I would be quite comfortable with putting both
the free and the non-free download links prominantly on the page with the
non-free link going to or closely tied with a page that discusses the
issues, explains why we have this installer even though we don't really
want to, and maybe links to the FSF Respects Your Freedom pages to suggest
a hardware alternative.
