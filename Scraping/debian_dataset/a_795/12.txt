Ie, we'd have a Packages file for non-free and another for
non-free/kitten-images with the very same debs?
There's no file duplication as these days we have a shared pool/, and
if someone enables both, it's no different from having both unstable and
buster (which share 99% files), handled well by user tools.
No distruption for existing systems, satisfies those concerned about
accidentally installing "real" software (as much as the notion of executable
code running on another processor in your machine, or even deeper inside the
same processor, being less of software, is ridiculous to me).
Me likes.
