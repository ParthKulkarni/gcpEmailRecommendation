Is the following scenario a concern that we should take into consideration?
 - a core library that python3.5-minimal (or libpython3.5-minimal) depends
   on has an ABI change and must be renamed, with a conflicts on the old
   package name.
 - new python-minimal is unpacked. /usr/bin/python is a dangling symlink.
 - python3.5-minimal is removed due to the conflict.
 - python3.6-minimal is not yet unpacked, because ordering is not
   guaranteed.
 - python3-foo module is removed due to another conflict.  The prerm fails
   because py3clean can find no version of python3 interpreter on the disk.
The pre-depends would address this case, by enforcing the configuration of
python3.6-minimal before unpacking python-minimal (and before removing
python3.5-minimal).  It does constrain apt's solver, but as long as apt can
find a solution, that's ok.
It may be an ignorable hypothetical, since the set of libraries that
python3.5-minimal + libpython3.5-minimal depends on is quite small, and they
are all very stable and well-maintained upstream (zlib, libexpat1, libc6,
libssl).
