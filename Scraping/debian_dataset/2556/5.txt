Unfortuantely even the latest version of Kotlin still uses Protobuf 2.x, so it's not going anywhere in a short time. This package will only build the Java libraries, everything else is stripped.
Though your suggestion works on another dependency of Kotlin, `spullara-cli-parser`, which is no longer used by the latest Kotlin. Thanks!
