Is this version of protobuf only required by Kotlin? I am thinking that maybe we can just include all those legacy libraries (and possibly JetBrains-modified ones) inside either Kotlin or `intellij-core` as they tend to be used only by those 2 projects at the moment. Thus we can really save a great amount of time from waiting for the NEW queue. We can do this to `picocontainer`, `protobuf`,`spullara-cli-parser` and `jdom`.
