dh_installsystemd(1) says: "It also finds the service files installed
by a packageâ€¦" which implies to me that it will operate on services
that were already installed as well as those specified in the debian/
directory.  The manual page is not that clear on whether it will
operate on other types of already installed unit file, but it does
appear to do so.
