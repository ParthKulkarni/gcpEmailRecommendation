Dear list,
After some work it seems that an updated LIRC package has landed in 
stretch without any major problems. This resolves the urgent need to 
update it to something recent enough to be supported by upstream.
One remaining problem is that lircd, the main LIRC daemon, runs as root. 
This is code from the 90's, heavily user-configured. Running this as 
root is just not sane, and other distros has moved to running it as a 
regular user since long. I want to make this change for sid/buster.
However, running lircd as non-root raises permissions problems related 
to /dev/... devices. Since lircd is configured in all sorts of ways, 
many kinds of devices are potentially used. The paranoid configuration 
is to block all devices for lircd, leaving it to user to enable them as 
required. This is a breaking update for almost all users.
The alternative is to use the Fedora strategy, outlined below. This 
means changing overall permissions for several /dev/... devices. Is this 
OK, should  it be discussed on this ML, or somewhere else?
- The /dev/lirc? devices are set user:group  lirc:lirc and mode 660 
(udev rule).
- The /var/lock dir is root:root 755 in my stretch box but this is 
seemingly #813703; assuming this will be fixed to 1777.
- lirc user gets read access to all USB character devices using a udev 
rule invoking facl(1).
I know that getting permission is harder than to be forgiven, but 
perhaps it makes sense to have a discussion first?
The possibly controversial issue is the USB devices. However, without 
this rule a large part of lirc users will be forced to painful udev 
rules configuration
Thoughts?
