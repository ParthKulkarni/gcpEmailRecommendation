Ummm...
Not that I know much about how ftp-masters work internally. But I have
been on several other Debian teams. In general, all decisions are
taken in the public - But it is by far not uncommon to resort to
private communication for many of the non-obvious, contentious
cases. There are *always* cases where you want to discuss something
without the affected actors being part of the loop.
Yes, Debian as a whole strives for openness, and you will often see
calls to "get out of private" whenever interesting discussions taking
place. But I would perfectly understand and support a ftp-master
workflow that routinely involves private communication - Their
decisions, although non-personal in nature, can be *felt* as personal
attacks.
