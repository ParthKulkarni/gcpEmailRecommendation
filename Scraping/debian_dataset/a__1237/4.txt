Hi debian-boot@!
tl;dr: can I make the apparmor package Priority: standard?
Context
=======
I'm working on the last blockers towards starting the experiment I've
proposed on debian-devel@ 2.5 months ago, i.e. enabling AppArmor by
default for a while in testing/sid.
Enabling AppArmor by default on new installations requires two
changes:
1. enable the LSM in Linux: problem solved, Ben Hutchings is fine with
   doing this in src:linux
2. install the apparmor package by default.
This email is about (2).
Priority: standard?
===================
My understanding is that making the apparmor package "Priority:
standard" i the way to go. Correct?
The package itself has "Installed-Size: 1803 kB".
I've trimmed the dependencies of this package a bit (just uploaded
2.11.1-2 as a result) so it seems to be an OK thing to do to me.
The dependencies are now:
  libc6 (>= 2.17),
  debconf (>= 0.5) | debconf-2.0,
  python3:any,
  lsb-base (>= 3.0-6),
  debconf
â€¦ i.e. only stuff that's installed by default already anyway.
Would you folks have any problem with this change?
Once this is done I'll coordinate with Ben wrt. pushing the other big
red button i.e. (1) once the other blockers have been resolved.
Cheers,
