For the kernel-wedge config, it generally doesn't matter whether a
driver might be built-in.  The "copy-modules" sub-command checks in the
"modules.builtin" file before looking for a real module file.  It's
only a problem if all the modules listed for a package are built-in,
because an empty package is treated as an error (maybe that should just
be a warning?).
