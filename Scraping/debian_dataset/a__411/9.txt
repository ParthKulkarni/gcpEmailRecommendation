One case where this truncation would be a challenge is the Numpy and
scipy ecosystem, where the extensions are tightly coupled to blas
library used and the numpy ABI - because extensions built on top of
numpy depend on that ABI. pip has had difficulty shipping binaries of
these stacks because it doesn't represent the ABI - it assumed that
anything with a matching version number was compatible, which isn't
the case. Arguably numpy should do something different there, but it
doesn't :)

Perahps its worth adding 'deprecations should be enabled if off by
default - at least during build-time' - I'm thinking of Python where
we (upstream) disabled deprecation warnings and many folk get
surprised as a result.
