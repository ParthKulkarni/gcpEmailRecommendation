Package: installation-reports
I wasn't sure How Debian would send you the report or how I'd get that
number since it didn't ask for my mail.
Please find the copy of my installation-report.bug file with this mail.
Would like to thank everyone involved in this project for this
wonderful distribution.
Regards
Akash
