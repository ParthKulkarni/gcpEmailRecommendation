  Description     : Automated phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks
Wifiphisher is a security tool that mounts automated victim-customized
phishing attacks against WiFi clients in order to obtain credentials or
infect the victims with malwares. It is primarily a social engineering
attack that unlike other methods it does not include any brute forcing. It
is an easy way for obtaining credentials from captive portals and third
party login pages (e.g. in social networks) or WPA/WPA2 pre-shared keys.
It will be maintained within the pkg security team.
