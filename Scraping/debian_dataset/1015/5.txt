The first reason for this is simply historical:  In the beginning it was
invented for Blends teams but in the end there was no point to restrict
the method for these teams only.
Considering the fact that the data gathering process is not very
performant I see no point in gathering data that are not used
afterwards.  If this would be really needed / wanted a cod review
needs to precede.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
