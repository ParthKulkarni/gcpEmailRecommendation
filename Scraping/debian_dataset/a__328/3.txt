Given that this was fixed, I'm not sure this is a great example of Debian
not dealing with this problem?

It's ongoing work to track down these sorts of Recommends and get rid of
unexpected or unintended consequences, and there probably will always be
bugs.  What I'm missing, as a reader of the thread, is some indication
that this is a comprehensive problem that involves a significant conflict
of opinions that needs to be escalated.
Maybe someone has a list of things they view as Recommends inflation that
have (a) been reported as bugs to the appropriate package maintainers, and
(b) have been rejected by those package maintainers?  Those are the
controversial ones that we'd need to talk about.
The ones where, once someone tells them, the package maintainer goes "oh,
whoops" and changes the dependency aren't a problem.  They're Debian
working as it should.
