Yeah, but I agree with the general feeling that it's extremely annoying
when bash-completion *removes* file names as completion options.
Sometimes the completion has a whitelist of possible filenames; when
that whitelist is incomplete or does not match my system, bash
completion does not help (on the contrary). Yes, it's possible to force
filename completion with alt-shift-/ (at least on my BE AZERTY
keyboard), but that requires a different keystroke than just "tab".
I think if bash had an option to allow programmable completion to add
additional completion options but not remove others, that would be much
much much more interesting.
