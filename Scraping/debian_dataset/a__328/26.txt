This one may be at the extreme, but it is one I personally encountered. 
I was installing nmap on a system (no gui) and was a bit shocked.  The 
problem is well articulated by one post (an my thanks to him for the 
work around).
I leave the policy debate to the insiders, but I will second the opinion 
that creating a user habit of "ignoring" something is generally a bad idea.
