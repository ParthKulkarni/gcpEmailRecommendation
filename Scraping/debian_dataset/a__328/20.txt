Actually, there's significant functionality for some part of
libreoffice-base (this is not the "core" of libreoffice, but the
database component) that's implemented in Java. You can still use
libreoffice-base without java, but that functionality won't be available
then.
I think that's a perfect match for "all but unusual" here.

This is about lxc being able to resolve the other containers and the
host system, not about other machines on the network.
You may not be interested in that, but it seems as a perfectly
reasonable thing for a recommends to me.

Yes, but isn't there missing functionality then? If so, that makes

I think this is something that can only reasonably be decided by someone
who actually speaks the languages in question.

freedoom is quite fun, actually, IMHO. I think this should be a Depends
rather than a Recommends, but perhaps there's a way to use a doom engine
without wads? Dunno.

PostScript is often used to store images, too. All these tools use
ghostscript as an import filter for opening those files.
It makes perfect sense to me?

No. Just, no. i18n is not a "feature" that we should disable by default.
It should be on by default. Users should not have to check every time
they use a program whether there's i18n files.
There is no stronger example than this to show the "all but unusual"
argument, IMO.

They make things go much faster ("The XS accessor methods were between
1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical pure-perl accessors in some simple
benchmarking.", the description says). However, since it's written in C,
it's not guaranteed to work everywhere. If they're not available or
buggy on your architecture, you might still want to be able to say "use
Moo;" without running into issues, but the normal way of using
libmoo-perl is to have libclass-xsaccessor-perl installed, too.
How is that in any way "bloat"?

devscripts has an "interesting" way to categorize recommends and
depends. Some of them are debateable, but they are internally
consistent.

Actually, gnome-screensaver has the ability to run xscreensaver hacks.

Read up on multiarch, then. Depends/recommends/suggests can only be
satisfied by packages from their own architecture.

libwww-perl has the ability to parse HTML forms, so that you can do
something like "download a form, get the unique nonce from the form, add
username and password, continue".
Whether that's worth a dependency is debateable.

Inkscape can import raster images to use in the vector images. Almost
any vector image will want to do that at some point, and for many of
those files you'll need to use an import filter.
How is that anything but "all but unusual"?

po-debconf has a tool to automatically email translators with
out-of-date translations to request an updated tranlation. It's called
"podebconf-report-po" and is extremely helpful! You should use it! And
yes, it requires to send out email.
Perfectly within the "all but unusual" description, IMO.

As with other "xs vs no xs" options in perl, "makes things go faster",
but there's still basic functionality when the dependency is absent.

Read up on capabilities, what they're useful for, and why you would want
to use them.
Suddenly you'll understand why you might want to assign some of them at
login time.

I believe this was because libpam-systemd uses libsystemd-shared, which
is found in the systemd binary package.
However, installing the systemd binary package does in no way require
that systemd is used as pid1.

So why do you have xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin installed, then?
[... bored now ...]
it feels to me like you've just looked at the package names and gone
"meh, wtf, don't need that". While that may seem "obviously correct" to
you, a short amount of investigation into most of those things you think
need to be thrown out (I haven't given any of those packages more than a
minute each) shows that there usually *are* good reasons to add a
Recommends.
Yes, sometimes there are too many of them; but no, that does not (and
should not) mean that we're Doing It Wrong(TM). It just means that
occasionally, you might want to file a bug, rather than rant on -devel
;-)
