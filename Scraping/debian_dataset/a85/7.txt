Thanks for pointing it out, this is fixed with

No. Isn’t that a violation of the FHS (see

and Debian policy?

Cool! I wasn’t aware of this.
https://github.com/Debian/debiman/blob/2517d8f6a070890469eb55d0533304a0da642f9e/internal/redirect/redirect_test.go#L237-L257
should give you a good overview of the URL schema which is now in use.
Let me know if that answers your question or whether you need more
details.

The language is already taken from the Accept-Language header if it’s
not specified. Adding a plain text format and respecting the Accept
header is on my TODO list.
I guess it depends on your point of view what a “normal URL” really
is. Maybe I also misunderstood your point — if so, please clarify.

Why? In general, I’d like to stick with the conventions that are used
for displaying manpages whenever a design choice is just about
personal preference and not about enabling/preventing use-cases.

It should be easy to configure a user style sheet to this purpose.
Just configure font-family of the .mandoc class to your liking.

Could you report this issue upstream at http://mdocml.bsd.lv/ please?

The truncation is done via CSS. I don’t know how to make the title
attribute conditional on truncation.

Couldn’t find that bit on the wiki page. Can you point me to where it
says that please?

I thought that bit should equal the domain name. Is that incorrect? Do
you have a reference for what it should contain?

I’m not sure. In practice, people are going to use the search function
of their browser anyway. I feel that a long list is easier on the eye
than a wall of text.

Where did you get this URL from? Is that used somewhere, or do you
just think it would be nice if such a schema worked?

I considered this but arrived at the conclusion that a URL becomes
more useful the longer it references the same document. I.e., if
someone posts a link to a manpage, I’d like to make sure that — as
long as said manpage is included in the distributions which we include
— that URL points to precisely that same manpage. If you wish, you’re
free to use the redirect functionality and always refer to suite
names.

Can you elaborate on what you mean?

I don’t want to overwhelm people with an overly long front page.

No. Due to the global view of manpages which is required for
cross-referencing and navigation, a run is somewhat computationally
costly (see https://github.com/Debian/debiman/blob/master/PERFORMANCE.md
for wall-clock time numbers). Hence, we intend to do periodic runs,
with a frequency of 1 or 2 hours.

We currently do, unfortunately :). There are TODOs in the source to
clean that up, but the site will keep working without update for the
next 2 Debian releases (excluding stretch) even if we don’t get around
to cleaning it up. Will amend the wiki page in a bit.

I intended to contact the ubuntu people and other manpage repositories
that I know of. Talking to derivatives is a good point, thanks.

Yes, already on my TODO, thanks.
