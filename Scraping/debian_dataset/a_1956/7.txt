The problem with maintainer-built binaries around NEW is that if they
wait in the NEW queue for (let's say) 1 month, then by the time they
reach the archive, they were built with a 1 month old toolchain and
build-dependencies, not an up-to-date toolchain and dependencies.
Reproducible builds don't help with this, because a package can
typically only be reproducible when holding the toolchain and
dependencies constant.
