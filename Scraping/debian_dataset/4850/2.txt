We were assuming that the author of the script wanted to send both 1 and 2
to /dev/null and was victim to the common mistake of getting the order of
redirections wrong.
You are absolutely right that our assumption about the authors intention
may be wrong, and that they really intended the redirection the way they
wrote it. This means that we should be more careful, and ignore cases in
which the above pattern occurs in a context which has itself a redirection.
As a consequence, we wouldn't detect a bug in a case like this one:
 (foo 2>&1 1> /dev/null) | /some/processing
This should be enough to eliminate false positives, right?
