I'd say that apt autoremove keeping Recommends even when called with
--no-install-recommends is a reasonable behaviour.  Same for
Priority:important or Important:yes packages.  The sbuild case is quite
special.
The functionality to keep a system squeaky clean would probably be better in
debfoster, but alas, it's effectively unmaintained.

The man page recommends -udcar, which includes autoclean, and, important
here, autoremove.
No idea about official buildds, but I remember hearing somewhere that the
Reproducible Builds project recreates them from scratch once a month.
