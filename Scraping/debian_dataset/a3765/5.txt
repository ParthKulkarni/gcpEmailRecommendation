Unfortunately not. I guess there are still a fair number of mpm_prefork users 
because of mod_php. But I don't know how many enable mod_http2 (it's not 
enabled by default). But I expect that there are extremely few users who 
actually depend on HTTP/2 working. For the vast majority, it's only a nice to 
have feature.
