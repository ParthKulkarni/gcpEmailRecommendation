hosts, not domains, but yes...

For the sake of completeness, I can confirm that the same problem
shows up when running on a different network too. I also see this
using the oldest amd64 daily I can grab (from 2017-01-17) which has
the 4.9 kernel too.
I'll see if I can debug this, but I'm not sure where to look straight
away.
