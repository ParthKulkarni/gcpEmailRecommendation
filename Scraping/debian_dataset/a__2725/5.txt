And since Steve was wondering how we could release something for Stretch
RC 1 with thatâ€¦ I've just confirmed that using -8 .deb with a -8 .udeb
(reversioned as -9+hack so that its being dropped under localudebs makes
it take precedence over sid's .udeb) leads to an image that's working
fine. And AFAICT that's the combination we had at the time.
I suspect the implementation change through the following patch in -9:
    glibc-2.24/debian/patches/any/cvs-resolv-internal-qtype.diff
plus 283e7a294275a7da53258600deaaafbbec6b96c1 in debian-installer.git is
what is triggering the issue? (Explaining why host's libc .deb have an
impact on the built images.)
It's been a while since I last looked at/understood mklibs stuff though,
feel free to fix my suspicions/conclusions.
