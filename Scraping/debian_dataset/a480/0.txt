And with the Policy, too:
¬ß10.1.
# Two different packages must not install programs with different
# functionality but with the same filenames.  (The case of two programs
# having the same functionality but different implementations is handled via
# ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù or the ‚ÄúConflicts‚Äù mechanism.
Regular "cd" changes the directory for the calling process (thus it even
can't possibly be a separate process), this "cd" takes two arguments and
runs a _child_ with the changed directory.
So having execline in $PATH conflicts not only with POSIX, common sense,
but even our Policy. :√æ
