The changelog is something which can be naturally derived from the
changes made to a source package and excellent tools like
git-buildpackage ("gbp dch") make this kind of work rather simple. A
package description usually doesn't change. Only in rare circumstances
it has to be adjusted. A Standards-Version header changes frequently,
gets obsolete even faster and provides no valuable information to the
end-user of a package (which a package description and changelog
obviously do)

I'm neither offended by this field nor emotionally affected by it. I'm
just concerned about the fact that we maintain information in our source
packages which
 a ) can be modified more efficiently outside of them
 b ) are redundant for a large group of maintainers
In fact my primary effort is to improve all packages which I maintain
and touch and by raising my voice on this list I hope that future
maintainers will suffer less from obvious design flaws. I am not aware
of a good reason why keeping the Standards-Version field would help me
in achieving this goal.
If the Standards-Version field is optional, great! Then let's get rid of
it right now. The Lintian error is presumably as mistake, isn't it?

Markus
