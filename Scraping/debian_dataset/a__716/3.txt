After a quick review, that looks good to me. Thanks for keeping the
changes minimal in unstable, which indeed can help test this further.
Also thanks for keeping track of this without my chasing you with my 9.1

I'll report back once I've tested this change from unstable, just to be
sure; release team: please wait a bit before letting this go through pu.
KiBi.
