If you are using testing/unstable (unlike Andr√©) then that might be a
regression caused by this change:
systemd (236-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  DynamicUser=yes has been enabled for systemd-journal-upload.service,
  systemd-journal-gatewayd.service and systemd-timesyncd.service.
  This means we no longer need to statically allocate a systemd-journal-upload,
  systemd-journal-gateway and systemd-timesync user and you can now safely
  remove those system users along with their associated groups.
and
systemd (236-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  ...
  * Stop creating systemd-timesync system user.
    DynamicUser=yes has been enabled for systemd-timesyncd.service so
    allocating a system user statically is no longer necessary.
I would suggest reporting a (separate) bug.
(That change was not present in Debian 9, so if there's a regression
there it shouldn't be affecting Andr√©.)
