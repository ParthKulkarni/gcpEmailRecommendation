What exactly are the benefits?
Are they worth making not upstreamable changes to 100 packages?
I would expect sane upstreams to resist adding a dependency on a library
version the is currently not present in the stable release of any Linux

How will you verify that this change is correct in all cases?
We have so many regressions due to Debian maintainers blindly making
