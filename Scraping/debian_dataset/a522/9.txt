I'm sure people don't request those reviews because they don't know or because
they forget. A lintian warning could help, or ftp-masters enforcing an ack.
Though I'd prefer the former as I wouldn't like NEW to have another bottleneck.

It's not in policy (but I don't think it has to be), but following the
conversation on #-ftp yesterday I opened:
#895949 lintian: warn about packages with udebs but no udeb line in shlibs
#895953 lintian: check that shlibs-version >= higher-version-symbols-file
The latter wouldn't enforce -V, but would check that we at least get a high
enough version in shlibs as compared to the .symbols file (and would have solved
the zstd problem).
Cheers,
