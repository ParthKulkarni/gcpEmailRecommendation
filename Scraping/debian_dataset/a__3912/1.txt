I suppose this fixes the problem with the upgrades of console-setup. But I
don't like this solution because even if it fixes the problem (does it?),
it is not the right solution.  I don't think console-setup 
needs /tmp for its work.  This solution works only because requiring 
/tmp to be mounted means some other dependency will be satisfied as 
well.  But who knows what this other dependency is...
