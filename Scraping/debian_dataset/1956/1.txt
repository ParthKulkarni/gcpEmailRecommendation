Which definition of "reproducibility" are you using for the purpose of 
this proposal?
As of today, the reproducibility definition in policy and what is being 
tested in the r-b infrastructure are quite different.
I would strongly object to raising the severity to "important" for 
packages where it is not proven that they are not reproducible according 
to current [1] policy.
