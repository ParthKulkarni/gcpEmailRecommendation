These statements are not in contradiction.  Saying "this package complies
with policy version X" doesn't say anything about what version of policy the
package *should* comply with.  Our tooling should absolutely be optimized
for reporting discrepancies against the current policy version, not for
second-guessing the correctness of a given Standards-Version declaration.
