I've just uploaded a fix, and asked the release team whether it looked
OK to include this for stretch r0, along the other changes (mainly
i2c-modules udeb from src:linux) for the final installer. I would
understand if they prefer to delay this for r1 (the first point
release), as this is just about fixing a use case that wasn't working
previously anyway.
