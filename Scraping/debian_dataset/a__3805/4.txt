And apt developers would argue back that apt could indeed do it if
someone would write a patch â€“ which isn't a new idea, the ddeb
granddaddy of what we have now already suggested apt changes [0] in
2006â€¦
I haven't seen the perl script (and I don't speak perl, so even if
I had), but from the description of the functionality it doesn't sound
too hard and like a natural fit. Personally I would just prefer if
someone writes it who knows how it should work and would use it â€“ not me
who doesn't even have the debug archive in its sources (as libc6-dbg is
not a -dbgsym yet) nor deals with crash.dumps all too oftenâ€¦
Long story short: I am happy to help via IRC/deity@ & Julian is at
DebConf in case someone wants to talk about apt in person.
