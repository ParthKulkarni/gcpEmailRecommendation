Thanks for the pointer. I didn't find anything for /proc/$$/maps but there 
is eu-unstrip from elfutils which gives the list of Build-IDs from a core 
file.
I hacked together a perl script that uses that and grep-aptavail to get 
the list of packages (assuming you already have the correct entries in 
sources.list).
Now, where to put it? Into devscripts? The disadvantage is that devscripts 
already pulls in quite a few other packages via recommends. But I don't 
have a better idea. Unless we want to include it in reportbug or something 
like that?

That would be nice. But I don't think I have time to look into that in the 
forseeable future.
Cheers,
