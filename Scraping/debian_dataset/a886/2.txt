<title>What is the Debian Installer?</title>
<para>
Debian Installer, also known as "d-i", is the software system to install 
a basic working Debian system. A wide range of hardware such as
embedded devices, laptops, desktops and server machines is supported and a
large set of free software for many purposes is offered.

The installation is conducted by answering a basic set of questions.
Also available are an expert mode that allows to control every aspect of 
the installation and an advanced feature to perform automated installations.
The installed system can be used as is or further customized.
The installation can be performed from a multitude of sources: USB,
CD/DVD/Blue Ray or the network.

The installer goes back to the boot-floppies project, and it was
