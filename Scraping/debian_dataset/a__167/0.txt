/etc/systemd/network/ doesn't exist on my system. I presume I would just
need to create it for this to work? I haven't been able to persuade
packages.debian.org to tell me which package it belongs to.

Thank you to both of you and to others for all your suggestions. Of course
if I'd read the release notes first I could have saved myself some time, but
they are usually aimed at upgrades rather than new installations and I
haven't performed any upgrades yet. I am curious as to what mechanism will
be used to preserve names on upgrades when reusing the kernel names is such
a bad idea.
Is everyone using their own custom naming schemes actually a good idea, or
would it be preferable to have some standardised names?

PS Feel free to tell me to go to Debian-User. I hoped the experience of a
"hobbyist" user would be a useful contribution.
