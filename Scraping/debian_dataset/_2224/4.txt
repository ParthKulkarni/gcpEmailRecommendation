Source: pkgsel
Version: 0.45
Severity: wishlist
Ubuntu has a patch adding a "pkgsel/update-policy" debconf question which
is used to control the installation of unattended-upgrades. I want to
merge this into Debian.
The biggest question in this work is the default value and priority of
the question.
Ubuntu defaults to "none" (no automatic installation) but asks the
question at high priority on netboot (non-cdrom) images or on their
server images.
For Debian, I don't think that making such a difference makes sense.
We should:
- either always show the question with its default value of "none"
  (thus making sure that they have a chance to opt-in to this feature)
- or not show the question (priority "medium") but make it default
  to install unattended-upgrades so that they get updates by default but
  have a chance to disable that with preseeding
Given the last discussion on -devel
(https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/11/threads.html#00117) I think
we should make a bold choice and do the latter.
I'm going to submit a tested patch later on.
