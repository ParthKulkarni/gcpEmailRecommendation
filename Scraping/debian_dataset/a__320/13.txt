Thanks for the nudge -- the thing I'd not got around to was checking
that the test also fails with the unpatched daily .iso -- which can now
be seen here:
  http://78.137.97.249:8080/job/lvc_debian-DI-miniiso-gui-daily-bugtest/7/console
whereas this is it succeeding:
  http://78.137.97.249:8080/job/lvc_debian-miniiso/337/console
I've also run a few other tests by hand, but there are of course
countless scenarios that I've not explored.
So, I think the fix ready for release.
Cyril,
  Are you OK with me including these patches, and releasing the two
  packages (rootskel, debian-installer-utils)?
Cheers, Phil.
