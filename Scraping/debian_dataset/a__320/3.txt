That's along the lines of what I think might be happening, yess

Correct, my (unchecked) assumption was that something in d-i would be
doing so.
You might find evidence of that in the fact that your net.ifnames=bar
ended up under /etc/ somewhere, either in /etc/modprobe.d/* or
/etc/modprobe.conf or /etc/modules.
It's only fair to warn you I might be talking BS here and reality is
nothing like that...
