I agree that the current check is incorrect and should be removed.
It's been possible for a long time to have dotted parameters for built-
in code, whether or not that code could ever be built as a module.

It is ugly that we will still end up writing module parameters for non-
existent modules.  But I'm guessing that for some other boot loaders we
don't set the kernel parameters at all, so setting (some) parameters
there is better than nothing, right?
