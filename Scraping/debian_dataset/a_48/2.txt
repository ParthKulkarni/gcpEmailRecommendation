Not sure why, as this seems to be a release matter.

It needs to be fixed in unstable first, anyway. Similarly I only see
inaction on the bug, not disagreement. (What you linked to as "[1]" is
different.) The fix itself feels fairly straightforward, given that it's
a consensual revert applied upstream.
I think this could be suitable for stable, but I'd suggest to you to
hash out the potential disagreement[2] in private mail to the
maintainers rather than on project-wide mailing lists (not even cc'ing
them).
Kind regards
