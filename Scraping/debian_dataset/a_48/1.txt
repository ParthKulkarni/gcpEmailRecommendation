Hi,
I'd like this fix
(https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=865316) to be part of
9.1, but one of the maintainers of the package seems to not agree with
the severity [1]. It is already fixed upstream and updated package is
prepared.
What are my options? Do I go ahead with an NMU (the severity is not
lowered on the bug report) ? Such attitude to casually break critical
tools and not caring to fix it is seriously disappointing. When you
install a fresh system and you can't get to make keyboard for your
language work, something that was always there, is seriously frustrating.

Note: I agree with him rejecting my membership request, since I'm only
interested in this fix, it was more suitable for a merge/pull request,
but this is a limitation of alioth, if you want to make changes, you
need to a member.
