Hi Joel,
I had a look at this Python package a while ago, and I was very
surprised to find that its interface does not match the one of the
functions in the base64 standard library module in the use of strings vs
bytes.  I had to introduce some wrappers to make it sane in that regard.
I see in the upstream repository some commits that suggest that this has
been fixed (breaking the API probably).  However, nothing that hints
that a release has been made after that.
It would be nice to have the fixed version in Debian and to avoid API
breakage, at least once the Python package enters the Debian archive.
Cheers,
Dan
