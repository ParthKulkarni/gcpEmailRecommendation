I have a machine mainly used to install Debian games. I had to stop
upgrading it because when games get removed due to obsolete libraries
getting removed and I keep those removed games/libraries installed, I
can't upgrade the rest of the system due to conflicts between the
removed packages and new packages. I've come to the conclusion that I
want to move all of the removed games into flatpaks/snaps
automatically generated from the snapshot.d.o archives. This is
probably the right sort of solution for all sorts of other
unmaintained software too, including stuff that is stuck on Qt4.
