I find it quite difficult to support you here seeing the piece of respect
you shown to each other on this thread.
First you complained about the lack of communication to say in
[ðŸ”Ž]Â 6b4cd362-ae68-aa61-e729-f1b93d1a16a7@physik.fu-berlin.de something like

Respect and coordination is a two way thing. Expecting the maintainer of a
package to do the whole work on his own is not really what I consider as
common sense. Especially when you know such package was in experimental for
two months.

As stated before, you didn't seem to consider that poking the maintainers to
ensure coordination was needed. It appears it was. The lack of coordination
is generally the result of two parts failing to acknowledge each other.

We're all working on a lot of things without expecting a "thank you" each
and every second. Claiming one just after starting a flamewar doesn't seem
really appropriate.
That said, thank you for your great work.

It's far easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.
