`dgit push` will force you to do any stitching that you haven't already
done (by telling you to pass --overwrite).  So it's not really something
you have to think too much about.

I also read Russ's e-mail, but I'm not yet convinced that powerful tools
like `git diff` and `git log` won't be able to give you the information
you need pretty quickly.  It might take a little time to craft the right
command, but that is easily outweighed by the time saved curating a
patch series.
