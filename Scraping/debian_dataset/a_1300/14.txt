The security team is, IMO, one of the most important non-maintainer consumers of Debian source packages.  They are also somewhat familiar with the Debian source format.  This matters.
As a new Debian administrator learning about how Debian packages worked enough to solve local issues was a high priority.  This was long before I was involved in Debian development.
Familiarity with Debian source packages isn't particularly obscure.  It's quite normal.
