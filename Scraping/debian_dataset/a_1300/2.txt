here's an opposite data point:
being forced to use git-dpm by the python-modules-team policy - i
haven't had a single joyful experience with git-dpm.
so far, every import of a new upstream release turned into a nightmare
with an extra working clone of the repository, and skimming through the
same man- and webpages full of outdated documentation even though i'm
pretty sure that the required information was there the last time i looked.
git-dpm might be useful if you use it daily.
as it stands, i'm a very happy gbp user (without fancy addons) for
almost all of my packages, and the few python modules i maintain don't
do releases that often (which explains why i don't get a routine for
doing new upstream imports with git-dpm).
