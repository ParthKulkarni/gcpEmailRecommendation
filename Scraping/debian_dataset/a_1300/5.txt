The thing that's delivered to users in 99% of the cases is the binary
package. In the (comparatively) rare cases where the user is retrieving
the source, I am not convinced that most of these users truly prefer a
Debian-specific source package with patches in debian/patches over a
standard Git repository with patches as commits.

end is. 
Best,
