TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are supported for client sockets
in Android since 2012.
TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are enabled by default for client sockets
in Android since 2014.
In other words:
When buster gets released, there will still be few hundred million 
Android devices in use that do support TLS 1.1 and 1.2 but have it 
disabled by default.
If you are a bank, then using TLS 1.2 in your online banking app
is not a problem on these devices.
The situation can be less rosy when a user tries to open a link to
https://www.debian.org in the default browser.
The recent trend of using HTTPS everywhere has the nasty side effect of 
TLS 1.0 being mandatory for public parts of webservers for as long as 
users continue to use browsers that don't support anything more recent.
Even a bank that might want/have to restrict the online banking part of 
their website to TLS 1.2 and secure ciphers will still have a huge 
commercial incentive to support everything no matter how weak for HTTPS
access to the public parts of their website where they advertise their 
services to potential new customers.
