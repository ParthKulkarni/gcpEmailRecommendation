Yes and no. The point was, even if all Debian based MTAs disabled
TLSv1.0/TLSv1.1 leading to delivery issues a very large portion of
senders won't fix their servers. They simply won't give a damn. Unless
Google and Microsoft do the same, in which case they suddenly cannot
reach >50% of their targets anymore and are forced ot fix their side.
The suggested procedure for Buster (disable TLSv1.0/TLSv1.1, then
contact everyone who breaks due to this) is not viable for email. This
will prevent public servers from testing Buster for the whole time.

Indeed.
