That's wrong.
Think of the "TLS 1.2 not working with WPA" discussed earlier here that 
might still affect half a billion active Android devices at the buster
release date.[1]
The online banking app running on such a device will support TLS 1.2
The PayPal app currently requires Android >= 4.0.3, released in 2011.

Corollary:
It is permitted to run your online banking app on an Android device 
with a 5 year old firmware with no security updates ever available.

Imagine Debian running on the AP providing the WiFi for a Cafe.
What you are saying is that the staff working at the Cafe should explain 
to their customers that they have to buy a new phone if they want to use 
the WiFi.

    actually is, or whether it can be mitigated - the point is that
    it is unrelated to TLS versions supported by PayPal or online 
    banking apps running on the device
