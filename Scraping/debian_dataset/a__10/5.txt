I'm not sure which bit of the quoted text you think is wrong.

Maybe, maybe not.  Depending on how it's implemented, it's non-trivial
to get TLS 1.2 support in there.  Just doing HTTP or TLS yourself is
easy enough, but if you want to use a webview, you're at the mercy of
the TLS libs of the OS.

I'd not be surprised if that gets bumped, but that's just my guess, I
have no knowledge into what their actual plans are.

Why would that be the case?  They're likely to just be using WPA2 or
have an open network, neither of which require TLS.
Arguing for keeping TLS 1.0 support means you're arguing for providing
users with a default-insecure setup.  In today's world, I think that's a
pretty poor choice.  Providing people with the possibility to fall back
to less secure solutions sounds like a much better choice, just like
it's possible to install an telnetd providing unencrypted logins, but it
requires you to actively go out and install it.
