Also, if I would be strict in what I'm sending out, I would not
support TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for outgoing connections, only for incomming
connections? For the offlineimap case that would still be a
problem.
TLS doesn't actually work this way, but it's my best guess to
what you mean.

My problem is that if we don't do something, TLS 1.0 will be used
for an other 10 year, and that's just not acceptable. So I would
like to do something so that hopefully by the time Buster releases
you can disable TLS 1.0 by default, and that almost no users would
need to enable it again.
Having TLS 1.0 (and 1.1) enabled by default itself is not a
problem, it's actually using it that's a problem. There are
clearly still too many that don't support TLS 1.2, but it's
getting better.
Disabling the protocols is the only way I know how to identify
all the problems. And I would like to encourage everybody to
contact the other side if things break and get them to upgrade.
