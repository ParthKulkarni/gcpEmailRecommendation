The log in that bug shows something connecting to a Postfix smtpd, so someone else's inbound isn't relevant to that bug.
I need to find more information on it, but that is most likely a case of the sender not falling back to plain SMTP and so likely not a Postfix issue.
This does highlight problems with the current situation with openssl.  I can't think of a case where no encryption is a better result than use of TLS.
