I agree with James. unreleased simply exists to be able to keep additional
packages for Debian Ports architectures. It's not any less trustworthy than
the regular unstable archive for Debian Ports.
On the other hand, having a working Debian Installer for Debian Ports would
be a huge step forward and would open up Debian Ports to all the users which
are currently being kept back by the rather user-unfriendly way of installing
Debian for the Ports architectures.
Also, with this bug fixed, us porters can start working on the remaining issues
more easily as then we would have an easy access to build logs of the latest
builds. (Yes, we have that now as well, but the builds are always failing with
the same problem, there isn't really a point to check the build log for other
issues).
Thanks,
Adrian
