I fully support James request to add this patch.
I haven't yet tested it myself, but d-i doesn't build for hppa (and
the other ports arches) simply because it doesn't pull from unstable/unreleased.
The hppa unreleased suite for example includes d-i packages for
installing the hppa boot loader (which will never be included in
the main suite itself simply because hppa isn't a release arch) and
James patch would fix that.
Please apply this patch. It doesn't influence the release architectures 
at all but helps the non-releases architectures a lot.
Thanks,
Helge
