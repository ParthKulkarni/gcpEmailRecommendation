True, it's pretty similar. But what I am suggesting is not actually to
check password strength (which could be done by linking to passwdqc,
btw) but actually generate passwords for the user, from a word list.
It's a distinct proposal.
I suspect it's likely to sit there for a while as well... But I didn't
want to lose track of it. :)
