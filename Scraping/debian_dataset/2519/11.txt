I think it's odd to say "here, I'm packaging up a replacement for your
library, but I'm not going to coordinate with you" when we are preparing
a (somewhat) coherent distribution, so I don't think that option should
be discarded. (Unless you have a reasonable worry that you experiment
will fail and hence don't want to bother people, I guess.)
Kind regards
