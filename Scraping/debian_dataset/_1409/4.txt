I have been able to build the d-i natively and boot from it. Thanks for
the help with that. The problem is, my kernel is still missing some
modules.

I have been able to build a Debian kernel using your tools. But I think
I am missing something... I followed
https://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html#s-common-official
section 4.3.
I did "make deb-pkg" and got linux kernel deb packages but still no
udebs. I did not find in the documentation how to create those udebs.
I guess once I have them I will be able to rebuild the d-i with my
custom kernel.
