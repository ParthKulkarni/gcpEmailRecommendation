Hi,
thanks for your work on documenting how to install jessie these days!

speaking of stuff which might be missed: 
https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/debian-installer/ has a prominent
note (marked with a red icon) saying/starting with: "If any of the
hardware in your system requires non-free firmware to be loaded with the
device driver..."
I think it would be great if "Debian 8 has been superseded by Debian 9
("stretch")..." could have such a red warning icon as well!

cheers,
