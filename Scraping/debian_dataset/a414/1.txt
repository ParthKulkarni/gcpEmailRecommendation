Thanks for reporting.
For the website, I have created the merge request with a proposal:
https://salsa.debian.org/webmaster-team/webwml/merge_requests/40
(I'm attaching the diff too).
Comments and/or improvements very welcome (CC'ing debian-boot). If there
is no activity, I plan to merge this in a week or so.
Respect to the release notes, I'm not sure if this documentation should
go there and in which section specifically (CC'ing debian-doc for help).
We have fixed our cron script for publishing the release notes against
git (thanks  Baptiste Jammet, and sorry for the delay!) and this means
that if a patch is accepted in the jessie branch of the release notes
(https://salsa.debian.org/ddp-team/release-notes/ ), it will be
published in the website too (we will build jessie release notes for the
website at least until the LTS support finishes).
Kind regards
