I don't see how this is related to the uploading stuff.

I think the current consensus is that it won't.

This is not true. Please read https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer
I think you mean regular non-DM non-DD maintainers.

The maintainer can also be preparing the package for uploading and you
cannot do anything to know that except asking them. And if they committed
the work in progress into the VCS the tracker will show that.
tracker could show RFSes though, like how-can-i-help does, actually I
thought it already shows them.

It only talks about NEW. tracker shows binary NEW, though only in the
version sidebar, not in the news.
Do you know any other states which it should track? It's not clear from
your email.

It's not clear what problems do you have with these packages and what are
you proposing to solve them.
