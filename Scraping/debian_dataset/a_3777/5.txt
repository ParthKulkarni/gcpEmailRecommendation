Hi All,
while browsing through salsa.debian.org packages I got a feeling that
displaying upstream's Readme by default is not exactly relevant to
Debian packages. I guess it would make more sense do display
d/Readme.source if available or d/changelog instead.
Or even something more advanced like tracker.debian.org for a package...
A repository owner should be able to override this setting of course.
