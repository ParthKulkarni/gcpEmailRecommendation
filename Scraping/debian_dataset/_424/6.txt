This could probably be resolved by adding some additional paragraph after the
table, explaining the flavors in more detail ...

So we only need the ppc64el flavor for powerpc, right?

That removal was included in the patch from James Cowgill in this bug,

But you are right, powerpc content was not completely removed at other
places in the manual, but is just not used. So it would be consistent, to
re-add that entry, but out-commented.
