It is not that --list-missing in itself will cause a lot of issues.  It
is that the documentation from v10 -> v11 is dauntingly long already and
I want to avoid making it worse.
  In fact, I have already moved a handful of things to compat 12 to
reduce the scope of v11.

Ack.  I mainly proposed it for enabling easier dh_missing already in
compat 11.  That said, we might get enough compat 12 items that it would
make sense to release compat 12 before the release of buster.
