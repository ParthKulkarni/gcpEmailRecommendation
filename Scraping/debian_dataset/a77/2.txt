Yes, I agree with this.  The only additional point that I would add is
that while offering sysvinit support may not provide much according to
objective measures of number of users or technical features, it provides a
*lot* in terms of social cohesion of the project, making fellow developers
feel valued, and continuing to help the project heal from some deep
wounds.
So yes, I agree that it's a wishlist bug, but if people have the time, I
think it's work that's worth doing, assuming it's not ridiculously
complicated for a particular package.
