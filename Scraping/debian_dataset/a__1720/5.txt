Recommends, rather than Depends is correct, based on your description,
even without a patch to enable use with inetd.  Anyone who is not using
systemd, either out of dislike of systemd or because they have real
requirements for no or a stripped-down init system, is able to add a
single line to inetd (or one of its successors).
However, adding Depends just because the package ships with a systemd
unit file, and no other init integration, is simply wrong.
Don't let the fact that systemd antagonists keep annoying you prevent
you from doing the right thing.  openssh-server has an uncompressed size
of 922k with a long list of Depends.  tinysshd has an uncompressed
size of 606k with only two Depends, libc6 and systemd.  Changing systemd
to a Recommends would make tinysshd significantly more useful in some
of the use cases where its stated description "minimalistic SSH server"
already makes it the preferred ssh server.
As a general rule, please use Recommends over Depends whenever it will
not truly break the package.  This is exactly what Recommends is for.
