I don't have the energy to care about packages outside of my control.
R people should take care of these packages by noticing regressions in
their packages.

This. And don't shift the burden to the maintainer of a package which
just happened to trigger autopkgtests, the maintainers of the package
whose tests fail are primarily responsible.
