Please don't file bugs until the triggering package is a single package.
Case in point, the upload of gdal (2.3.1+dfsg-1) triggered the
autopkgtest of r-cran-mi/1.0-6 which failed because r-base-core was also
updated to 3.5.0-5. The latter is the actual cause of the regression,
not gdal which triggered the autopkgtest. I would be annoyed if a bug
was filed against gdal in this case, and having to reassign it.
How will you deal with cases such as these other packages than the
trigger are the cause?
Kind Regards,
