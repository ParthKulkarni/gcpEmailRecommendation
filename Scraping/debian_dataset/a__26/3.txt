No, really it's not. It's already current practice:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?include=subject%3AFTBFS;submitter=lamby%40debian.org
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?include=subject%3AFTBFS;submitter=lucas%40debian.org
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?include=subject%3AFTBFS;submitter=sanvila%40debian.org
Are you suggesting that we should refrain from reporting FTBFS bugs as
serious unless we have a build log from buildd.debian.org in our hands?
I'm sure you are not, but I've seen people downgrade bugs "because
they do not happen in buildd.debian.org" and at the same time nobody
of them realize what would happen if we followed such silly
(and wrong) rule in a consistent way.

Well, maybe what it's excessively aggressive or questionable is to run
the tests at build time and making the package build as a whole
to fail when any test fails.
I have the feeling that this autopkgtest things should be used (among
other things) to de-couple package builds from package testing.
Then people who test that packages build ok would have one thing less
to worry about.

No, the appropriate reaction would be to disable the failing tests via
NMU until the maintainer exits the hospital and can investigate.
Thanks.
