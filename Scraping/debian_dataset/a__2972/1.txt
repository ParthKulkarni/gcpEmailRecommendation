Hi,

Many thanks for the initial pointer and the libbsd bugfix. Unfortunately
that wasn't our issue at all (we don't use libICE and there's no udeb
for it anyway). I've documented my findings in a blog post:
  https://debamax.com/blog/2018/05/25/debugging-black-screen-in-debian-installer/
Summary: The issue is rather that we have fontconfig needing UUIDs for
font handling, calling uuid_generate_random() from util-linux, which
uses getrandom(), trying a few times with a little delay between each
attempts when EAGAIN has been returned, before finally falling back to
reading from /dev/{u,}random.
I don't think making util-linux accept low entropy is the way to go,
even if I've checked that doing so makes this issue go away for the
graphical installer (see attached patch against util-linux, which
pretends that getrandom() isn't available), since it can be used in
things more critical than getting UUIDs for fontsâ€¦
Maybe fontconfig could be modified to use a different function to get
UUIDs (at least for its udeb build, in case uuid_generate_random() is
strongly preferred for its regular build) in its FcDirCacheCreateUUID()
function?
I'm adding util-linux and fontconfig maintainers to the loop for their
input/feedback.
Thanks for your time.
Cheers,
