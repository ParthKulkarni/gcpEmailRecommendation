This sounds similar to the regression seen in stable affecting gnome-
session.  libICE has a function for generating the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
cookie, which now uses libbsd's arc4random_buf() which now uses
getrandom().  getrandom() is documented to block (by default) when not
much entropy is available, but until recently it could return too early
after boot.
I don't know whether the cookie is generated this way when d-i starts
the X server.
I opened bug #898088 against libbsd because arc4random_buf() is
documented to return "very quickly".
Ben.
