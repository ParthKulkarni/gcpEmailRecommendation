In my opinion, one solution is to move all mac specific layouts to the 
respective pc file.  Then we can get rid of the files in macintosh_vndr.  
I don't see a problem if we allow mac users to use non-mac layouts and 
pc users to use mac layouts.
By the way, did you select Mac keyboard model manually?  As far as I can 
remember, by default, keyboard-configuration (hence the installer too) 
use pc keyboard model on Macs (and not macintosh, ibook, powerbook, 
macbook78 or macbook79).
Are there some problems if you reconfigure keyboard-configuration to use 
pc keyboard model?  In this case there will be no need to copy the altgr 
part of the pc keyboard to the macintosh one.
