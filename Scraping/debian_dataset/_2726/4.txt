Package: keyboard-configuration
Version: 1.160
Severity: important
Hi,
I have a macbook pro with us keymap, I tried different layouts available in keyboard-configuration to get accents, but ended with
Can not find "mac" in "macintosh_vndr/us". or Can not find "altgr-intl" in "macintosh_vndr/us".
and No Symbols named "altgr-intl" in the include file "macintosh_vndr/us" or No Symbols named "mac" in the include file "macintosh_vndr/us"
I ended up copying the altgr part of the pc keyboard (found in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols) to the macintosh one.
I already had the same kind of problem with mac french azerty keyboard.
I think either the /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/macintosh_vndr files should be corrected or choices in the keyboard-configuration setup reduced to what's really available (it took me quite a long time to understand why I couldn't get the accents though everything looked fine).
Thanks
Raphael
