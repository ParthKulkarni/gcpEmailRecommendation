I expect the "incorrectness" is the troubling part of this scenario.
It certainly tickles my OCD tendencies.
In addition, cycles of joining/leaving/joining DM should not give one
any extra privileges over a new DM. Same goes for DD, which is why DSA
strip LDAP groups from retiring/MIA/rejoining DDs. I think ftp-master
should automatically do the same for DMs.
