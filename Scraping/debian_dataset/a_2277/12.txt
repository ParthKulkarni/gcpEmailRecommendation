I would like to propose a one letter change FTP -> FTW
For The Win Team is also For The World ;-)
Unfortunately For the World Masters seems...erm...slightly...?
...Well, in keeping with the Toy Story theme, FTW Masters is
worshipped by the Squeezes (packages alien to the archive) and at the
time of a "Win" a package new to the archive is selected as for the
"World".  Finally, New Maintainers tremble with trepidation at the
power of The Claw, as it is known internally.
Yes? ;-)
Cheers,
Nicholas
