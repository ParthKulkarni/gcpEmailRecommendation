FWIW a future version of the proprietary google-chrome-* will pick up

needs to be pushed more quickly, please let me know in private.
That said, I think Paul's suggestion on just installing the right 
packages when a u2f device is found makes sense as well. But they might 
be somewhat transiently connected and I don't think there are prompts on 
device plug-in?
Kind regards and thanks
