Attached is a patch against partman-base that should fix this
issue.  During testing it I have stumbled over two other issues,
though:
a) In my local d-i builds the bootscript doesn't seem to get
   properly installed in the netboot SD card images (although it
   apears to work properly for other image types and the daily
   builds on d-i.debian.org look ok), so for now I have only
   tested an installer build that was booted by tftp.
b) Partman sometimes exits with errors during formatting the
   /boot partition or in other cases the installed system doesn't
   boot due to errors in the /boot filesystem.  In bug #854857,
   excactly the same issue has just been reported by somebody
   else.
I haven't yet committed my patch as I would like to have a
completely successful test installation from SD card with my
patch applied (although the patch appears to be orthogonal to the
other two issues).  I would appreciate very much if one of the
people more familiar with the internals of partman and libparted
could take a look at bug #854857.
I'll try to take a look at the two issues descibed above
as well, but I currently lack the time to do so.
Regards,
Karsten

Subject: [PATCH] Fix bug #854822 (guided partitioning can overwrite boot
 firmware area)
For systems that are known to have their boot firmware on an mmcblk
device, protect the firmware area on all mmcblk devices (and not only
on mmcblk0) from being clobbered during guided partitioning and add
missing whitespace to the corresponding log output.
(Closes: #854822)
