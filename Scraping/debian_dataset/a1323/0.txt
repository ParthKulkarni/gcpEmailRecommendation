Hello,
when using the "Guided - use entire disk" option, partman by
default clobbers the boot sector and the area after it (where
u-boot is located) to make sure that there are no remains of old
partition tables.  We have code in partman-base that disables
this clobbering on systems of which we know that u-boot would be
damaged (which includes systems based on Freescale SoCs such as
your Cubox-i), but this doesn't work in your case as we currently
only disable the clobbering for /dev/mmcblk0 while your SD card
shows up as /dev/mmcblk1. I am not 100% sure about that, but IIRC
with older kernels the SD card in the cubox-i has shown up as
/dev/mmcblk0. 
The relevant code in partman-base can be seen here:
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/partman-base.git/tree/parted_server.c#n1377
The easiest solution would be to check for /dev/mmcblk instead of
/dev/mmcblk0. If nobody has objections against this change, I'll modify
partman-base accordingly and upload a new version (CCing the partman-base
uploaders Max Vozeler, Anton Zinoviev, Colin Watson and Christian Perrier
and Kibi as the d-i release manager).

I have similar experiences with systems based on other ARM-SoCs,
but I have not been able to pinpoint the cause. The hang happens
only when rebooting from the d-i environment; rebooting the
installed system with exactly the same kernel works without
problems.
