Unfortunately such a mechanism does not currently exist. You can try to
peruse the daily builds hosted on https://d-i.debian.org for this. They
are rebuilt daily and should be able to install testing.
It's mostly driven by some complexity in ensuring consistency. There is
currently not a single continuous build and upload process that deals
with new source uploads to the main archive. We'd need to trigger builds
whenever testing changes and then auto-upload a corresponding build.
It's both a technical and political problem to make that happen.
Kind regards
