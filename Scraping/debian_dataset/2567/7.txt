The upload will stay in the queue forever until either the key becomes
trusted again and so it can be processed (e.g. you push an update the
the keyring maintainers push it to the live keyring) or an ftp-master
manually moves it out of the way.
The next keyring update will most likely happen in ~3 weeks time.
Note that having somebody else sponsor the same version again now will
fail (queued will reject it), so in case you'd like to have those
packages updated within the next 3 weeks you'll need somebody to sponsor
you an higher version (and then these uploads will be rejected once the
key is trusted again).
