Hello all,
console-setup currently has two translation updates pending (Catalan
and Spanish) which should make me build/upload it but also has the
change below.
Ideally in this pre-release time, I shouldn't be uploading as is. May
I suggest that the relevant commit is moved to a "post-release" branch
or are there advices that this change should be in the released
package.
Seeking for advice, then.....
