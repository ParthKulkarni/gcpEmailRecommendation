Dear developers,
I would like to ask about the status of secure boot in Debian and
possibly help with testing.
I came across some HP EliteDesk 705 computers which have secure boot
enabled and unfortunately noone knows the bios password to disable it.
The stretch image on usb was not recognized as valid option to be booted :-(
Fortunately ubuntu supports secure boot for some time already, so I
was able to install it as an interim solution, but I would prefer
Debian.
I am no developer, but if you need testing of the secure boot images,
I can help.
Best Regards,
Frank
