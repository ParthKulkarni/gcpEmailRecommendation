Really? It's been years I'm working on OpenStack, that's not what I saw.
Could you explain a bit more?

What kind of specific server do you have in mind here?

The bare minimum one is to expect is: keystone, nova, glance, cinder,
neutron, heat. And generally, you also find swift. I don't see how a
public cloud provider would not provide at least these. Barbican is also
slowly becoming a standard too.
Now, if your provider also has trove, designate, magnum, manilla,
murano, neutron-{fwaas,lbaas,vpnaas} and so on, that's only a bonus, but
you often can deal without them.

This is somewhat exaggerated. Yes, because of historical reasons,
there's both Alembic and SQLAlchemy-migrate. Though oslo.db supports
both, and in practice, it's not a problem. Though in general, I do see
that most projects are disciplined and do work on the same direction. If
you consider the amount of dependencies (539 for the last Rocky
release), it's kind of nice that they are all worked out as a whole.
Lots of things have been standardized. The technical committee is also
there to steer in a single direction.
So, if that's your feeling, I'd suggest you look a 2nd time. I really
don't think OpenStack is a dysfunctional project.
