Yeah, thanks for this very reasonable argument. Not. Our Social Contract
says that we adhere to Free Software, no? So even though there are
limitations (but we're working on those as well), I don't see why this
justifies switching to proprietary solutions where free ones are available.

I don't buy this argument either. If you follow this logic, why not
switch to use Github and Travis CI only? Would be the cheapest and we
even wouldn't have to maintain it on our own. Yay!
And yes, maybe free cloud solutions are more expensive. Do you have
calculations? Apart from that, it's not an argument for me to not
consider them. And besides, that's your assumption only. It hasn't been
discussed in public before and the project was not asked for better
alternatives either.
