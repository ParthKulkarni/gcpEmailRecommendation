I presume this issue arises because people (myself included) dislike the
fact that in order to install some RFCs and/or GNU documentation one has
to flick a switch that also opens the door to some thoroughly
proprietary software.
Of course there are several lines that could be drawn in a variety of
places, but it might be nice to have the ability to only enable some
subset(s) of non-free in one's sources.list (without having to specify a
lot of fragile pinning)
I suppose it might be possible that we (as a project) could agree to
some of these subsets being easier and/or harder to enable, and thus
allow the FSF to feel more cheerful about the way we look at the world.
Cheers, Phil.
