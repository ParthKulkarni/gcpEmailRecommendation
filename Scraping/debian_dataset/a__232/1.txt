I'm not so sure whether this goal is uncontroversial, this is Debianâ€¦ ;)

Please not like this. while I *might* share the goal, I think this 
implementation is IMHO rather horrible. "antimetapackages" sounds unclear at
best and the whole concept is *way* too complicated.
plus, we have something complicated which can achieve the wanted effect today
already: apt pining.
I think Debian has better things to do than working on fine grained control
over non-free stuff. Obviously anybody is free to work on this, but I dont
think we should make our repositories, packages, policies and workflow soooo
much more complicated and harder to understand, for very little gain.
