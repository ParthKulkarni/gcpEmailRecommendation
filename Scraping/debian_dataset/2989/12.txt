yes, probably. As it was 2018 (and not 2017) I think it's highly
unlikely that your build didnt produce a .buildinfo file, so it means it
must have gone lost somewhere on the way.
Do you by chance still have the old changes file and can check whether
it included the .buildinfo file?

We just always tend to look at sid, because that's how buster will be in
the future. From our POV there is not really a difference as (usually)
builds happen in sid only anyway, so the only relevant diff between
buster and sid (for us here) is that buster has a bit less packages, so
the stats look better.
(sid has 28043 packages in main, while buster has 26621.)
