The difference is that the mozilla binaries are built against GTK+ 3, whereas
the Debian 45esr binaries are built against GTK+ 2. I don't know whether that in
itself causes the bug that you reported.
What about your 52 builds? Were those built against GTK+ 2 or 3?
I am building 52.1esr on wheezy now [1], which will be built against GTK+ 3 when
we upload it (45esr is now discontinued, so we'll upload 52esr with the next
round of updates in about three weeks). I'll test it and see if that helps.
Cheers,
Emilio
[1] I had a build around, but removed it on a quest to free some disk space.
