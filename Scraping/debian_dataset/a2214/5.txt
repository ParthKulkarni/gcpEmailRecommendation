For python3-app I would actually consider it a bad idea to make it 
visible at this point in time (except for native packages):
I can clearly see how for example python3-package from your list is an 
issue that can become painful for users in buster, but whether a program 
uses Python2, Python3 or Perl is usually irrelevant for the user.
In 2020 when Python2 is already EOL and other distributions have already 
removed Python2, Debian will get this in most cases automatically just 
by upgrading to the latest upstream version.
Trying to do anything about python3-app already in 2017 would only 
create extra work with close to zero benefits to users of Debian.
And what should a maintainer do based on a python3-app bug or lintian warning?
"Please convert to Python3, the 2021 release of Debian will drop Python2"
sounds hilarious if sent to upstream today.
