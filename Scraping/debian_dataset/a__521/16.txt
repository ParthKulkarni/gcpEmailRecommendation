No.
Apache 2.0 is compatible with GPLv3 [1] (therefore also with GPLv2+).
That is a fact, and its the worst case situation (assuming that the
re-license to Apache 2.0 actually happens)
I know that the FSF holds the view that Apache 2.0 is not compatible
with GPLv2 [1]. But, at the same time I have read that "many prominent
open source lawyers consider the GPLv2 and Apache 2 licenses to be
compatible already" [2].
So, the best case situation (IMHO) would be that a lawyer tell us that
Apache 2.0 is also compatible with GPLv2-only, and that we stop playing
the game of being amateur lawyers instead of software developers.
