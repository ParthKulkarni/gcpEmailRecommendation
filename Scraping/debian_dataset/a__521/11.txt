Right. That is how it also works in Spain, and I suspect that in many
other countries work the same way.
I understand that Debian wants to take a position of zero (or minimal)
risk, and I also understand the desire to respect the interpretation of
the FSF about the GPL (they don't think this two licenses are compatibles).
So that's fine.
However, I still don't understand why we don't just declare OpenSSL a
system library; or at least define a clear policy for when a package is
considered part of the base system (so the GPL system exception applies
to it).
RedHat did this (see me previous (by date) mail on this thread), and
they didn't had any problem in this regard (AFAIK).
