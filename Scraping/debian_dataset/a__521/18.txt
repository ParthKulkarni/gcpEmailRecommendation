Do you have any link or resource that can back what you say here?
I didn't knew about the Netatalk project, but after Googling about this
issue I only see an upstream frustrated because they are unable to
re-license [1], as they are unable to contact all the contributors the
project has.
As you can imagine, any successfully open source project will accumulate
hundreds of contributors along the years (at least 17 years [2] in this
case). Contacting them may be simple just impossible (people change of
email address all the time, people also pass away, and people can just
simply ignore the mail because they are busy with some other stuff).
On top of that, the incentive to take into doing this hard work is not
very big, as either not all downstreams take this issue with the GPL and
OpenSSL as far as Debian, or they include OpenSSL as a system library.
I also see Netatalk was shipped until Fedora 23 with OpenSSL support!
[3], until it was retired because nobody cared to keep maintaining it [4].
IMHO: if your business model is to sell pre-built binaries with some
feature, its better that you keep this feature with the right license
that prohibits distributing it and forces everyone to build from
sources, rather than relying on some incompatibility between the GPL and
OpenSSL that is not going to stop anyone but Debian and its derivatives
from shipping it.
