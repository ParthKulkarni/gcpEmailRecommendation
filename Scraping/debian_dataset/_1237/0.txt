It makes sense in any kind of system that runs its own Linux kernel:
not in chroots & containers (there's WIP upstream for allowing
containers to stack their own AppArmor policy on top of the host's one
but we're not there yet), but definitely in systems installed by d-i
(be it during initial installation or dist-upgrades, see the email
I've just sent to -devel@ about the latter).

No, it doesn't make sense to install it there; it shouldn't harm
either. So far I've kept src:apparmor building on non-Linux ports in
the hope some portability issues turn out to be real bugs that affect
Linux too, but this never happened. So if it simplifies the problem
let's build the package only on Linux ports.

Replied. Anything else you need from me to answer this question?

No problem, I don't want to cause issues that could easily be
prevented :)
