Hi,
I verified in the web interface on Salsa that my public ssh key
from alioth was imported and to be very sure I uploaded it again.
Unfortunately this does not changed anything
   $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_debian2 tille@salsa.debian.org
   tille@salsa.debian.org: Permission denied (publickey).
The authentication log of the web interface does not mention any
failed attempts.
Am I missing something?
Kind regards
      Andreas.
