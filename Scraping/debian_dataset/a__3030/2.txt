The assumption is that you have no files, so that debootstrap can extract
debs, then when enough is there, it can redo the packages properly with
dpkg and end up with a sane state for the packaging system.
If there are already files there, how would debootstrap have a clue how
to end up in a sane state where all the files present are accounted for
in the packaging system?
It only works now, because debootstrap is the only thing that puts files
there and hence knows what to do to make the package system state match
what is there.  It has to require that no files exist when it starts to
end up with something sane.
