I agree that having subsets of non-free would be useful for folks who
don't need all of it, but they should be subset components like
non-free/firmware rather than top-level components like
non-free-firmware.

I don't think we need a GR to do sub-setting of archive components,
just dak coders.

If we go with the subset approach I suggest the firmware packages
would still be in the non-free/contrib "areas" and still be in the
pool/non-free directory on our mirrors but would also be mentioned in
the non-free/firmware/*/Packages files, which would be the firmware
subset of the non-free component.
