Certainly. Sorry, I filed this from my laptop, in a hurry, and forgot to
edit the Version field.

Thanks for the pointers. I've really be meaning to file this to make
sure it's documented/known. I won't have much time until tomorrow,
that's why I was suggesting just debcheckout (or apt-get source)
debian-installer and cd build && ./daily-build build-only in the
meanwhile.
See you.
