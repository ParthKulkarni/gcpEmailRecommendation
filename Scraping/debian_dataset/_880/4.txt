Wifi doesn't come up after a console login once a normal install happens

the /etc/networks/interfaces file created as a result of the install 
process originally gets copied to the hard drive in the correct 
directory with the proper name and contents.  Many ways exist to solve 
this problem and it took a while to find out what to do and how because 
there's more and better support from debian-users than is in debian wiki 
or debian documentation.  I had learned how to do this earlier but 
apparently an individual known as longwind from China ran into this 
problem after I had learned to solve it on this end and the original 
message I read from Brian had a solution I hadn't read earlier and 
hadn't tried yet which involved far fewer steps.  Fortunately I have a 
hard drive available so I will try Brian's solution out on this end and 
see how it works.  Thanks for your assistance and interest.
