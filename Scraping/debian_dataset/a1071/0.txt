Hi
Unfortunately, alioth continues to be referenced on various pages, still.
Just 1 example:
In
   https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.kernel-compilation.html
one of the first links points to:
    GOING FURTHER: http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/
It would be great if this could be updated as soon as possible.
What is the time horizon where these left overs are completed?
Cheers
