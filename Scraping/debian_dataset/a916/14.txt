Python 3.6 was released 23 December. The stretch transition freeze was
on 5 November, a month and a half earlier. Upgrading the default
Python 3 from 3.5 to 3.6 is a transition, and given the number of
Python packges, it's likely to be a large on. What's more, Python 3.6
isn't even in experimental yet, so it seems to me that it's way past
the time when switching to it would be appropriate. After all, the
point is not to sneak in a new version at the latest possible moment,
but instead make sure whatever version of Python is in stretch, and
all the packages that use it, work very well
It'd be nice to have the newest of the newest of everything in a
Debian stable release. That seems to be incompatible with actually
making a stable release.
This time, us Python users need to compromise and make do with a
slighly older version of Python. It's not too bad.
