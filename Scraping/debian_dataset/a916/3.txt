Galbo is referring correctly to the minor version, as specified in
<URL:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/> and Semantic Versioning
<URL:http://semver.org/>.
So, “3.5.3” → “3.5.4” is a change of patch version. “3.5” → “3.6” is a
change of minor version. And “2” → “3” is a change of major version.
