We're not talking about “every project”. We are talking specifically
about Python, where “minor version” has the meaning Gablo used.
$ python3
Python 3.5.2+ (default, Dec 13 2016, 14:16:35) 
[GCC 6.2.1 20161124] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> sys.version_info.major
3
>>> sys.version_info.minor
5
>>> sys.version_info.micro
2
So, the changes Andrey describes are not changes in the minor version.

Which Python calls the “major” version component.
