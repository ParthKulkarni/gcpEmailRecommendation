Package: installation-reports
Version: testing
Severity: critical
Justification: Unable to install debian with netinst image on systems with these
NICs
With the latest weekly Debian testing netinst image (06-25 and 07-02 tested),
the e1000e, ixgbe, and igb modules cannot load.
Attempting to do so generates this message in the kernel log:
        Unknown symbol: refcount_inc (error 0)
The kernel on this image is reported as 4.16.0-2, and magic ver from 'modinfo'
reports the same version. Perhaps there's some other module dependency that is
not included in the image?
Note that I did not try to load all ethernet drivers included in the image, so
it's possible that there are more drivers affected.
This issue makes it impossible to install Debian testing with the netinst image
on system with these ethernet adapters.
