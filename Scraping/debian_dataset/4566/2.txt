If you have added an autopkgtest to your package, you probably have an
interest on it being run and pass, otherwise why did you bother in the
first place?
Or if those tests come from autdep8, then simply ask for the package to
be removed from the whitelist, or don't make your package be a snowflake
that autodep8 doesn't work for it.

autoremoval mails contains tons of false positive and cases where
regular package maintainers can do nothing about but watch.
