It appears that the maintainer closed the bug explicitly when
submitting the package to experimental (or is there a bug in
the BTS management system?):
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=790204#78
Shouldn't the bug remain open until it is fixed in unstable? Or
is the "sid" tag + version information (now present) sufficient
to make the bug remain visible?
BTW, I've just tagged it "fixed-in-experimental".
