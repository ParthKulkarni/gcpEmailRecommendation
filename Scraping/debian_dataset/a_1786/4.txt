I think the outcome would change significantly.
The copyright holders of the purely-GPL-licensed library (e.g.
readline) have never granted any linking exception, explicitly or
implicitly. They are not the ones who implemented support for OpenSSL
in the program.
Other developers designed and implemented the program, which links with
the purely-GPL-licensed library and with OpenSSL at the same time.
In this scenario, you can determine the intent of the program copyright
holders, but what you need is a linking exception from the
purely-GPL-licensed library copyright holders, not from the program
copyright holders!
