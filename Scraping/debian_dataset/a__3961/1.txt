This is a 'high-end' OEM server box, and that OEM is very involved with
the UEFI Forum. Make sure you have the latest Intel ME and firmware
updates. And perhaps Intel AMT update, though likely not related to the
issue.
If you are having problems with UEFI on a vendor's box, you might try
running Intel's LUV-live (Linux UEFI Validation) distribution[1], to
test out that UEFI implementation. Look at the output of FWTS[2] and
CHIPSEC[3], at minimum, for any problems. And/or, run FWTS-live to run
FWTS interactively. If these firmware tests show problems with your box,
then any OS/distribution, like Debian, may have problems with that
system. I might also try rEFInd's distribution, to see if that boot
loader works with it.

Hope this helps.
