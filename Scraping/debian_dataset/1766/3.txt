"However, the basic ideas seem like good ones, and I'll look into adopting these with a less offensive implementation."  Seems like the author liked the concepts behinds the patches, but felt that the patches needed more work. I think I would have started by trying to submit a smaller change (e.g. maybe the first patch in the series).The author of `passh`, the forker of `pass` is now also in the To: field.I did add Ivan as an invite to join this discussion.To know why the fork was needed. ( and maybe if it could be avoided )Previous postings are at http://bugs.debian.org/858229  I don't see any response to this email.  Doesn't inspire confidence :-(The ITP is about six hours old.Allow people some time to response  :-)GroetenGeert Stappers
