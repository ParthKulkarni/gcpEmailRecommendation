Hello,
I am also doing regular local builds, because I like being able to
a) use debdiff to the previous upload and b) compare buildlogs.
This is not a blocker for source-only uploads, though, you can generate
a source-only changes file from the full_build_changes file like this:
mergechanges --source -f exim4_4.89-7_amd64.changes exim4_4.89-7_amd64.changes
hth, cu Andreas
