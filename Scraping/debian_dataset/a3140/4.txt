Done in last commit. Example
  $ salsa fork node-mongodb
  $ cd node-mongodb
  $ git checkout -b fix-0000
  $ # Modify something
  $ git commit -a -m 'Fix something' -m 'Closes: #0000'
  $ salsa mr --mr-remove-source-branch
New MR is created using your last commit!
Many options available:
https://salsa.debian.org/yadd/devscripts/blob/devscripts-salsa-890594/scripts/salsa.pl#L405
Yo use salsa with another GitLab instance:
