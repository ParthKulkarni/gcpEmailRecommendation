Sorry, didn't intend to hurt your feelings, just trying to raise my
concerns as a user and trying to understand the process. I don't know
how the testing process works at debian, but If I were making the point
release of a distro, one of the basic things I'd check is whether the
ISO installs work on an actual physical machine (not in a VM) - and
doing so would have helped catch this bug as there are usually no
network resources (like wifi, etc.) configured at boot time that could
have provided internet connectivity (in which case, it used to work and
the bug wasn't apparent).
I understand that bugs are a part of the linux distro life cycle, but
I did not expect something as basic as an install process to falter.
But again, maybe I'm wrong about the bug being so apparent, and its
just easy to say this in hindsight.
No offence meant, have a nice day!
