So you make the decision that everyone should talk to their providers
etc.? I can actually understand your point but I strongly disagree with
action. I would actually be fine with it, if we were able to solve all

Therefore my ssl packages are on hold and will be as long as needed.
Unstable should not be mis-used this way.
