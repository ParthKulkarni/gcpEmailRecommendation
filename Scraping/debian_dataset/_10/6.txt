If you need more "firepower" for management: The BSI (german
governmental organisation for security in information technology) has
guidelines regarding cryptography, see 
https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR02102/BSI-TR-02102-2.pdf
They say in their technical guidelines that TLS 1.1 is not recommended
anymore and TLS 1.0 is not recommended at all.
SSLv2 and SSLv3 are not recommended.
So, if managers want to have somewhere "officially" written that
TLS1.0 and 1.1 shouldn't be used anymore, this is a guideline I can
recommend.
And IMHO we as debian should support all people going for stronger
encryption by enabling it as good as possible and make it default. If
someone wants or needs to use older ciphers, he should be able to, but
it shouldn't be default...
best regards, Hanno
