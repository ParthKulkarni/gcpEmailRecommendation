At least for me it was clear that replying to bugs counts as activity,
but maybe that was more my preconceptions than the wording of [c]. I
would be fine with replacing/augmenting the wording about bug triaging
to cover all BTS activity related to the package in question. On the
other hand the wording "if in doubt" covers the case you mention.
