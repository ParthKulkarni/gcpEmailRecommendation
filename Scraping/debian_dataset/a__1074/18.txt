But there is _no_ dispute.  All the maintainer has to do is to close the ITS
bug within a month.  Thus, if the bug remains unanswered, there is no one
who would want to dispute the bug.  And not even a temporary incapacitation
is a problem: for an ITS to be filed, you'd need to neglect the package
quite a while, thus the package was effectively unmaintained for much longer
than a month.
Involving the TC is a heavyweight process, and is fit for when there's an
actual disagreement.  A disagreement requires two parties, with ITS one of
them is gone.
