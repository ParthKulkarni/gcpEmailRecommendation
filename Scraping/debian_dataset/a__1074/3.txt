Yes, that's sort of true, but not really.  The MIA process doesn't actually determine anything about who a maintains a package.  It determines who is no longer active in the project.  The impact on who the maintainer is is a secondary effect of the MIA process.
Package 'salvaging' is about an involuntary change of maintainer involving someone who is sufficiently active in the project not to be MIA.  It's fundamentally different.
I suspect it's constitutionally sufficient for the TC to approve the salvaging process as long as the process allows them to resolve related disputes.  I'm not trying to shoot down the concept, but we need to be mindful of the responsibilities of different roles in the structure of the project as it is established.
