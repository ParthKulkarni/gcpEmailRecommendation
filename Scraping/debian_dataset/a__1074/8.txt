For me personally, I guess not, mostly because I don't maintain many
packages which follow this pattern. But this was more of a global view
comment, not as how it might affect me.

I guess the root problem is that everything else in the proposal seems
so concrete and clear-cut, all other conditionals for triggering the
process are very explicit, except for this one, which seems fuzzy and
loop-holey, which gives the impression that in contrast to the other
points there's much room for the initiation process on conditions that
might not be appropriate.
Also while this (dealing with such bugs) might be fine for someone who
maintains few packages, consider, say, something like a huge team, like
perl :), that might batch changes for many packages and perform uploads
just once per release or similar. Also my feeling is that if we have to
keep bugs open as a notice for something that might actually be a normal
pattern, that looks like the conditions are not correct.
In comparison, what gregor proposed (the simple version) in the other
thread, while less explicit, seems apparently more internally consistent
and less loop-holey! Because it just gives some rough guidelines and
delegates to the initiator's good judgement. I'm not sure that's better,
though because in cases like this, where these might be contentious
issues perhaps we'd better be more explicit than implicit, dunno. Hope
that this helps explain the issue I see. :)
Thanks,
