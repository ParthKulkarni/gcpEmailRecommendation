I asked on the freeradius-users list, if there is an easy way to log the
SSL/TLS version a client uses during the PEAP/TTLS handshake, to get a
better understanding of the situation on my universities wireless
networks, but unfortunately this was not easily possible.

It would be really interesting to gather some long term statistics about
this to see a trend of the adoption of newer TLS versions over time.
Gr√º√üe,
Sven.
