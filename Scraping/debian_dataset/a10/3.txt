Fortunately, our default MTA uses gnutls, but it's not nice to screw postfix
users.
In the real world, refusing mails from even one customer or business
partner, no matter how pants-on-the-head-retarded their mail setup is, is
simply not an option.
Their answer will be "your server is broken as my mail works elsewhere, it's
your fault", no matter how much you preach TLS safety.
Meow!
