The usage of TLS in the wild does not rely on you. Neither its does to
Debian, IMHO.
Now, when talking about the users of Debian I'm fine with such
statements. Actually, I'm not a user of Debian myself for good reasons.

What do you mean by *you*? The users? They don't seem to have any
choice.

Well, there is a lot of problems in the world. Not being able to use a
protocol anymore because a maintainer decided to disable the feature can
be one of them.

So this policy is neglecting the users needs in the hope this will force
third-parties to move...

There is a gap between forcefully disabling a protocol and disabling it
with the possibility to manually re-enable it when really required.
If we even admit that the "forcefully disallow protocols for our users"
policy is a good alternative to change the world, it's well known that
all the providers won't upgrade any time soon. So, the Busters users are
taken hostage.

Sure. This does not prevent from providing a plan B: manually re-enable
a "won't be supported anymore" feature.
I tend to think that in the end this is all about consideration to your
users. Of course, it's up to you to go your own way.
