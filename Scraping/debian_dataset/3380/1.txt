I've started work on updating the packages. With that I've noticed
that two of the new upstream archives have 'autom4te.cache'
directories in them.  They get cleaned up during a package build
attempt but then the build complains about upstream changes & errors
out.  I'm not sure how to deal with this but one thing I'll do is that
I'm going to ask upstream about those directories being present.
Note that I can't push my changes as I am not yet a member of the
citadel projects on salsa.  (I'm a DM, and I'm rjclay-guest on salsa.)
