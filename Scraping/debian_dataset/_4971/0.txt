Oh, I didn't even know/remember that feature, that's really useful!

It looks like your patches only copies it to the SUBDIR, but I think it
would be safer to copy it twice in both /boot/dtbs/VERSION/FDTFILE as
well as /boot/dtbs/VERSION/SUBDIR/FDTFILE, as different versions of
u-boot may support inside or outside the SUBDIR.
That said, bootscr.uboot-generic *should* fall back to the
/boot/dtb-VERSION or /boot/dtb symlinks, after it fails to find the file
based on $fdtfile, which *should* work around the problem entirely, even
if a bit ugly.

Overall, I like this idea, but not all boot scripts work the same
way... they may not even load a .dtb at all.
Also, using what's requested from the bootloader would help if you've
transferred the image to a compatible system that loads a different .dtb
(e.g. wandboard-revc vs. wandboard-revb).

Which is why I'd like to implement a feature to copy all .dtb files for
boards with a sufficiently large /boot ... but it's a bit late in the
freeze to implement such a thing...
