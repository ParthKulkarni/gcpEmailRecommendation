Well this kind of patch is not mergeable upstream, so we will have to
keep it forever. What would be wrong in using a supported value for 
the debian-installer locale? It should only be a dozen of lines to
change.
Alternatively would it make sense to install the C.UTF-8 locale from
libc-bin in libc6-udeb?
