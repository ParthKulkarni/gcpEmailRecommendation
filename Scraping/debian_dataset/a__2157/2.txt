I apologize if coming across as snide.  Or rude or insensitive.
I have no doubt that Jeremy has thought through his question and the 
options available to him in this matter, and that Jeremy has done a 
great deal of good work for Debian and is likely to continue to do so.
My response was not intended as some kind of personal attack on Jeremy, 
it was solely uttered out of concern for Debian.
Please do believe and respect that I have _also_ given this matter quite 
some thought.
Regards,
 - Jonas
