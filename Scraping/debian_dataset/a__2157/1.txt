Launchpad doesn't need any changes here.  It's perfectly possible to get
Launchpad to accept a downgrade: while it won't accept it via the normal
upload path, Ubuntu archive admins can do it by way of a delete followed
by a copy.
Doing so for binary packages would be contrary to Ubuntu archive policy
for the obvious reason that apt clients would then be stranded on an old
version that compares greater than all current versions.  Doing so for
source packages would be unconventional but could be discussed.
