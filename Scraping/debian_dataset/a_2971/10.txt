Every repo on alioth will get archived and disabled on the weekend. Alioth is
gone at the end of the weekend. 
There it doesn't make sense to keep anything on alioth which is also on
salsa. Everything else gets archived for historical purposes. 
Every repo that is on salsa and alioth will just waste ressources on the
archive host.
So *please* delete everything that has been migrated other services.
I hope that makes things clearer.
