Sure, perfectly fine with me. If I don't open a p-u bug after
the release of Stretch myself, feel free to ping me.
(Btw. I also just noticed from reading the code that the
additional time is not the only side-effect: it will clutter
every new installation with a small file in /etc/iscsi. The
file is harmless, and won't cause any problems, but I wanted
to mention it so you know about it.)
