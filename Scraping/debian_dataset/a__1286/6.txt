Oh, I had been wondering a bit about this, since timing seemed to have
changed a bit with my automated tests; but I ended up bumping the max
delay, thinking the initial setting was borderline, instead of
investigating.

I think it would be best to postpone considering such a fix for the
first point release, instead of aiming for r0. Let's look at this once
r0 is out, so as to avoid generating noise for the release team? I've
added an item on my d-i task list so that I don't forget about it.
Thanks for your input!
