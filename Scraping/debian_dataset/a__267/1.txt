I think this is the first time I've ever toyed with the serial
console and kvm, but at least editing the 'Install' menu option and
adding “ console=ttyS0,9600,n8” at the end of the command line lets
me have serial in ctrl-alt-3.
I'm not sure what you proposed above should work. At least it
doesn't when trying with the latest 7.11.0 image. Are you sure
you're not missing any parameters?
