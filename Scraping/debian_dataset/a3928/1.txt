Hi Geert,
This sounds like you're seeing exactly the same problem as Helen
reported (and demonstrated to me) in #905319. The onboard nvme disk on
the XPS 15 isn't properly mapped in the firmware so that new EFI boot
variables don't work. grub-install adds an entry pointing at the first
"hard disk" which should normally work on most machines.
Pending a firmware fix, there is a workaround - install to the
removable media path too. See
  https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI#Force_grub-efi_installation_to_the_removable_media_path
for more information.
