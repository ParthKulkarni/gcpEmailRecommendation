My intent is different, but maybe while building the installer you can
use a configuration file or the like to give some inputs to the
installer ? A debian-installer might be able to help there.

Hermann are you suggesting to build a Debian Kernel following
these instructions:
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/kernel/linux.git/tree/debian/README.source?h=sid
You'd then put some modules as built-in and use the udeb to build a new
installer with a custom kernel ?
I don't see how you can "use it for installation" otherwise.
Thanks for the idea, I think it might solve my problem. Just need to
figure out how to do it now :)
