Good point -- does this perhaps point towards needing to make the
setting of auto=true delay the asking of the hostname and domain until
after preseeding, as with the keyboard/locale questions?
I know it's a bit odd to ask those questions after the network comes up,
but if one has set auto=true then you either need to set those on the
command line or in an initrd preseed say, or you need the network to
come up without them being set, so it makes sense to delay the
processing of those settings until later -- IIRC this is something that
is a bit broken anyway, since preseeding the hostname doesn't do what
one might hope some of the time (unless that's been fixed while I wasn't
paying attention -- I'm pretty sure it used to be the case that the
hostname on the target would not be changed if one set these during
network preseeding).
Cheers, Phil.
