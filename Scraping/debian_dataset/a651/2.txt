It seems there were no functional changes between both versions, only
translation updates plus an extra CHANGES file (which looks like the
last changelog entry). BTW, Christian, a git push seems to be missing.
If you want to check the behaviour, see $savekbdfile and $TMPFILE in the
setupcon script.
