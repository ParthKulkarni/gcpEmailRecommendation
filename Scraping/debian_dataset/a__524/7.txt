Hi,
I am trying to figure out if someone knows about the whereabouts of the
Debian ACE packaging team. Johnny Willemsen contacted me because he had
problems to get in touch with the ACE team[0]. He is part of the upstream
team and is interested in getting the package in shape again. It
currently suffers from one RC bug (#853299).
The members of ACE team are:
- Thomas Girard <thomas.g.girard@free.fr>
  last activity Nov 2015 (PGP upload)
  Martin Borgert orphaned omnievents which they both co-maintained.
- Pau Garcia i Quiles <pgquiles@gmail.com>
  last activity Nov 2016 (PGP upload)
- Marek Brudka <mbrudka@aster.pl>
  last activity Oct 2010 (BTS)
Does anyone have an idea about their current status?
