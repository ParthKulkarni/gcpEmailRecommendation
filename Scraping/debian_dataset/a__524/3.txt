Hi,
When looking at the current big list (see
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?repeatmerged=no&src=ace) I
think the following bugs can be updated when x.4.5 has been uploaded to
debian
* 853299: gcc7 is now suppoirted out of the box
* 823592: fixed upstream
* 851424: openssl 1.1 is now supported
* 628571: TAO isn't packaged anymore, maybe make this bug invalid?
* 859350: fixed in packaging
* 227132: TAO isn't packaged anymore, maybe make this bug invalid?
* 785728: we have a lot of builds on ACE, haven't seen this lately,
probably fixed upstream
