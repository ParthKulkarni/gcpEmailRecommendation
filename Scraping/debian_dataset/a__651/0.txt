Package: console-setup
Version: 1.167
Severity: normal
Updated from 166 to 167 and when verifying changes in /etc/ noticed
there was only one change, in console-setup/cached_setup_keyboard.sh:
---8<---
-loadkeys '/etc/console-setup/cached_UTF-8_del.kmap.gz' > '/dev/null' 
+loadkeys '/tmp/tmpkbd.31u83e' > '/dev/null'
--->8---
File in /tmp/, named tmpkbd and with (random) extension that looks
like one from mktemp? And before it was a file in /etc/ with
understable name? Suspicious.
Running the script by hand returns the obvious "cannot open file
/tmp/tmpkbd.31u83e" while calling the other version of loadkeys
invocation works fine.
Prediction is that in next boot it will complain too and require
manually calling with the proper kmap file.
Also while tracking the calls for boot sequence, found that usage line
for /etc/init.d/keyboard-setup.sh and console-setup.sh forgot the .sh
extension (two mount*.sh forgot the extension too, but that would be
for another report). Most scripts properly report their name with .sh
and one even just uses $0 so it reacts automatically to however it was
called. Minor cosmetic details.
Thanks,
GSR
