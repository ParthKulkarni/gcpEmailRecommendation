oh, and you seem to miss #856720 which is a open RC bug.

being in a freeze and seing 5-6 uploads trying to get the package in
shape while introducing more RC bugs doing so is also very demotivating for
the release team, who's job it is not, to teach you good packaging,.
Really, this "userdel -r diaspora" pointed out in the first reply
to this thread is again, horrible. Granted, it's not as bad as #858521
(which you *introduced* during freezeâ€¦) but: imagine your username aint 
pirate but diaspora and you try out this package and purge itâ€¦
Finally, as Lars pointed out, running /usr/lib/diaspora-common/scripts/diaspora-download.sh
in postinst is both horrible from a security point of view, plus it's a
policy violation, so that's two more RC bugs.
I'm sorry for all the work you put into this, but I'm absolutly *thankful*
to the release team for kicking this package out of Stretch.
