Hello Yao Wei,
Thank you for working on this.

David Pr√©vot and I looked into this during DebCamp.  You can find our
attempt on the webext branch of ublock-origin's alioth repository.
We thought it would be better just to have all packages use the prefix
webext-, installing to something like /usr/share/webext/foo, and then
create a symlink into /usr/share/firefox if the extension works in
Firefox, and into /usr/share/chromium if the extension works with
Chromium.
Do you think this would work?
