Thanks for sharing. When I learned about the ‚Äúpostpone‚Äù variant years
ago, it kind of changed my life:
 - Write mail.
 - Postpone it.
 - Do something else.
 - When getting back to the topic, write a fresh mail without even
   looking at the old one.
 - Once a year, remember you postponed mails. Deleting them without
   reading them again is what works best for me; no need to get angry
   again, or sad at having been angry.
Cheers,
