Dear Gregor,
Thank you for clearing the confusion and also introducing me to use
apt-listbugs with versions as well. I didn't know it could do that (or
maybe I overlooked). Anyways, it's nice to know that there shouldn't
be a problem as far as wpagui and wpasupplicant is concerned when
upgrading from squeeze.
Till later.
