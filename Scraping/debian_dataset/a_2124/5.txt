There are aspects of our community's identity that go beyond the text of
those documents, though those aspects could still be construed as
interpretations of clauses in those documents.
In this thread, we have seen views that are fiercely anti-promotion, and
views that are in favour of very radical modernisations to our site.
The community consensus seems to be that we want to promote ourselves,
but we care more about providing quality information than do the people
who designed sites like lxde.org (sorry to keep using that example).
This consensus position is itself a value of our community, and an
aspect of its identity.
