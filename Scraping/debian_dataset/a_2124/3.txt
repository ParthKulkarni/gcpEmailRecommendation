Debian say claim to be "The universal operating system". It should not 
be
Design and advertising are one and the same, manipulating the mind 
through
the image to obtain consent. We are stuck in this rotten atmosphere 
since
I did not want to talk about philosophers, it would have been 
pretentious.
But you understood the message. Yes, beautiful, truth and being are one 
thing.
I think that Debian does not especially need aesthetic beauty research 
because
it already has the accents of truth for it, and since it is one the same 
thing
because Debian already has real principles that have attracted thousands 
of people.
What I really want to say is that the original message calls for an 
aesthetic
among others that is the one of the moment, but that is not what we 
should aim
for as this kind of beauty does not fit the timeless beauty of the 
principles
of Debian since it is so quickly obsolete.
