You talked about automation.  Such tasks usualy run on a pre-defined
system.  So I don't know why you need to have the credentials for this
task on many computers.

You can always use the encryption key functionality to decrypt the

Yes, you restrict token to the job, so you don't need to copy them
around.

We usualy deal with problems by describing them and not try to fit a
