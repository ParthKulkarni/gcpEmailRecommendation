Dear Debian Developers and Maintainers,
I have filled an ITP for the Nix package-manager [1]. During packaging
lintian pointed out [2] that Nix relies on a non-standard-toplevel-dir.
The Nix package-manager keeps by default all packages in the path
`/nix/store`. In principal this path can be changed, but it would make
it impossible to use pre-build binaries from the standard Nixpkgs
channels [3].
The problem are retained dependencies. A package keeps references to
a package it depends on. And this references contain the absolute
path (including `/nix/store`).
Section 5.5.3 and 6.1 of the PHD thesis "The Purely Functional
Software Deployment Model" [4] on which Nix is based gives some more
insight.
I would like your advise on how to proceed.
Thanks in advance.
Regards
Kai Harries
