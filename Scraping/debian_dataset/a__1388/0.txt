Normally the debian installer loops over all sound boards it finds, to
prompt the user for which one he wants to use. If that doesn't work it
means there is a problem with the driver of your board. It's no use
trying to force using a given device: it already does so for each board
which was discovered.
So unfortunately it's most probably a bug in sound drivers, and more
information is needed to determine how to fix it, see
https://wiki.debian.org/accessibility#Debian_installer_accessibility
for the amixer commands to get output of, and the content of
/proc/asound/cards. Perhaps you can do so from some other image with
which sound does work, be it knoppix adriane or such.
