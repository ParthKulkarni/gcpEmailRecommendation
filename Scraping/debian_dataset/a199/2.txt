Most users don't know what ntpdate is, either.

*I* would assume that when a user sets the system clock through a high-
level UI, such as GNOME provides, that is the most accurate source of
information and the RTC should also be set.  But I would not assume
that the system clock *remains* very accurate after that point, which
is what the flag in question is supposed to indicate.
I would also expect that users running command-line tools to set the
time, such as ntpdate, have enough technical understanding to
distinguish the system clock and RTC.
