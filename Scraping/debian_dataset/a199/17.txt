It would seem reasonable for ntpdate to clear that flag so I opened a

Thanks for that security tip, I'm tempted to get rid of some ntpd
instances now, however a few more questions come to mind before I rush in:
- for a site with several machines, should they all be querying
pool.ntp.org servers directly or can any other local ntp daemon be
relied on?
- this discussion also reminded me of the clock drift issues[2] for
Xen virtual machines / guests / domU systems.  I don't know if such
problems still exist with modern hypervisors and kernels but I had
encountered them in the past and had been running ntpd on each VM and
then they all appeared to behave.  Does this apply to LXC, KVM or any
other environment?  What are best practices for this today, does
systemd-timesyncd solve everything and do people need to manually
tweak any sysctl like /proc/sys/xen/independent_wallclock any more?
Maybe some of this could go in the wiki too if it is still necessary.
