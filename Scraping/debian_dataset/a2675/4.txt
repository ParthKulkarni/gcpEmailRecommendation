Hi Patrick,
I haven't tried this myself, but try passing http_proxy= as a kernel
command-line argument. IIRC they are converted to environment variables
by the kernel, so if this survives long enough to get to the relevant
process that fetches the preseed file it might work.
http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:3128/
HTH,
Chris
