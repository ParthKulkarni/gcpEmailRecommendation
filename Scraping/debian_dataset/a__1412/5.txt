It depends on the bug. If you want an app to be ported to wayland, then either
the app or the toolkit/framework, as appropriate. If an X app doesn't behave
properly, then XWayland. If you see a WM/compositor bug, then whatever
compositor you are using (gnome-shell/weston/...) ...

There isn't (yet).
