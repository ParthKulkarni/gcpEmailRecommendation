Dear fellow developers,
I have started using GNOME Wayland possibly as my primary session. It
sort of feels different from the default X11 GNOME session in surprising
ways (overall rather more comfortable I would say).
I am seeing issues in some software that don't seem usable at all in
GNOME Wayland, e.g.:
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=852699
Where is the correct place to report such issues: the individual
affected packages (as I did with the above-mentionned bug), xwayland,
something else? Is there a usertag defined for such issues?
Kind regards, Thibaut.
