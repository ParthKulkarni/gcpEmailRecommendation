Hi,
The d-i translation is now online at Weblate!
https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-installer/
At the moment not all languages are available there though.
I did not add those languages, for which we have active translators that
are working with po files directly.
As I wrote above:
If translators want to switch from editing pure po files to Weblate, let me know.
I can easily add more languages there.
A note on committing changings back to svn.debian.org:
At the moment no files will automatically pushed back to svn.debian.org.
I will do that manually for the beginning.
Holger
