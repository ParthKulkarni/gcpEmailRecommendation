For the tarballs, yes, but for the resulting .debs, no. We are here
talking about 500MB worth of .debs.  Having to upload all of that just
when wanting to add a voice would mean we'd rather avoid adding voices,
which would be unfortunate.

It's not only bandwidth but also disk storage.  The voices that I have
uploaded in the past have basically never changed until the repacking I
have just done, and that I believe won't do again.  If we were to have a
common packaging, it'd mean (currently) 500MB of voice data per Debian
distribution (since I guess we'd want to upload at least one new voice
per distribution, as has been the case in the past releases).

The packages are extremely simple, the fixes have always been very
easily automatized with dch, sed etc.

Well, that becomes a question of taste. We do need separate binary
packages anyway, I don't see how using separate source packages makes it
uglier.
