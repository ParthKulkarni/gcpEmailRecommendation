Yeah, it works. I updated my pu/kernel-cmdline-preseed to use this except
that I dropped one set of useless parenthesis (the one in the middle of
the stack).
And I added a comment explaining the regular expression as this:
# read this as (single-word|var-name=("value"|'value'|unquoted-value))(space|EOL)

I added this as well, although the shell code afterwards already skips
over if the value is determined to be empty.
