win32-loader should be arch:all-rebuilt (aka uploaded) with a versionned 
Build-Depends on the  latest debian-archive-keyring. It would therefore 
also embed the latest versions of all the other binaries its standalone 
version embeds.
It also currently uses httpredir.debian.org as only mirror, so we should 
decide if it makes sense to consolidate onto deb.debian.org for win32-
loader too.
Opinions?
