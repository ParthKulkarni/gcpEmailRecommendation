Reproducibility testing could probably be employed here in order to gain
confidence of the packages in an external repository.  (I see there's a
'reprotest' package that seems meant to help with this.)

There's an available middle-ground, which is to add an additional repository to
the sources.list file and add an apt Pin-Priority in /etc/apt/preferences.d/ for
that repository (of say priority 150) such that any installed packages from the
additional repository get updated, but any not-already-installed packages from
the additional repository aren't automatically used for upgrades.
See 'man apt_preferences' for details.
