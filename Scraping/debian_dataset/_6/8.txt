I bet it does!
I was a bit surprised to find in the docs that there was no "silently
emulate" option in the proc interface, seems my memory was faulty
there.
But it did remind me that on some platforms writing "2" to
/proc/sys/abi/cp15_barrier will enable hw support for these
instructions, since some platforms do support them even thought they
are deprecated. It's certainly worth investigating what your hardware
supports.
