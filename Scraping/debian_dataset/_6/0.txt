There are also scary warnings and discussions about the Ethernet port 
being half-broken at 1 Gbps.

On the lower end I strongly recommend the Olimex Lime 2, which is open 
hardware and works well with the mainline kernel and U-Boot from stretch 
(as long as you do not care about 3D, obviously):
https://www.armbian.com/olimex-lime-2/
BTW... I like installing my little ARM systems using debootstrap 
--foreign, but I am unable to do a 100% self-contained installation 
(without using qemu, which would be cheating, or copying the initramfs 
from another system) because the initramfs has not been built yet. 
Do we distribute anyware one that may be used for the first boot?
