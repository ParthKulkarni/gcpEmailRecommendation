This is true.  But it is why the folks promoting reproducible builds
have made tools which can reproduce the build environment.
I think your implication is that the reproducibility is theoretical
and therefore not useful.  I appreciate why you might think that, but
the reproducibile builds folks have made it practically possible, so
it's not true.
