Thanks, I wasn't aware of that thread. :)
Please let reply to this thread once the changes have been done, so I
can mark them as done in my checklist. :)
Minor remark about the wording: "[...], allowing to download packages
from https mirrors.", perhaps consider "[...], enabling download of
packages from https mirrors."   (From experience, the English review
team has a thing for flagging "allow to" as being incorrect).
Thanks,
~Niels
