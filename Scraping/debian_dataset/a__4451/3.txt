I had tested that and I wasn't able to reproduce this. Maybe what
happened is you had a build with the build-deb directory, you renamed
it build, and there were stray files from the previous build?
You may want to push your tree to git too (I tried git fetch but found
no new commits there). ;)
Thanks for your swift actions, much appreciated!
Cheers,
