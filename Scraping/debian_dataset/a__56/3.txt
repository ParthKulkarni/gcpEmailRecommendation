Package: apt-setup
Version: 1:0.134
Using additional repositories by preseeding with apt-setup/local0/repository 
and apt-setup/local0/key is currently broken, causing the installation to 
fail with a non-obvious error message at a late stage of the install. The 
reason seems to be that apt-key fails on line 38 of generators/60local, 
since apt requires gnupg to be installed for the attempted operation.
Until recently, base-installer has always pulled in gnupg. Presumably due to 
some other package depending on it. This is no longer the case.
As long as 60local is implemented as is, and the example-preseed.txt 
documents the use of additional repositories, apt-setup should ensure 
installing from additional repositories works.
My undestanding of prepare_gpg_home() in cmdline/apt-key.in of apt is that 
it is an active choice to not have apt itself depend on gnupg, thus making 
it the responsibility of the caller.
I can see that there is a wishlist bug #877013 addressing a similar issue. 
Don't know more about it's status than the bug report reveals, but would 
consider this is a separate issue of higher severity since it now actually 
breaks functionality rather than merely is about adding more granular 
security controls.
A work around which helped me and might be interesting for other bitten by 
this bug is to add "d-i base-installer/includes string gnupg" to the preseed 
file.
Unfortunately I cannot provide a patch, since I do not fully understand 
which mechanism to use to make a udeb of the installer environment pull in a 
package in the base-install of the target system. None of the packages I 
could suspect to be changed have seen any recent relevant commit activity, 
so I can't figure out exactly what made this break. It should not make much 
difference since it likely has been a missing dependency in apt-setup all 
along.
