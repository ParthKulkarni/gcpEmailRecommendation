apt-key(8) has some scattered hints.
Beware of the keybox format which apt does not support. apt-key checks
the first byte of a (supposed to be) binary file and if its unexpected
skips with a warning (see is_supported_keyring). You could potentially
use a similar logic. It also includes code to convert asc to gpg format.
Both was suggested/vetted by the gpg maintainer(s).
If I could be wishing for something, I would go with ASCII armored files
(as that avoids problems with binary conffiles, keybox and other vanity
formats, â€¦) and Signed-By in sources rather than /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d.
If I had a djinni instead it would be something more along the lines of
the various alternatives which are proposed every so often, but never
actually materialize.

We haven't figured out a sensible scheme for file naming either which
was one more reason to not try to make 'apt-key add' work without gpg.
