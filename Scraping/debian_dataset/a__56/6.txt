So what's the current contract with apt? ASCII-armored files need to go
into .asc and binary files into .gpg? Is the right way to infer ASCII
armor to grep for the preamble? Also right now we discard the file name
of the key fetched, is that something we'd want to preserve?
(I sort of agree that we should drop files into the right place, on the
other hand the fix would be "apt-install gnupg" with the current setup.)
Kind regards
