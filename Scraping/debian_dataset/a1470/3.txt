It doesn't help that the apache docs on the ServerName directive seem to 
use domainname and hostname interchangeably (While the restrictions you 
mentioned only apply to hostnames)
Does this mean it's now impossible to create virtual hosts in apache for 
domain names with underscores?
Unless they've silently added a DomainName directive somewhere this 
change breaks virtual hosts with internationalized domain names too 
since as you mentioned hostnames have to be /[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?/i
Since ServerName has historically acted as it takes a domainname I 
imagine it would be smarter for upstream to change the docs to use the 
word Domainname rather than change the functionality to break a few 
million domains.
