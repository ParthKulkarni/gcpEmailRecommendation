Hi Diego,
(adding kernel maintainers to the loop for the fix, and release team for
comments about the extra package I think we would need to fix this.)

Looking at linux.git, it seems this driver is built as a module, but there's
no i2c-modules udeb for armhf. I don't think this bug is critical enough to
have a linux upload before r0 (unless something is in the works already),
but I'm a little concerned that postponing a bug fix for r1 wouldn't be too
niceâ€¦Â Adding a new binary package in a point release feels wrong. :(
