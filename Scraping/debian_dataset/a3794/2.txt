Since the -dev package doesn't change name this can only happen in the
SO-name transition phase, and a binary rebuild of the reverse
dependencies will fix this since it will pull in only the latest
version, and AFAIK the release team scheduls this kind of rebuild of
reverse deps when a so-name transition is done.

Well, openssl has/had two different -dev package, which made this
problem possible.

But it would have meant for the user that they can notonly co-install
packages that depend on the same library version.
Best,
