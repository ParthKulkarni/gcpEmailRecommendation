It is probably worth checking the system's current time to see if it is
before the date that apt was built (or rather apt's SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH)
and/or the date that the medium that is being booted was built (if
that's available) or similar, to check if we're living in the past.
If that's the case, these errors about future signatures are really not
worth reporting.
It might also be good to then try hard to get sensible time somehow, but
that's not apt's problem to solve.  Perhaps the right thing to do in d-i
is to check for being in the past, try to find a decent time source, and
if that fails then set a flag that could be used to decide to disable
the check when we come to running apt.
Cheers, Phil.
