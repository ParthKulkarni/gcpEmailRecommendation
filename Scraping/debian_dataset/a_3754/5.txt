I have started working on adding webhook support to KGB, which is the
tool that many projects are already using for years.
Ideally, this would be a service plugin in gitlab, so projects could use
templates for configuration, and to be able to configure what is now
done in the kgb.conf file. But to get this out quicker, I will just add
simple webhook parsing.
On a side note, I only learnt about the idea to replace KGB with irker
last week, during the CCC congress. I think that contacting the KGB
maintainers beforehand would have been a better way of dealing with this.
