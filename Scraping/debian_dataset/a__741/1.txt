Except for the ifname/systemd part (discussion is ongoing on -doc, see
https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2017/04/msg00039.html),
nobody complains about my proposal.

Reading the last Bits from the release team,
(https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/04/msg00013.html)
secure boot is not ready, so I leave this sentence here.
So, I've updated the release notes (without ifname) as r11449.
Thanks.
Baptiste
