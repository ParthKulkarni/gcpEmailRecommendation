Hello,
This is what I have so far; it is certainly inadequate.  CCing -devel
for help answering my technical questions about this patch.

1. Is the 'should not' for the /etc/default practice too strong?  I
   don't know an efficient way to find out how many packages this would
   make buggy.  But given that we have very strong reasons against the
   old practice, we might want to use a 'should not' regardless.
2. Do we need to include any text saying *why* the /etc/default practice
   is a bad idea?  I couldn't come up with a succinct way to state it.
   In general, I think we can err on the side of not including the text,
   since we have policy bugs that document the reasons.
3. The maintscript snippet I have added is not right because it will
   disable the daemon every time the package is updated.  Unfortunately,
   the postinst doesn't know whether this is a new installation, or an
   upgrade.
   An alternative is to require the package maintainer to set the
   correct LSB headers and systemd unit file configuration values such
   that the daemon is not autostarted (in the former case, setting the
   daemon not to be started at any runlevel).  But I think this would
   prevent the local system administrator from enabling the service with
   a simple `update-rc.d package enable`, which is the whole point of
   all this.
   I looked at dh_installinit(8) and update-rc.d(8) and I couldn't get
   them to generate a postinst that does what I want.  It seems you're
   expected to use all three of these:
       dh_systemd_enable --no-enable
       dh_systemd_start --no-start
       dh_installinit --no-start
   but then after a reboot, a sysvinit system will start the daemon,
   AFAICT.
