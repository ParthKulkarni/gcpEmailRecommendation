This has a bug: after the first rune, but before this second, starting
the daemon is enabled.  (This is a regression compared to the previous
approach.)
To make this work correctly, I think we need a new update-rc.d
mechanism which provides, in one go, the equivalent of
  update-rc.d DAEMON defaults && update-rc.d DAEMON disable
Something like
  update-rc.d DAEMON add-disabled
maybe.

On sysvinit systems, using update-rc.d disable/defaults are rather
more awkward:
 * Enabling and disabling cannot, in practice, be conveniently made
   without using the update-rc.d tool.
 * Enabling and disabling generates a tremendous amount of noise in
   /etc (especially visible when using etckeeper).

How about this text:
  Setting a value in /etc/default/PACKAGE is nowadays troublesome
  because supporting that pattern is very hard due to inflexibility in
  systemd, which is usually the default init system.
This also makes it clear that this pattern is perfectly fine if for
any reason the package does not support systemd.

This should also be fixed with a new update-rc.d rune.

I can't speak to the behaviour of systemd, but I think the
  update-rc.d add-disabled
operation I propose would, for sysvinit systems, do the follow:
1. Are there already rc*.d links for DAEMON ?  If so, do nothing.
2. If not, create them in the way that  defaults && disable
  would have done.
