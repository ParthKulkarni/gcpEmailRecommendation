I don't really agree with this -- I've disliked this approach (and there
were debian-devel threads against it) from long before systemd was
written.  The explanation I'd give is that:
    Setting a flag in /etc/default/PACKAGE hides from the init system
    whether or not the daemon should actually be started, which leads to
    inconsistent and confusing behavior: ``service <package> start`` may
    return success but not start the service, services with a dependency
    on this service will be started even though the service isn't running,
    and init system status commands may incorrectly claim that the service
    was started.
