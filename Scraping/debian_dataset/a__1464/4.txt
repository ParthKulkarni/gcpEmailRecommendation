Hello Sean Whitton,
Thanks for your work on this. Hopefully you'll find something in my
comments inlined below of any use...

I can't help myself but repeat that I'd prefer seeing more passive
wording eg. instead of "instead add to your postinst" use something
like "the postinst should contain" + a footnote about this normally
being added by dh_...
Manually written maintainer scripts should be avoided and I've seen
people being "fooled" by taking policy literally before. (Maybe this
deserves a section of its own?)

Not in my opinion, no.

Any maintainer being hit by policy extremists have two options:
1. Take the opportunity to fix the package to follow best pracises.
2. Postpone by saying "should not" is not "must not" (and lower severity),
   plus "patches welcome" ofcourse.
I think that's good enough.

I don't think elaborating on all the ways something can be done
incorrectly is nessessary. Should not be too hard for anyone interested
in the reason to find out atleast one reason either by thinking it
through by themselves or by googling for past discussions.
If anything I'd rather see helpful suggestions (in footnotes?) on how
a proper cleanup should be done. (Convert admin changes on upgrades,
use debian/*.maintscript to rm_conffile)
