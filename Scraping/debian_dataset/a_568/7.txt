No. D can also build shared libraries even. The problem is that you
can only combine libraries and binaries built with the same D compiler
and the same D compiler version.
This results in problems:
If I have an application A that depends on (shared or static) library
B, and we update the D compiler that was used to build both components
initially, and then do an upload of application A, we will get linker
errors. Since A is now built with the newer compiler and B still has
the ABI used with the old D compiler, a mismatch happens.
So, if a new D compiler is made available in the archive, we would
need to ensure all D stuff gets rebuilt in order.
If source code is shipped, the code is only compiled once, so we
wouldn't run in that issue (but doing that is maybe no so nice?).
Cheers,
