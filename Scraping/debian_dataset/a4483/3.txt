unfortunately I can't simply switch over to libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev for the
kicad package as some of the applications become mostly unusable if the
GTK+3 version of libwxgtk library is used. Upstream is working on this
problem but I fear were won't be a GTK+3 ready source of kicad before
the full freeze of Buster.
KiCad is partially also depending on wxpython3.0. But here there are
only GTK+3 linked binaries currently available and by this I need to
disable a useful scripting feature (used for AddOns) in KiCad since the
upload of 3.0.2.0+dfsg-7 [1].
For wxwidgets you are providing also "legacy" GTK+2 versions of the
libraries. Would this also be possible for wxpython3.0? Currently all
downstream distros are in the same position as me for the KiCad package.
