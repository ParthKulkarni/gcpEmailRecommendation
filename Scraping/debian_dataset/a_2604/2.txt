For the postinst, you can rely on the updated init-system-helpers being
at least unpacked (which should be enough, because i-s-h is Essential,
so it's required to provide its core functionality while merely unpacked
and not yet configured).
The difference for Pre-Depends is that it would give you the ability to
assume that i-s-h has been configured (fully installed) before your
postinst runs. I don't think you need that here.
In the postrm, you can't normally rely on having your package's
dependencies still installed, but init-system-helpers is Essential so
it should still be there, and we don't officially support downgrades so
i-s-h should still be at least the required version.
Most packages do the more involved parts of their removal in the prerm.
Is that feasible here?
