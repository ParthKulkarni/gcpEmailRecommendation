Well spotted.

Debian packging git tools could perhaps suppress these options, or
warn about them.
I know that dgit and git-deborig already take care to suppress
.gitattributes.  I hadn't considered the eol configurastion
parameters.  Maybe they need to be squashed or warned about too -
although unlike with .gitattributes, the default git configuration is
safe.

I think you should not set any of these options.  I disagree with the
discussion in that article surrounding the suggestion to use
core.autocrlf=input.  Almost no-one should do this on Linux.
In the Debian context, if the orig tarball contains files with cr-lf
line endings, then so must your git tree.  So you must not tell git to
convert things.
If these files with cr line endings are a nuisance should probably
complain to upstream.  It is highly unusual to provide a tarball
containing DOS/Windows-format text files.  In the meantime you'll have
to repack the tarball :-/.

Please don't do that.  (I don't think it would work, anyway.)

This applies even if you are not intending to upload with dgit.
But, of course, you should upload with dgit.
Good luck.
