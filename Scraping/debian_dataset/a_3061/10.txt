Not exactly software, but the kind of support that software provides:
braille, speech, and which software because that makes a technical
difference in the quality of the information provided.

The problem is that "abilities" is a terrible beast to define. "sighted"
for instance does not mean anything, since there is an extremely wide
range of sightedness, which can't for instance actually be reduced a
single "quality" scalar value as opticians define. "being able to read
written braille", "being able to hear speech synthesis", "being able to
read a zoomed display", however, does mean something to users, thus the
accessible-via tags.
