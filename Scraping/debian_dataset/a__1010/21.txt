bsdiff was specifically invented for patching binaries. See the
evaluation I posted a (few) hour(s) ago. It's used succesfully by
FreeBSD, Chrome, Android, Apple App Store, and other places.
Chrome switched to courgette meanwhile, which basically just 
disassembles the code and unifies offsets before passing it
to bsdiff.
Especially for security and stable updates, as opposed to new
(major) upstream versions it makes a substantial difference
(93% savings for the firefox 55.0-1 to 55.0-2 release, from 38
 MB down to 2.4).
