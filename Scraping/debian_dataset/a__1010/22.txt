Isn't there kind of a universal issue that tar and compression happen
sort of in the wrong order?  Wouldn't it make more sense to make files
that were .gz.tar (ie. compress the files individually, then have an
index into them via tar.)  Then tar works perfectly well for
extracting individual files without having to download the entire
thing.  For people who want the entire file, no problem.  For people
who want to minimize client side storage, they can fetch byte ranges
of files to extract the Table of contents of files.
The delta dpkg's are just the .gz.tar of the new files. tar already
has --append, that might be used to just add the delta's to the
existing files, so they become a single dpkg that contains multiple
versions.
Once you can seek (and remotely use byte ranges) there is a whole lot
of options, and it is compression after the index is built that takes
all those options away.
