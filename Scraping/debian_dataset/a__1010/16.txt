That way gives a lower compression ratio, especially when you have a

files. Or a bunch of plain text files.
Also of course there don't exist any good tools to create or extract 
such archives, but that could be fixed (afio exists, but it's non-free).
Alsoâ€”if I'm remembering correctly, tar has no table of contents, I think 
listing a tar file is done by reading all the individual file headers, 
which are spread throughout the file.
