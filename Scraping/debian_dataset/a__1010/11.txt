o in spite of being the *default*, it isn't that universal, and in
any event, we can just decide to change the default, no? One can say
to people with bandwidth limitations, that their apt settings should
not delete packages after receipt, so that they can be used as the
basis for updates.  And these types of settings would appear to be
rather common already, so it isn't a huge change.
It strikes me as much simpler and lower to add zsync to the current
repo/apt tools, and that asking clients to do some caching to support
it is reasonable.
