If we make it so that the only way to mark a test failure as
non-critical is to hack the test suite to exit zero anyway, we would
make it much less convenient to run non-critical tests on
ci.debian.net.  Maintainers could no longer look for 'fail' to see
whether their non-critical tests have failed: they would have to open up
the test output.
I agree with the principle that test failures should be RC by default.
I think we need an additional field in d/tests/control to mark
individual tests as non-critical (this wouldn't really help Ole's 9000
tests package though).
