Aye.

Most packages don't have such a volume of changes, so manual would be ok.
If there's any automation, it would need to handle _both_ age and size,
as a size limit appropriate for almost any other package would cut the
kernel too short -- we'd want changes at least until oldstable.

I gave it a try -- and it appears that, after excluding changelogs over 64KB
gzipped, gzip->xz reduced the total size only from 20M to 19M.  Not worth
the hassle -- xz has a slow start.
So trimming largest changelogs would be enough.
Meow!
