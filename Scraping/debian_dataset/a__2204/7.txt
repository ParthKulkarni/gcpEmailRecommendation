This seems like a bit of a kludge to me.
Do dpkg pre and post hooks work in the context of d-i?
If so, could we not just have a hook for dpkg install that tunes the max
setting down low to avoid the conflict, and turn it back up again
afterwards?
I suspect that that would not result in a significant slow-down of the
sync, while getting rid of the performance issue.
To address the concern about leaving people with still-sync-ing systems
post-reboot (which is not actually prevented by the status quo, I note)
we could add an extra progress screen near the end of the install.
It could track the progress of any remaining md sync (if any), while
pointing out that cancelling out of the screen will do no harm, and will
only mean that the sync that one is waiting for is going to be completed
post reboot.
A preseed variable to allow always skipping past that progress screen
would seem like a reasonable thing to have, if we did all the above.
Cheers, Phil.
