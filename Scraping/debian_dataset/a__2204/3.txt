So, I've been playing with this some more. For people who care deeply
about this now:
 * if you're preseeding your setup, add the following to control RAID
   resync speed
   d-i partman/early_command \
       string modprobe md_mod; echo 2000 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max
   (this will limit resync speeds to a max of 2000 K/sec)
 * if you're running d-i by hand, switch to another console then:
 
   # echo <SPEED> > /sys/block/<MD>/md/sync_speed_max
   after you've created your RAID devices
