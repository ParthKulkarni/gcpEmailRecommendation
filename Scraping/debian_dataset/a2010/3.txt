  Description     : conceived to ease SDN controllers development and deployment
  It was motivated by some gaps left by common SDN solutions. Moreover,
  it has strong tights with a community view, so it is centered on the
  development of applications by its users. Thus, our intention is not
  only to build a new SDN solution, but also to build a community of
  developers around it, creating new applications that benefit from the
  SDN paradigm.
  .
  The project was born in 2014, when the first version of the message
  parsing library was built. After some time stalled, the development
  took off in earlier 2016.
