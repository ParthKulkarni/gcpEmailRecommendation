Alright then.
You mentioned on IRC you were looking into several patches/packages.
I'll probably release d-i over the next few days, so I'm not sure I'll
pick all updates for the next alpha. I'll likely only pick what's
needed, and we'll finish merging things after the release.
(The udeb addition in src:debian-installer shouldn't hurt on its own,
so that should be fine.)
