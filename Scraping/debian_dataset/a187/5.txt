fcgi has a wide variety of glue code, compared to uwsgi, AFAICT.
For example, there is fcgi<->cgi glue in both directions, which works
moderately well.  Also it looks like to use uwsgi you pretty much have
to use their code and buy into their whole application management
framework.
Sometimes that's not what's wanted.
Mind you, I agree that fgci is an unpleasant protocol.
