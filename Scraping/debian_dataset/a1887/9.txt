This is exactly the response why I haven't done this before. I can't
deal with that (apart from the investment of "some effort"). So there is
exactly this risk. On the other hand, the risk is that a (severe, who
knows?) regression migrates because no bug is filed. I agree with Chris'
response and I think most maintainers would rather want it and reassign,
than not getting it. How to judge if Sebastiaans response is that of the
minority or the majority? (And what does that mean for the outcome anyways?)
