The BTS allows you to send a bug against two packages, like this
Package: pa, pb
Version: pa/n.n.n-n
Version: pb/n.n.n-n
Meaning that any of the two packages can resolve the issue. ASFAIK, this
restricted to two packages. Then the bug report may ask the maintainers
of the two packages to sort out who will fix this, and then to reassign
the bug. This is what we did for file overwrite conflicts between
packages [1].
