API has been pretty much stable during last several releases. We introduced
support for properly deprecating API in a backwards-compatible way.
We have been working on stabilizing ABI also. Next release will feature complete
ABI specification, which other compatible implementations will have to follow.
For the time being soversion follows API/ABI changes, so that user applications
won't break.
