These (and also the kernel) are "following an upstream LTS branch",
not "security by upstream releases".
Also for Firefox the new releases on an upstrem LTS branch
(currently 52) are usually not a problem.
The problem with Firefox is the once per year switch to a new
LTS branch, like this year Firefox 52 -> 59.
We aren't doing that for PostgreSQL.
