Thanks. That is what I think anyone reading the package description
needs to know; it's context that simply isn't there.

Making it longer is unavoidable, I think, since the issue as I see it is
the context is missing. So I hope you'll be convinced to add that
context to the package description.
Adding a paragraph like the above one about “the root goal” would be an
excellent start.
