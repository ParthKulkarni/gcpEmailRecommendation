Ah, I see, that would indeed be nice.

Hmm, I hadn't thought that it was the text-only nature of the interface
that is proving off-putting.  I thought it was purely the workflow.
What I described could be wrapped up in a webapp or a desktop GUI --
reportbug already has one.
I think we would need to see how pagure pans out before writing any code
for this, as it might work as some sort of plug-in.
