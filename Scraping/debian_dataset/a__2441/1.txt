The version of db.root in stretch is from Feb 17, 2016.  I suspect that the
comment originates from the fact that I've never done any backports to
stable releases, nor do I particularly want to do so.  Others have been
doing that.

There are a couple of people who are working with me on it, as per the
control file in the package.  Many of the bugs are more minor, or asking
for upstream development, or asking when some feature will be backported
to a stable release.  I tend to not close those bugs out of hand, so the
bug list is both accurate and overstating.
