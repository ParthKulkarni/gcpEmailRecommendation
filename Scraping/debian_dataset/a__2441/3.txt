Hi -devel,
It was just mentioned "en passant" in a conversation at DebConf that
bind9 is shipping a root hint file from 2003.
I had a quick glance at the bug list and saw it was a little larger
than I would have liked for what is clearly a critical piece and
infrastructure. :)
Lamont, can you comment? Anyone interested in helping out hereâ€¦?
Regards,
