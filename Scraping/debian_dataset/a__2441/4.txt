FWIW, the bug about this is #860794. I have just upgraded it to grave
since DNSSEC validation will stop working in October, and it has not
been fixed anywhere.

I'd be willing to help here. I rely on BIND at work and we have started
to roll our own packages anyway, mostly due to 9.11 not making it into
Stretch which we need for DNSSEC key management. But I think bind9
deserves a larger team.
