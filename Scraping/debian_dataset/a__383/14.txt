Plan B in this case are PPAs. If you want to engage in that idea, please
do separately from the -volatile idea.

As Alex laid out, it's mostly just the -backports team handling the NEW
queue. So all of this really is independent from -backports, if another
NEW queue is added (which I do not think is the best idea, but still
possible).
But, I do not think it is possible to start -volatile completely
independently. I am pretty certain there is enough man power to handle
it as a new suite, but on the other hand I am also certain there is not
enough manpower to operate a compelte set of seperate services for it.
In any case, I propose we stop discussing the who and where questions
for a while and concentrate on the what and how. I will collect the
opinions on that, and in a week or two, incorporate them into the
proposal, along with the different possibilities for implementation.
