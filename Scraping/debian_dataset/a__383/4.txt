Please don't name it 'rolling'. This term is used a lot in the sense of
'rolling releases' by other distributions, and also in discussions about
constantly usable testing.
From all names that got suggested so far, 'fastpaced' is the only one
that doesn't have a special meaning in Debian context yet, at least to
my knowledge. That's why I would prefer that one.
Thanks for pushing that effort, Nik and Pirate! I really like the idea
of having a repository that provides newer releases of fast-moving
software built for stable.
Cheers,
