If the libraries in question are DFSG-free themselves, there's no DFSG
issue and you don't need to remove them from the tarball (and we'd
generally encourage not modifying the upstream tarball unnecessarily for
upload to Debian).  The policy about bundling is separate from the DFSG.
Of course it'd be incumbent on whoever's doing the Debian upload to
actually check the licensing status.
