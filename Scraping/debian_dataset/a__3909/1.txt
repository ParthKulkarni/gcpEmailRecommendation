Personally, I would love to receive some advice about this too...
Postponing would be ok if only #817232 wasn't with grave severity...

I took this code unchanged from a comment in BTS.  In order to make it 
easier to track the changes, I've just modified it (in an equivalent 
way).  The new diff is the following:
diff --git a/debian/keyboard-configuration.preinst b/debian/keyboard-configuration.preinst

 #DEBHELPER#
In this way the change becomes obvious --- only the order of execution 
of the commands is changed. Rationale: according to update-rc.d(8) "The 
script must have been deleted already.  If the script is still present 
then update-rc.d aborts with an error message."  This, indeed, means 
that update-rc.d has to be run before dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile.
