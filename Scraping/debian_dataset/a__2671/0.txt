It's been tracked as a regression in the fonts-android package, filed as
#853921. The fix hasn't reached testing yet since it needs a unblock,
which I didn't ask because I wanted to give it more testing.
I've just successfully tested that a basic install in Japanese doesn't
suffer from any regression when switching from the version in testing to
the one in unstable, so I think it's safe to unblock/unblock-udeb it:
    unblock fonts-android/1:6.0.1r16-1.1
    unblock-udeb fonts-android/1:6.0.1r16-1.1
(This took a while since I wanted to finish an automation proof of
concept which lets me record an installation process and replay it
later with a different image; but I'm finally thereâ€¦)
Adding the release team to the loop since I'm slightly reluctant to
unblocking an upload of mine (for a package that isn't maintained by
debian-boot). The (attached) source debdiff shouldn't be too scary
though.
KiBi.
