purposes; maybe someone there will find out what happened before someone
from the installer team does.)
Spotted by victory and mentioned on IRC: we're currently lacking support
for Korean in the installer, since both the menu entry for Korean at the
language selection step and later prompts are only showing the usual
boxes for unknown glyphs. :(
I've just tracked this down as a regression from Stretch Alpha 5 to
Stretch Alpha 6. I'll try and investigate further in a few hours.
