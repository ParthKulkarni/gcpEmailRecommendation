And how do you revert this change? As far as I have understand you canâ€™t 
remove the usrmerge package and have your system in the old state again.
As others in the thread have mentioned they donâ€™t see the risk with new 
installations but with old systems with different admins and third-party 
software.
Right, and it means he has enough to do and doesnâ€™t want to debug the 
usrmerge. I donâ€™t want to have a usrmerge at a dist-upgrade. You donâ€™t 
really know the sequence of the package updates. I think the risk is too 
big to have a partial upgraded system.
If the update of 2% of our systems wonâ€™t work because of failing usrmerge 
I would be asked if Debian is the right distribution.
