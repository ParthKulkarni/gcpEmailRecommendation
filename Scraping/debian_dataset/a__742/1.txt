You don't - it's unstable, for testing these things. If it breaks, you
file a bug and fix the system.

For the sequence of installations, the APT maintainers can shed light
on what the proper plan could be to ensure the usrmerge update happens
at the right time.

There are always unforseen issues to be expected when upgrading. And
at the moment, the only issues that are known when installing the
usrmerge package is when there are different binaries with the same
name in /bin and /usr/bin (or /sbin), and I really don't think that
this is actually a likely scenario.
For these cases though maybe the usrmerge script could ask the admin
on what to do to handle these particular binaries, instead of failing.
I am not strongly advocating for going down this route and actually
migrating all systems on update, but I do not want us to dismiss that
option because we are scared that something might go wrong without
actually knowing that there are unfixable cases where the update might
inevitably break on older installations. Instead, I would rather want
to try out the migration on a bigger scale - potentially and
temporarily break unstable (with a warning, of course), instead of
discussing over and over again potential issues that might not
actually be real and delaying a useful change because of that.
(TBH, for the buster release not switching the buildds to usrmerge and
keep debootstrap/the installer to install in an usrmerged
configuration and then do the final switch during bullseye seems
sensible and I don't see any issue this would cause. Of course if the
reproducible-builds test turns out that we only need to fix a small
amount of packages to make the usrmerge happen on buildds as well,
switching them as well could make sense still)
Cheers,
