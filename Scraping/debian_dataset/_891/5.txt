Do plugins do something which people might not want if present, and
not configured ?  If so then perhaps you want a thing a bit like the
apache mods-enabled scheme: a link farm.
If not, then if it's easy to do I would load all plugins in
    /usr/local/lib/schleuder/plugins
    /usr/lib/schleuder/plugins
(former masking the latter with for with the same name)
