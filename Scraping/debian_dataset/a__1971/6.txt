When we take LVM as default (which is fine for me)
then we should have the courage to have free PE.
So not assign all diskspace.
Advantages:
 * user gets the benefit of LVM: assigning space to a file system
 * quicker install ( no formatting/mkfs of whole disk )
 * no need to shrink /home so space can be used for /srv
Disavantage, in theory:
 * user might miss disk space
