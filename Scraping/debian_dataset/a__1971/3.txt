Yes. I just tried on a stretch mini.iso, if you pick "Guided - use a whole 
disk with LVM" , the default partitioning you get is "All files in one 
partition" :
	254.8 Mb /boot on ext2
	107.1 Gb lvm in which â€¦
		1.1 Gb of swap
		106 Gb /
If we go the LVM by default route, I'd at least consider making the LVM not 
entirely filled, and maybe also swap the default to a separate /home.
