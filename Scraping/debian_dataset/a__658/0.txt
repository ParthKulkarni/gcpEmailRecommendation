Well, the gateway may as well be link-local and not be in the assigned
prefix. That's unfortunately a valid configuration. I wouldn't call
fe80::1 "next router", though. It's not a well-known address. ff02::2
(all routers) would be, in a way. But alas.
I guess the answer here is that if the gateway is in fe80::/10 the route
needs to be added with the interface's name, just like pointopoint does it.
The better setup is to use autoconfiguration and let the router announce
itself. That's how most production IPv6 setups work because the standard
calls for that. But I know that especially providers like Hetzner are
notorious for requiring their users to use a hard-coded fe80::1 default
gateway. (And ifupdown supports this correctly.)
Kind regards
