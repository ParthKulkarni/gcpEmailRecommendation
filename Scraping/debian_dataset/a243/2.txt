I think you are mistaken.
Having seen both the noise on lists, and having on a couple of occasions
also received the same (pre-reply) directly to me, I would think that
what happens is that the spammer lifts the headers from a legitimate
list mail, and replaces its body with their drivel.
The (often rude) replies we see on the lists are almost certainly from
misguided folk who look at the headers and think that they have been
subscribed to one of our lists, and probably think that our lists are a
mechanism for sending spam -- not realising that the mail they got
actually never touched our servers, but simply copied the headers from
a genuine message.
I presume spammers are doing this because it is likely that a lot of
people have our list/bug mail as a significant contribution to the HAM
corpus in their statistical filters.
Sadly, I'm not sure there is much we can do to stop this, since it's all
happening on other people's systems, so the first we hear about it is
when someone becomes confused enough to reply angrily.
Cheers, Phil.
