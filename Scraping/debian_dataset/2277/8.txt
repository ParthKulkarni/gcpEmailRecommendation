Something more important than to point out that besides deciding on
a new name we may also waste more time on deciding how it shall be
pronounced?
In analogy to once upon a time "netscape" being pronounced "mozilla"
we could leave the name "ftp-team" and pronounce it "pinocchio".
No, I am not serious. Thank you for all your good work!
