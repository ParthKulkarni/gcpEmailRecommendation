This DEP isn't about those -- are you saying that it ought to be
extended?

I share this concern, but it is easier for a DD to review a change and
submit it to a next/foo branch than it is for a DD to review an NMU and
try to figure out whether it makes sense for an upload to happen right
now.  So it's more accessible to those without upload rights than NMUs
are at present.

Not all packages have a repo on alioth, so even when alioth runs pagure
and gains PRs, there won't always be a place to submit changes.  With
this DEP, there is a place to submit a next/foo branch for any package
in the archive.
