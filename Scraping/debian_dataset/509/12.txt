What about contributions to non-packaged parts of Debian?
I also don't like having more systems only a subset of contributors can
use.  Having a place where every contributor can publish merge requests
is nicer (one can still have a tool to make it easier to check commit
signatures using the Debian keyrings if one so desires).
