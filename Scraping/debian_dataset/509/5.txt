I forgot to include in the draft an explanation for why this is separate
to DEP-14.  DEP-14's reserved namespaces are meant to be present in
every clone of the repository.  By contrast, DEP-15 reserves a namespace
that should not be present in every clone.
That being said, I don't see why it /contradicts/ DEP-14.  Perhaps you
could explain.

It doesn't require dgit.  I tried to state this as clearly as I could in
the text of the DEP.  dgit-repos is the suggested implementation, but
from the point of view of a DD/DM, it's just a git remote that requires
PGP-signed pushes, which is part of upstream git.
