Couldn't agree more. Porting packages is mostly the task of my work on GNU/Hurd
and being able to issue debian/rules configure, build, binary, clean, etc is
extremely useful. Especially for source packages building a lot of binaries.

See above. Also, when testing if a package can be built twice in a row (not
necessarily for Hurd) it is important. I've encountered several such packages in
the Debian repository (still there).
