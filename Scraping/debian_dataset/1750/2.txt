Me too, but I don't believe the efforts are mutually exclusive.  I spent
time to work towards that goal ten years ago -- see
http://josefsson.org/bcp78broken/ -- however that effort ultimately
failed, although there were partial success in making people aware of
the issue and the IETF Trusts adoption of the BSD license for
code-components of RFCs.  I'd also like to think that I had something to
do with the Unicode consortium changed their license when a similar
concern was brought up with them.

Debian has already compromised on non-free material (the contrib and
non-free sections).  I don't think further compromisation is beneficial.
There are many good proprietary software out there too, but we aren't
including them either.  The primary motivation for me to work on Debian
is the projects' commitment to free software.  Btw, the license for RFCs
does not fulfil your critera above.
