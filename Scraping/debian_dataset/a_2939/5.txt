OK.  I had assumed calling udevadm before udev was configured was wrong,
thanks for the clarification.

Interesting; when I tested libu2f-udev, I ran into cases where the rules seemed
not to be loaded yet, though it might be my testing was wrong.
I will likely keep the explicit reload, though, as I need the script anyhow.

Yes, I wrote a bash abomination which parses the installed rules and issues
a series of `udevadm trigger` calls with the right filters  :)

Thanks again for the feedback, I will just remove the Pre-Depends (and make it
a regular Depends).
Best,
