When discussing the issue with a Debian Med sprint member I've got other
good reasons to even keep the package name despite the fact that its
quite generic.  When looking outside the Debian box other distributions
might package the same software at best under the original name since
they are not that picky about generic names and at worst under different
names which would add more confusion than a less generic name might
avoid.
Furthermore there is some effort called bio.tools[1] (members of this
effort regularly joining Debian Med sprints) who are very keen on all
the metadata that are assembled with Debian packages and can be easily
fetched from UDD.  They consider taking the Debian Source package name
as a key in their database.  While I'm personally not convinced that
this is the best idea we probably should not artificially diverge from
names that would be expceted by potential consumers of our data.
Finally when doing a websearch for freebayes the said project is the
first hit which might be a further arguent to stick to the name that was
choosen by upstream.
Kind regards
    Andreas.
