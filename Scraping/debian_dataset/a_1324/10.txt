I think it should be discussed with upstream, but we have broader namespace considerations that they may not understand or care about.
As long as a package search for freebayes returns this in the result set, I don't think it's critical to have the package name match exactly the upstream name.
Not wearing my FTP team hat for this, consider it as a comment from another DD.
