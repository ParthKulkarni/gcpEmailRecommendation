IANAL, my reading would not be that listing every single copyright 
holder is required by the term "appropriate copyright notice".
But if it is (or is for any other licence), allowing any exception in 
the archive would IMHO be irresponsible:
This would mean distributing something on our mirrors that we consider
to be a copyright violation.
Any affected copyright holder would basically be invited to take legal 
actions against a mirror in a jurisdiction of their choice if they want.
The effects of some university having to pay the costs associated with
signing a cease and desist letter for distributing Debian would not
be pretty.
Has any lawyer been consulted regarding what our legal requirements are?
