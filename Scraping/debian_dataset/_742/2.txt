And how do you revert this change? As far as I have understand you 
can’t remove the usrmerge package and have your system in the old 
state again.
While this is easy done if the system is a VMware VM I know my fellow 
admins well enough that they will simply cancel the update because they 
are not interested in debugging the upgrade process for a single package 
they don’t need.
You know I don’t have doubts that you won’t have problems (or very few) 
if you do a new testing installation. I don’t like Marco’s attitude but 
he is doing a good job. If he has tested his package as he said this 
isn’t the problem.
But Debian/testing doesn’t mean testing on real servers which have 
„survived” different Debian releases, where different admins copied files 
from one location to another, or with some third-party software.
If the update of 2% of our systems won’t work because of failing 
usrmerge I would be asked if Debian is the right distribution.
;-) But while there are no alternative Windows distributions Debian isn’t 
the only one and can be changed.
