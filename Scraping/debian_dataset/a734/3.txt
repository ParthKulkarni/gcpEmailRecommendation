Hi,
Just a minor correction/detail (not very related to the core part of
your post, sorry if it feels off-topic)...
2018-07-19 18:06 Lars Wirzenius:
Just to point out that the arch name is "riscv64" and not "riscv", also
in the blog entry packages would be *_riscv64.deb instead of _riscv.deb.
Why?  There are 32-bit and 128-bit versions of the ISA, 128-bit is a bit
far-fetched today but riscv32 maybe not so, just that nobody was
interested so far.  So the -64 was always considered as part of the name
from the start.
Cheers.
