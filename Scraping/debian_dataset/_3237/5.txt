Yes that's the behaviour I was commenting on in IRC, and which was
obviously being spotted by the jenkins/cucumber setup.
BTW It is possible to run get something like shell access to the running
d-i via its ttyS0 (by putting rather a lot of stuff on the kernel boot
command line), so if that would help I can run tests for you and/or
explain the proceedure.
Cheers, Phil.
