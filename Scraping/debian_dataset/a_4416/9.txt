Hallo everyone,
This is a gentle reminder regarding the Salvaging Process discussion!
For all of those, who did not yet have read the proposal, but still want
to participate in the discussion, please step forward now, as I plan to
start to work on finalizing the text after Saturday, September 1st.
Many have already edited and tweaked the proposed text to correct typos
and weird (for non native speakers) formulations, which is a very good
thing. A BIG THANKS for that!
Cheers,
