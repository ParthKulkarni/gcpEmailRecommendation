Hi Tobi;
I'm not sure it's a good idea to have the definitive criteria for
salvaging in the wiki. I guess partly I'm not too comfortable with the
lack of definition of an process to change those criteria in the
wiki. It's also strange to me to have the salvaging description split
across two locations.  I'd suggest that whatever the "real" conditions
are (even if the concensus is to use a less formal set of conditions
like those given here), that they go in the same document as the
procedure they enable.
