I am trying to install stretch on a computer with 2 btrfs disks and EFI.
Is there a howto to do that ? Did someone success ?
I get problems as soon as the partionning in debian installer. When I 
finish the system does not boot.
What partitions do I need ? I understand that EFI needs an FAT32 EFP.
I find nothing on that in google.
Thanks
