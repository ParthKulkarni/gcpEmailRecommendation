"anti-systemd zealots" Steve, when did you join LP fanclub? When
Ubuntu decided to throw away your upstart and use systemd instead?
Should I remind your votes in CTTE?
Please take your Ubuntu employee hat off and speak as DD.

Do we have runtime systemd detection in all software linked against
libsystemd so it will work properly in absence of systemd? To rebuild
software without libsystemd is the only reliable way to ensure that
non-systemd code pathes are in use.

Steve, you much, much better than anybody else know that the only
political decision made it's a systemd as a default pid 1. Should I
remind how many votes were held until the result satisfying
pro-systemd party was achieved?
