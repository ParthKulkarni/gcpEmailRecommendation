1) Even Wikipedia knows 43 distributions, much more can be found on

some of them are still Debian based (but migrate to Devuan).
2) Please provide proofs for relationship between MikeeUSA and Devuan project.

1) Proofs please. DDG & Google find only your words.
2) https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850069
After this I have switched to Devuan.
