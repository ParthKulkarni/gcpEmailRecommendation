Maybe have a look at https://fai-project.org/FAIme which is an easy
way to start with FAI (Fully automatic Installation). FAI is much more
powerfull as the debian-installer and very flexible.
It also has a rescue mode, which includes much more tools for
recovering than d-i and it does not use the busybox tools but just
the normal versions of the commands.
