that's a feature.
Normally you don't want this and nobody can delete tags unintentionally
as there is normally no reason to change history on a public git tree.
The normal case is to create new tag with the according commit SHA
reference.
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_tags.html
You can modify the behavior for your git tree, but really be careful if
you remove this protection! As said, you really don't want to do this! :)
