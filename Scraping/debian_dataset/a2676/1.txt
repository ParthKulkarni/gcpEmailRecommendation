Dear all,
I can confirm that Peter's tip above does work. Disabling the "above 4GB" 
option in BIOS-> Advanced->PCI Settings solved this problem and I was able to 
install Debian Stretch.
In my case, I used a USB stick as install medium and a USB-to-RJ45 converter 
for network installation (since the integrated network card is unsupported in 
kernel 4.9). Once finished, I installed the backport kernel (4.18 at this 
moment) and removed the USB-to-RJ45 converter. The computer is working 
perfectly.
Thanks!
Josep Guerrero
