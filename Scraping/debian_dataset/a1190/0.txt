I don't see how that follows.  We still have a standard that we're trying
to maintain for packages in the archive, and the fact that maintainers of
one package have not had a chance to review the package against that
standard for the more fiddly and less important bits doesn't change what
the standard is.
I think of the Standards-Version header in a package is a bookmark: this
is where I last left off in updating the packaging.  It doesn't change the
standard by which the package should be judged.
