Speaking as a Debian user who frequently has to apply local patches or
produce local versions of Debian packages for my job (usually weird
backports or bizarre local requirements), I cannot express to you how much
I prefer a Debian source package with patches in debian/patches over a Git
repository with patches as commits.
It is not even remotely close.  The externalized patches are an order of
magnitude easier for me to work with.
I have worked with both in the past, and when I got the standard Git
repository with patches as commits, it *always* became a maintenance
nightmare when the Debian package updated.  My local changes then became a
blizzard of merge conflicts and life was horrible.
I wouldn't say that it is *easy* to update a package with separate patches
to a new Debian package release, but it's certainly way *easier*.
