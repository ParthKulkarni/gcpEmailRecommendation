OK. I've considered switching a couple of times since 2012, but I've
been hitting various issues. But now that we have (almost, see below)
all components in place for gtk3 (including at-spi* and friends), and
now that old libraries are to be gotten rid of, I guess it's reasonable
for us to finally bite the bullet.

A few things need to happen, besides porting cdebconf to gtk3 (there
have been preliminary patches for many years already):
 - vte2.91 needs to build an installable udeb; I think I've reported a
   few issues already, but I don't tend to do so in a timely fashion
   since it's not used yet. Right now, libpcre2-8-0 is the issue.
 - theme support needs to be ported to gtk3.
Cheers,
