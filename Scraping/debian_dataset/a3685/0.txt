  Description     : simple password manager
spm is a single fully POSIX shell compliant script utilizing gpg2 combination
with basic tools such as find(1) and tree(1). Passwords are stored as GPG
encrypted files with directories funtioning as (sub)groups. spm reads/writes
passwords via standard input/output allowing you to build flexible and powerful
management tools.
spm was initially inspired by pass(1). The two are still similar, but they
should not be considered compatible.
In Debian the script will be installed as 'spm.sh' to avoid a name clash
(salt-common installs /usr/bin/spm). The manpage will be patched accordingly.
This package is for people looking for a pass(1)-like tool, but who prefer a
simpler tool (spm is less than 100 SLOC) and are not interested in the extra
functionality given by the integration of pass and git. I personally use both.
The upstream author supports this packaging effort and agrees with the
spm->spm.sh rename.
