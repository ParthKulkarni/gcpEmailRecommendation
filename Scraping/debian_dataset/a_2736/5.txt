Q: So must all Debian derivatives patch NTP and re-compileÂ¹ it as
Debians pool is hard-coded:

or only the commercial derivatives?

First of all: We don't what to cheat them or Debian, but the question is
interesting enough as it can have legal questions for all derivatives.

The question remains, if "Debian" can be our supplier and allow us (and
any other derivatives) to use their pool?

Any sane setup needs at least 4 servers. That is why there is that pool
project so not everyone has to run their own farm of NTP servers around
the world themselves.

Normally I tell our customers to ask their Internet providers for their
preferred NTP servers, as they usually run their own farm, which are
then close to their customers (network wise). Many routers have a
built-in NTP server anyway. This normally improves the accuracy and
reduces network traffic as with the pool you can get servers from the
other end of the world. Lucky you if you get that information from your
provider via DHCP (option nntp-server).
Even if your provider does not run its own farm, you can still
re-configure your servers to use at least the pool for your continent or
country, which hopefully are closer by network vise, too.
As an end-user you are not bound by that pool.ntp.org rule and can
configure whatever server you like.
But not as a software or Operating System vendors: I MUST NOT use
'pool.ntp.org'.
So my question is more like "is it okay to not change Debians default
NTP server selection", so the initial setup and those lazy enough to not
change the default get a sane time?
