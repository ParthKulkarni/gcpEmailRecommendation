Both. We considered freetype-config a deprecated legacy interface back in 2011 [1].
Upstream also recommend using pkg-config over freetype-config in freetype-config(1).
In fact, freetype-config has used pkg-config as a wrapper since February 2017 [2].

codesearch.debian.net shows 26 packages referencing AC_CHECK_FT2.

Not as far as I can tell. That said, I'm not against patching the m4 macro to
use PKG_CHECK_MODULES if you believe it will be useful.

Good point. I'll file a bug upstream to ask them to drop freetype-config.
In the meantime, I'll do the mass bug filing for Debian.
