Since Freetype upstream has not formally deprecated AC_CHECK_FT2, it's a
hard sell to make a number of Debian packages instantly RC-buggy by making a
Debian-specific change to drop this interface.
I believe that making AC_CHECK_FT2 a wrapper around PKG_CHECK_MODULES is the
prudent path forward, which should also be upstreamable to Freetype (since,
as you say, the macro currently wraps a command that they consider
deprecated).
