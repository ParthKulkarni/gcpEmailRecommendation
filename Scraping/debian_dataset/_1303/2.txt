This is not generally the case for distros other than Debian, so is
worth being aware of for Python. I don't know what the rationale is for
byte-compiling in maintainer scripts rather than during dpkg-buildpackage
- perhaps it's because we want to support many Python versions in parallel
and we can't do Arch:all binNMUs yet?
libostree normalizes timestamps to (time_t) 0 to maximize identical file
reuse between OS snapshots and avoid timestamp skew, and Flatpak apps
and runtimes generally include (only one Python version and) pre-compiled
.pyc files, resulting in either libostree or Flatpak (I forget which one)
needing a special-case hack for .pyc files which sets them to
(time_t) 1 instead.
