It strikes me as wrong to be introducing a new alias for this purpose.
The problem you want fixed is that the magic expansion is defaulting to
a protocol of http rather than https, so it seems to me that we need a
way of making it use https instead, rather than setting up a parallel
url thing that only deals with https.
I think that we should make sure that we can at some point change the
default protocol to be https, and still have a sensible result.
The two approaches that occur to me is to have some sort of flags
variable (debian-installer/flags) with an alias of flags, flg, or just f
if you're desperate to be brief.  Then a flag of 's' could make d-i
prefer secure options where available.  That way you'd just specify:
  f=s url=example.org
Alternatively, we could allow the protocol to be specified, but leave
the magic expansion in place if the : is not followed by a /, so that in
that case you'd specify:
  url=https:example.org
(I've not yet convinced myself that there are no problems with that idea
though)
That way we can decide to switch to defaulting to https for some future
release, and then tell people to either do f=i (for insecure), or
url=http:... to keep the old behaviour.
Cheers, Phil.
