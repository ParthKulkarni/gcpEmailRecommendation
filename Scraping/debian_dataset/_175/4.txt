Hi,
today I realised the lintian warning:
W: libbpp-core source: vcs-deprecated-in-debian-infrastructure vcs-git https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debian-med/libbpp-core.git
N: 
N:    The specified Vcs-* field points to an area within the *.debian.org
N:    infrastructure but refers to a version control system that has been
N:    deprecated.
N:    
N:    After 1st May 2018, Debian will not offer hosting for any version
N:    control system other than Git and the Alioth service will become
N:    read-only in May 2018. Packages should migrate to Git hosting on
N:    
N:    For further information about salsa.debian.org, including how to add
N:    HTTP redirects from alioth, please consult the Debian Wiki.
N:    
N:    Refer to
N:    https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/08/msg00008.html and
N:    https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa for details.
N:    
N:    Severity: normal, Certainty: certain
N:    
N:    Check: fields, Type: binary, udeb, source
N: 
I admit I do not agree with this and it was discussed here before.  Can
we please agree that anonscm.debian.org remains a valid URL and stop
starting another round of package uploads for the sake of changing Vcs
fields.
I could live with severity of "pedantic" for the lintian issue, thought.
However, I have not seen any argument why anonscm.d.o can not survive
the shutdown of Alioth and remain what it was when it was invented: A
generic Vcs URL for Debian packages no matter on what hostname the
packages really reside.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
