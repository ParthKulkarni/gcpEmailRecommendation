Maybe the proposal needs to be clarified, but my understanding was that
some companies are willing to fund a longer LTS for a restricted set of
packages and architecturesÂ¹, but that the product of that would continue
to be available for anyone.
I assume that Raphael knows that it wouldn't even make sense to ask if
that could be done in Debian infrastructure if it wasn't available to
all users.
Â¹ LTS is _already_ for a restricted set of packages and architectures,
  so this is just extra constraining to allow for longer support
