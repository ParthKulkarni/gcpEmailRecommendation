Sorry, but that's just not the case. Honestly, I tried, may others have
too, it's just not going to happen - either Debian provides it, or
they'll go somewhere else (or ask for the services to be based on a
different distro and so on).

Well for small systems for starters - most tools provided by busybox
are "just a few kb in size", but we still use it.
More importantly in my case, busybox telnetd is really standalone and
can do inetd work by itself, which is not the case for the standard
telnetd. So it's not just a matter of footprint, but lack of feature
too.

Even if you install it, it won't do anything unless you enable it via
an init script or by starting it manually. So there's no chance of
using it by mistake.
