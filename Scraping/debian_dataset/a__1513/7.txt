I should clarify a bit: we can't look at PROTOCOL at this point, since a
netinst with mirror/protocol=https is going to use local files on the
cdrom; if it was using https, debootstrap would do the job already
(except it would fail to load both packages right now since Steve only
added them to the images a few hours ago).
So I'm adding a mirror/protocol check instead, and I have to adjust
include/exclude handling accordingly.
