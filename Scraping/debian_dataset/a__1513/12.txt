Thanks Hilko.

Nothing interesting there, same locally with my own tests with your boot
parameters. I guess it wouldn't hurt if we had more details in syslog
from bootstrap-baseâ€¦
Anyway, adding a few debug bits, I can reproduce your issue and I think
it's quite clear: we run debootstrap from bootstrap-base using
file:///cdrom so we're not hitting the https code path. Cc-ing Philipp
and Marga who worked on adding https support since they might have ideas
on how to fix this.
