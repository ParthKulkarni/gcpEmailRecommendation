Nothing interesting there, same locally with my own tests with your

ideas
Given that Steve added it to the CD's force list, what about adding the 
two packages to $include in the https check that already exists in 
bootstrap-base.postinst (to set the proxy correctly)? I don't see a good 
way of adding the two packages after debootstrap ran but telling 
debootstrap to pull them in upon initial installation, assuming the 
media has it, seems feasible to me.
Kind regards
