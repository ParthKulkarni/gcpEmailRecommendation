Whilst that might be true, I don't think it's actually worth discussing,
we can get along pretty fine anyway :)
But let me answer some of your points.

This happened:
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/lintian/lintian.git/commit/?id=97912d84cf49d35188ac91ed3a50357095400386
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/lintian/lintian.git/commit/?id=098ceec8af75aae4d228c634fc1b19224b0e9273
It will be in the next Lintian release.
So please let's not lose our heads in discussing this to death.

It should read "it doesn't mean that I shouldn't make an effort".

Yes.

That would be nice, but I'm don't have a strong opinion on it.

I agree with all of this.  I say that a maintainer *should* do that
work.  If he doesn't because he believe his other changes are more
important and he wants to upload nonetheless, by all means, please do!
But then, be prepared for people and tools who look at your package to
notice that nobody checked whether it complies with the latest Policy.
That's all about it.  You haven't done something that you should do,
that's reflected.
For example, I often deferred bumping std-ver on packages which lagged a
lot behind and it would have take me too much time to through several
screenful of upgrading checklist, because I believed delivering other
fixes were more important at that time.
I personally am not too attached to lintian severities.  I keep all
pedantic and wishlist tags on, and always go through all of them
whenever I upload anything.

Sure.

Agree, we should not require it.  But I believe we should definitely
(more or less strongly) recommend it.
