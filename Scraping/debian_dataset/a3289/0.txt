Hello all,
My role in Debian recently changed from Debian Maintainer to Debian Developer. 
However, my DM permission record [1] in
https://ftp-master.debian.org/dm.txt are still left untouched. When I try to 
remove them, I would receive errors:
> Action: dm
> Fingerprint: 7E7729476D87D6F11D91ACCBC293E7B461825ACE
> Deny: iptux
>
There was an error processing this section. No changes were committed.
Details:
Key 7E7729476D87D6F11D91ACCBC293E7B461825ACE is not in DM keyring.
Is there any way to get rid of those records?
