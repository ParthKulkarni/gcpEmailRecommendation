Hello release team,
since 232-19, a couple of fixes accumulated which we'd like to see enter
testing/stretch
As this potentially affects the installer, I've CC debian-boot aka KiBi.
A complete debdiff is attached.
The changelog + annotations follows. Sorry if it's a bit verbose.

According to Martin, the DNSSEC in resolved still triggers too many
issues so it's not safe to enable by default.
Do note, that resolved in Debian is not enabled by default though. So
it's a low risk change which errs on the side of being conservative.

This is a potentially odd one. hal has been removed in jessie, but
apparently some users still have it installed after upgrading from
previous releases. This now leads to massive amounts of error messages
in the journal (basically on every uevent). So forcing the removal of
hal seems justified.
There is a slight catch: the Conflicts could potentially lead to udev
not being upgraded or udev removed in favour of keeping hal.
But: since no other package depends on hal anymore and lots of packages
depend on udev this scenario is rather unlikely. I did several upgrade
tests and was not able to trigger such a condition. In all cases, hal
was removed as intended.

A rather obvious 3 line fix

(not relevant for the installer)
While resolved is not enabled by default in Debian, if you do it
manually, it was spamming the journal. It's a low risk one-line change.

(not relevant for the installer)
Lot's of users where confused by error messages in the journal, if
plymouth is not installed (which is the default in Debian).
While the error message is harmless, it's better to simply avoid it
altogether.

(might be relevant for the installer)
Requested by a porter, didn't see a good reason not to include it.
Low-risk change.

Quoting Martin: "this is reasonably straightforward and also important to
get fixed in Stretch"

(might be relevant for the installer)
This only affects s390x, so regression potential is low and it's
important to get into stretch, otherwise we'd have migration issues in
buster (as names would change, which would be ugly)

Low risk change.

(not relevant for the installer)
This affects mostly users running a custom or older kernels.
The changelog should be self-explanatory. The last bump of the DM
interface version was in 4.8 and we don't want to to enforce that
as minimal kernel version.

straightforward fix which was requested by a user. Didn't see a good
reason not to cherry-pick this patch.

Thanks for reading/listening. Keep up the stellar work.
