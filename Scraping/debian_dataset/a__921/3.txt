FWIW: I'm very happy with the amount of details, many thanks!

Oh, wow, hal is still alive on some systems?! Crazy. :-)

I think that's fine, yeah. From a quick look, a few places might need an
update in d-i components (since we've got some hardcoded lists of
patterns at the moment…), but I suppose having the udev change is a
prerequisite anyway.

I'm not seeing anything directly using those in d-i components.

Adding debian-s390@lists.debian.org to the loop to make sure they're
aware of this. Can't really judge whether this could be annoying in d-i,
it seems to me that's just fixing a move which hadn't happened with the
net.ifnames transition, for specific hardware?

Again, many thanks for the details, that's really appreciated.
→ ACK for the whole lot.
