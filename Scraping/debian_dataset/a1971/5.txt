Hi,
While preparing some slides for my “News from the Debian Installer” talk
at DebConf17, it occured to me that we might want to reconsider the
default here:
    Guided - use a whole disk
    Guided - use a whole disk with LVM
    Guided - use a whole disk with encrypted LVM
    Manual
Current default is the first entry, and I think we should switch to
second one, with LVM.
If the user doesn't need to touch anything, that doesn't change much; if
the user wants to change partitioning afterwards, LVM's flexibility is
available.
Is anyone aware of any drawbacks of switching to LVM by default?
KiBi.
