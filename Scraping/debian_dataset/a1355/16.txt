There were 11 mails in the thread I linked as [1] in my initial mail.
None were really negative, just one person wondering if this means /
and /usr on separate filesystems is no longer supported (even though I
explicitly said it is in my initial mail).
Also, switching to merged-/usr, but still supporting non-merged-/usr
beyond a transition period means one uses one of the benefits for
maintainers no longer having to care where to install libraries or
programs (or worse: having to move them between / and /usr because
someone would like to use some additional program in early boot or a new
upstream release has support for some new feature requiring a library in
/usr).
I assume the less temperate responses are ones as [no argument]?  I
don't believe that one shouldn't base any decisions on less temperate
responses someone makes on the internet.  That way no change ever could
be implemented.  (What happens when I write less temperate responses to
the less temperate responses calling a proposal shit without any
argument?  Do I invalidate their less temperate response too or is that
reserved to the initial less temperate response?)
I strongly prefer technical reasons instead, such as the issue with
`dpkg -S` that was mentioned by Guillem.

No, that's a link to a message by me.

That is also what the linked mail is about.

Why not?  None of the 11 mails was really negative.
