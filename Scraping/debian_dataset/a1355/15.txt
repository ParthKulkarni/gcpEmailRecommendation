Hi Ian,
You're not citing any concrete examples of things that will supposedly
break.
AFAICS the closest you got was:

Which might be a fair point, except that late mounting of /usr became
explicitly unsupported with the release of Stretch:
  https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/armel/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#late-mounting-usr
The adoption of usrmerge was blocked before on the basis that it was too
late in the release cycle.  We are now fairly early in the release cycle.
That being the case, I think we should let the people volunteering to do
the work to get on with it without delay. That way there will be plenty
of time to address any real downsides that might be revealed.
Cheers, Phil.
P.S. I've not even installed usrmerge on any systems as yet, so please
don't assume that I'm a rabid supporter of this effort -- it just seems
entirely sane to me, whereas the pushback you pointed at ... not so much.
