AFAICT this program is not packaged for Debian.
I would like the actually-running source code for this too to be
distributed by manpages.debian.org.  Would you accept a patch to do

(Are you using a version of mdocml running out of a git tree, or
what?  Are there other unpackaged dependencies?)
Thanks,
Ian.
