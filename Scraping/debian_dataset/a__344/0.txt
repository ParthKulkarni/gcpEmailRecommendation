I'm not sure I'll be able to run tests (with a hacked archive due to the
udebs being in s-p-u) before late evenings of Tuesday or Wednesday.
Should I upload right away, so that we can build d-i and d-i-n-i first,
and eventually not include them for the point release if subsequent
tests show regressions?
That would get builds out of your way, while leaving us an opportunity
to abort their inclusion if regressions are detected?
Cheers,
