After discussions on IRC, it appears unlikely that the currently WIP 
kernel update will be ready in sufficient time to be happy with it on 
all architectures.
- go ahead with freezing 9.5 this weekend, and hope the kernel's ready 
in time
- go ahead with freezing 9.5 this weekend, and update the kernel via 
stable-updates later
- just do 8.11 this weekend, accept the version skew and get 9.5 
released as soon as we can
To be entirely honest, I'm not that comfortable with announcing a freeze 
this close to the actual date. In terms of packages with version skew, 
we have:
- packages from the security archive, where users upgrading should 
already have the jessie-security package installed in any case
- intel-microcode, src:patch and clamav, where it looks like the jessie 
package should work on stretch without issues
Given all of the above, I think the sanest option is to concentrate on 
getting 8.11 done and jessie off our radar and then get 9.5 sorted.
For suggested dates for 9.5, we know that June 30th is a no-go, Debcamp 
starts on July 21st and then Debconf on the 28th. So that leaves us 
with:
- July 7th
- July 14th
Are people available for either or both of those dates?
Regards,
Adam
