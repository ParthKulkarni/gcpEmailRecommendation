Adding Kernel team list explicitly to the loop only for this later
part, dropping other recipients which might not be interested for this
reply specifically.
Currently we are cherry-picking secrutiy fixes in our
stretch-security branch. In parallel there is work on the stretch
branch to update to a newer 4.9.x stable release and to have it
included in the next point release. Now if the later turns out to be
the case earlier than any DSA, then there will actually likely be a
ABI bump for the kernel (the update will be at least up to 4.9.102 and
there are too many ABI changes as they would be possible to avoid).
