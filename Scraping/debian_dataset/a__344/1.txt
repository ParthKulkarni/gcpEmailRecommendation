This is now up to 4.9.106 and there will definitely be an ABI break. I missed
the thread start (I'm not subscribed to -release anymore), but in the quoted
text I can see there were three proposed dates for the 9.5 point release. May
26th and June 2nd are out of the equation now but is June 9th already
targeted?
If so, we really need to move forward on this (and it might be a bit late
already) if we want to make sure it builds everywhere.
