We're past any of the above by now, and while looking through the to-do 
list for the final jessie point release, I noticed that we currently
have some packages in opu with versions higher than stable.
We can either accept the packages and put up with the situation for a
short while, or do 9.5 before 8.11. In practical terms, that would
likely mean both 9.5 and 8.11 on June 23rd, freezing both next weekend.
How do people feel about that?
Cheers,
Adam
