Hmmm? The plan is to support building dini from spu if d-i is (still)
there (during point release preparation) as customary, along with
allowing a fall back to fetching d-i from the stable suite if the
initial download from s-p-u fails (which happens once the point release
has finished).
IOW: Supporting rebuilding dini from stable after a point release in
addition to (and not instead of) building it from s-p-u only.
Hopefully clearer than my initial mail, but please yell if it isn't.
Cheers,
