I have just finished a test build with the aforementioned changes
and it successfully initializes the USB host controllers on
a system with an AXP20x.
A patch against the kernel package is attached.  After that
change is applied to the kernel package, we would then need to
add the i2c-modules udeb to the installer builds for armhf.
