Package: debian-installer
Version: 20170525
SD-card image from https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/armhf/daily/netboot/SD-card-images/, doesn't have a kernel module, so mmc and network does'nt work.
There was also a thread in debian-arm mailing list about this issue:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2017/01/msg00000.html
The missing module is i2c_rk3x. Could you add to the image? 
Thanks in advance.
