This has been done now, with the result of 172 open bugs about transitional
packages which exists since at least jessie, sometimes wheezy. (Didnt check
squeezeâ€¦) - plus an additional of 34 of those bugs which have been fixed since
the stretch release.
IOW: hopefully buster will get rid of 200 useless packages eventually.

Next will be running this script on jenkins (then slightly changed), to point
out packages in buster (which are not fixed in sid) with reverse dependencies
to packages which are transitional packages since stretch. And then I might 
file some (normal) bugs then too, but I guess this will be in some time onlyâ€¦
Plus, *once we've released buster* I plan to again file bugs, that time against
transitional packages which have been traditional since stretch (and are still
transitional in buster and sid).
