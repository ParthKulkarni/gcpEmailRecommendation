Hi,
My two pence worth...
In my honest opinion, rating certain content types within a package should be
done along the lines of PEGI[1]. A self regulatory rating done as part of a
social policy and administered by the particular packages maintainer. All
subsequent questioning of rating would be done via bug reports against the
particular package.
Not an exhaustive list...
* Rating set within debian folder - maybe rating file.
* Seen on packages.d.o, PTS and query by apt etc. for package.
* Should not be auto installed as a recommends etc.
