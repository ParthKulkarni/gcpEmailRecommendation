Policy in this case would document the convention of using -offensive for
packages that are split along those lines *by the maintainer*.  I agree
that we certainly shouldn't attempt to define what is and isn't offensive
in Policy and leave that up to the maintainer.  But it sounds like we have
a package naming convention for this specific type of package split, and
the standardization of the naming convention (-offensive instead of -off
or -dirty or -nsfw or whatever other thing someone might come up with) is
within the traditional grounds of Policy.
