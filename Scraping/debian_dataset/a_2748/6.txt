Two thoughts: first, give it another try. I was able to refresh my
keyring using the debian keyserver a few seconds ago:
$ gpg  --refresh-keys --keyserver keyring.debian.org
gpg: refreshing 229 keys from hkp://keyring.debian.org
...
gpg:         new signatures: 160
...
Second, the keyservers all communicate with each other. If one is down,
aim for another. e.g. keyserver.ubuntu.com or other choices from
https://sks-keyservers.net/status/
Eventually your key will make it everywhere.
Thanks
