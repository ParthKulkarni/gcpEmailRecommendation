Interestingly, I rarely needed to have that knowledge, and when I did,
I always went from the actual values of this field to something like
what Lumin proposed, thought a bit, and then produced the result in my
head. When you know how the package can be installed, answers to other
questions appear semi-automatically in your head, but itâ€™s not always
easy, in my opinion, to do this deduction in the opposite direction.
I do agree with Lumin the current set of values is not suitable to be
processed by average human beings :)
