Yes, and I didn't read anything about that in the several packaging/uploading
docu.
So that's mostly best practice, but no strict packaging rule or the like?
Also, I don't know anything about tagging.
So, I need to know something more about this tagging:
When do we use it?
Just for every new uploaded version, as it seems...
More circumstances, where to set tags?
Which tags do we use? The lightweighted or the annotated ones?
Looking at the existing tags, it seems that's annotated ones, but without
GPG signatur. Right?
Holger
