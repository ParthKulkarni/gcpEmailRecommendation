well, yes and no. By design GPLv3 is incompatible with GPLv2-only,
so this is "right" in the sense that it works as intended. It's also a
major fuckup for some GPLv2-only users (as you just described), which
as a result made *me* like+trust the FSF and the GPL less.
(And which then also resulted in me choosing GPLv2-only over GPLv2 or GPLv3
more often.)
By now I also think these "or any future version" clauses areâ€¦ brave.
