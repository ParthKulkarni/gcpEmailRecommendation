The group is now on salsa at:
    https://salsa.debian.org/xml-sgml-team
and not all packages are abandoned, thought several are.

You think wrong, as that mail address has been migrated on the temporary
server on alioth-lists.debian.net, together with all the others
(although I believe most of them should have been archived away, and
move to use a team+foo@tracker.d.o address).

If you checked DDPO as you said, and noticed that *some* are on alioth,
you must also have noticed that the others are already on salsaâ€¦
    https://salsa.debian.org/groups/xml-sgml-team/-/group_members
I added you to the team now.

I'd consider asking the salsa admin to move it under the team namespace,
unless you think it would be best under /debian/, of course.
