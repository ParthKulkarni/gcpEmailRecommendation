Subject : SALSA migration of XML/SGML packages (sgml-data for me)

Hi,
I am wondering what is happening with XML/SGML packages.
I am doing SALSA migration and I realized I need to RFA or Orphan some
of my packages.  Specifically:
 sgml-data
 debiandoc-sgml
 debiandoc-sgml-doc
 debiandoc-sgml-pt-br
All debiandoc-sgml* packages can be almost safely set to Orphan path.
(Maybe not for buster but after buster. Debian Policy doesn't use this
any more.  I will take care them if needed.)
But sgml-data has too many packages depending on it and it is best to
hand this package to a right person.
This sgml-data is SGML package so it is most appropriate to be taken
care by people who were on Debian XML/SGML Group
<debian-xml-sgml-pkgs@lists.alioth.debian.org>.  I think this is
unreachable email address by now.  Listing this as maintainer address
may be RC bug.  That is why I am writing to
debian-devel@lists.debian.org while CCing recent uploaders of these
packages to be sure.  Many important packages list this email address.
https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=debian-xml-sgml-pkgs%40lists.alioth.debian.org
 libxml2
 libxslt
 docbook-utils
 ...
Some of them still list old alioth VCS URL.
Does anyone working on moving these repo to SALSA and uploading properly
updated packages with reachable group address?
FYI: I created SALSA repo for sgml-data
