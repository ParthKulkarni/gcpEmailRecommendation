The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the fifth release
candidate of the installer for Debian 9 "Stretch".
This will be the last release candidate, and the next upload of the
debian-installer package will be used for the final Debian 9.0 build,
without a separate announcement for the installer.
Improvements in this release
============================
 * base-installer:
    - Only enable a resume option if a suitable device exists
      (#860403).
 * debian-cd:
    - Since the firefox browser no longer fitted on the Xfce CD, the
      installation guide was removed from those images to free up some
      space, so that firefox fits again.
 * debian-installer:
    - Make sure gen-hd-image exits as soon as an error is triggered
      (See: #864260).
 * debian-archive-keyring-udeb:
    - Add support for Stretch keys (#860830, #860831), and remove
      support for Squeeze ones (#863303).
 * espeak-ng:
    - Adjust buffer size again, to avoid overlapping.
 * netcfg:
    - The rdnssd package is no longer installed automatically for IPv6
      setups. Depending on package installation choices, it could
      prevent network-manager from being installed (#854801).
Hardware support changes
========================
 * debian-installer:
    - Bump partition size for armhf SD card images from 40MB to 100MB
      (for both hd-media and netboot), since it became too small for
      some setups. This fixes missing files for the A10-OLinuXino-Lime
      platform, and allows developers for easier debugging (#864260).
 * grub-installer:
    - Add support for systems with a large number of disks (>= 27),
      which can happen in some JBOD setups (#839894).
 * linux:
    - udeb: Add efivarfs to efi-modules, which can be needed to
      retrieve firmware or configuration bits from the Debian
      Installer (#862555).
Localization status
===================
 * 75 languages are supported in this release.
 * Full translation for 21 of them.
Known bugs in this release
==========================
 * An extraneous open-iscsi step is performed right before the end of
   each installation, even if there are no iSCSI devices (#863435).
 * The lack of an i2c-modules package on armhf was only determined
   lately to be the reason for several issues on this platform. It is
   expected to merge a new version of the linux package for the final
   release (#864536, #864457, #856111).
See the errata[2] for details and a full list of known issues.

so please try it. Installer CDs, other media and everything else you
