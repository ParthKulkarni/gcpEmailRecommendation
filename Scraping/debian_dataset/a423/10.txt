https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/debian-installer-netboot-images hasn't seen an
update in a while (and thus is unusuable due to kernel version skew), is it
on your collective radar to update the package til Saturday?
(Debian Edu uses that packages to support installation via PXE out of the box.)
Shall I file an RC bug to make the problem more visible and known?
