Seeing the post on PXE for UEFI on planet.debian.org and noting that
you're planning another d-i release.
Is there any chance of putting in the symlink in d-i that will link 
bootnetx64.efi in the same way as pxelinux as below
Also in netboot.tar.gz similarly
bootnetx64.efi -> debian-installer/amd64/bootnetx64.efi
This is exactly the way that pexlinux.0 and pxelinux.cfg are already
linked and would be a trivial change that would allow UEFI booting
more readily.
Thank you for your consideration
