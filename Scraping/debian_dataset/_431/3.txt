According to https://midnight-commander.org/ the current broken version is 
4.8.18, same as the app reports in its help screen. Filing a report from a 
different machine there's no good way to know whatever additions the package 
management system may have tacked on, or is there?
If you mean by "default configuration" a new installation and no previously 
saved settings rather than an upgrade, the bug is not apparent. However, after 
update from <4.8.18 to 4.8.18, the "default configuration" is to use the saved 
settings, which is why this bug manifests. The valid saved setting is improperly 
applied *every* time mc is started, not just on a first use.
the maintainer and/or the release managers to make.--
