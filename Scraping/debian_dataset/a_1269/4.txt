Aeh, what?
If you make changes to debian/, you need only 'git commit'.
If you change something in the upstream source (aka, add a new patch),
the "dance" is:
$ gbp pq import
$ # make changes
$ git commit; gbp pq export
And similarly for git-dpm. Surely typing these two extra commands is not
"a lot more work", is it? Note that they will succeed without
interaction.
If you want to edit an existing patch, you need to add one "git rebase
-i" command. I would maybe count that as "more work", but certainly not
as "a lot more".
Best,
