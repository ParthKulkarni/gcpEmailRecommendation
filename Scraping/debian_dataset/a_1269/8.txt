But, as far as I can tell, doing this work up-front is much easier:
When using git-dpm or gbp-pq, the tool will present you with the
conflicts separately for each Debian-modification that is being
rebased. Resolving the conflicts is the only work you have to do.
If you do the work later, then you start with a bunch of commits, any of
which potentially contains parts of multiple Debian modifications. It is
not clear how me how you would go about untangling them in a systematic
way.
Best,
