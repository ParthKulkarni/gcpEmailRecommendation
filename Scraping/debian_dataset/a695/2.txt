Hmm, I it found documented, that there *is* a limit of 255 characters for the
*kernel*, but the bootloader *may* allow to exceed this.
As that means, it depends on which bootloader is used, if the limit is at
255 or more, I think it is best to mention this limit of 255 chars, but
I will relativise it a bit:
<quote>
Also there is a limit of 255 characters for the whole kernel command line,
everything above this limit may be silently truncated.

(note the "may" :-) )
