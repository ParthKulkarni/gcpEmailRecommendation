Hi Holger,
Thanks for picking up this long-stale bug :)
It looks like sometime in the intervening 10 years this restriction has
been fixed, or perhaps just lengthened, but I just booted a live CD with
GRUB and a 260 character kernel command line and it was *not* truncated.
Rather than quoting a specific 255-character limit, perhaps just mention
that particularly long kernel command lines may be silently truncated?
cheers
Russell
