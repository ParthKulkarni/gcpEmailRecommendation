I am writing software which should call a program in specific
version range
(or fail to call it if the program in this version range is not
installed).
Please elaborate the problem you want to solve.
I am writing software for transforming between XML namespaces.
The transforming is done by "scripts" (Python scripts, XSLT scripts,
Ruby scripts, Bash scripts, etc.)
For each conversion I specify several alternative scripts.
A script may be specified by a user of my software by the URL of the
script and name and version range of the interpreter (simplified
explanation).
For example, in input of my software there may be the following
alternative converters:
Python 2.7.1 - 2.7.14 http://example.org/script.py
XSLT 1.0 - 1.1 http://example.org/script.xslt
To choose an installed interpreter, then my program should check if
"python2.7" is installed, if its version is in 2.7.1 - 2.7.14 range. It
also to check if "xsltproc" is installed and its version.
For this I need the upstream versions of "python2.7" and "xsltproc".
