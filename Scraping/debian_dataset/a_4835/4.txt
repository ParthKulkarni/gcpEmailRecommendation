Subject: developers-reference: Announcement for adding "Package Salvaging" process to dev-ref
Source: developers-reference
Severity: normal
Dear dev-ref maintainers,
as you've probably saw on -dev, I'm currently working to implement the
Package Salvaging process. The discussion is still ongoing but planed to
be closed on Saturday, September 1st. You can find the discussion here:
The thread starts at:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/07/msg00453.html,
You can find the proposal and call for discussion here:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/08/msg00277.html
I'm filing this bug report to make you aware of it, along with the
announcement that I will start finalizing the text on the weekend to be
able to provide a merge request shortly afterwards. My original timeline
was proposed in this message [1] , but I might not need the "adaption
period", as the input received was only on typos and grammar, not asking
for changes with regards to the process, so atm I think I ll be able to
come up with the patch to final discussion on Sunday, if that does not
change. (so this would accelerate the timeline by one week)
