Could you elaborate on that?
The latest major issue I am aware of was about #727621 and the backport 
of the fix.[1] #727621 was not even a regression, this was new 
functionality accidentally not provided by gcc on armel.

Your theoretical discussion based on upstream definitions misses which 
architectures actually have a proven track record of frequent toolchain 
problems in recent years.
Any discussion about real problems has to include arm64 as a prime 
candidate for demotion - no matter the upstream definition.
We even had last-minute toolchain regressions like #863152, which means 
that we cannot rebuild some packages we ship for arm64 in stretch.
Such regressions are a problem both for security support and licence reasons.
The root problem for most actual breakages is that regresssions are 
usually not in boring stale old code nobody touches - regressions
tend to be in sexy new code that is under heavy development.
arm64 and mips64el are the most recent of the architectures in stretch.
There is a lot of upstream toolchain development happening for arm64.
These are the reasons why arm64 and mips64el have been a burden
in recent years.
And the next burden will be if riscv64 gets added in bullseye.
I do not have the impression that this burden is unmanageable, but if 
you disagree the actual discussion you have to start is about delaying
the inclusion of ports for new hardware in a Debian stable release.
