But only the stock kernel, which turns it non-free software.
There's no benefits for us, too -- a thief or attacker can boot/install
Windows, read any non-encrypted data, etc.  We're better off if we don't
support secureboot on such hardware.  Debian has enough use share to be
named when governments are concerned -- if we start providing "secure"boot
enabled kernels, it'd be an easy sell to lock down consumer machines to
disallow kernels not blessed by Microsoft's key.
