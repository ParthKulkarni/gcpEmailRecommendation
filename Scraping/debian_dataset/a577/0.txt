I'm running Debian armel on, I don't know, 1000 or 2000 devices.
(Not myself, customers of my company are.)
Raspberry Pi Zero is compatible only with Debian armel, too.
IMHO, it's not strange at all and totally current hardware.
So, from my side a big THANK YOU to Adrian!

Well, to me the main strength of Debian is, that it is the
"universal operating system". Means, we might not care about
0.1 % of strange use cases, but 1 % might still be relevant.
It it were not for such things as armel support, I get the
99 % much better covered by other distros, maybe.
If the 1 % and the 99 % are really not possible to match, we
have to go for the 99 %, of course.
But, please, Adrian, do not think, that actions by others are
directed against you or your work. We are all volunteers, giving
their best. In this specific case, a little bit more of
communication would have been better, but shit happens and your
aggressive tone doesn't help solving issues in a constructive
manner.
