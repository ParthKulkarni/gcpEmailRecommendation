Does that mean that we actually have to infer (check using grep?) if the
file is armored or not? I think `apt-key add' just dealt with whatever
it got and put the key into the keyring using gpg's --import function.
So it's a little unfortunate that we'd now need to know the format of
what we need to put into the fragment directory.
