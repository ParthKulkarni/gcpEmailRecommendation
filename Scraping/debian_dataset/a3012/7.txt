If you look at the table at [1] then you will see that there are exactly four
profile names that allow changes. The pkg.$source.$foo namespace where any kind
of change is allowed and the stage1, stage2 and nodoc profiles where changes
are limited to non-functional changes. The nodoc profile is interesting here
because when we talk about not making "functional" changes to packages, then
this is because we don't want to break assumptions made by other packages
depending on it. As by policy Â§12.3, removing (or changing) content from
/usr/share/doc should always be fine:
 | Packages must not require the existence of any files in /usr/share/doc/ in
 | order to function. [6] Any files that are used or read by programs but are
 | also useful as stand alone documentation should be installed elsewhere, such
 | as under /usr/share/package/, and then included via symbolic links in
 | /usr/share/doc/package.
So by that logic gtk-doc documentation should be put into /usr/share/package
because it is "read by programs" to rewrite cross-references from web links as
you say.
When we we added this exception to the nodoc profile, we thought that given
this policy paragraph, it logically followed that we could allow non-functional
changes here. This exception is indeed interesting and I guess it's debatable
whether generating "cross-references" counts as something a package needs "in
order to function" such that it falls under this "must" clause of Debian
policy.
But I'll leave figuring this out to somebody else. :)
Thanks!
