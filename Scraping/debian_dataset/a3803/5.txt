Please coordinate with debian-boot@ (bonus points: cc me) when changing
udebs; that includes introducing new udebs.

As mentioned on #debian-boot earlier, postinst, config, templates (and
their translation) are used with the eject-udeb package getting inserted
into main-menu, which is d-i's main program, driving debconf prompts.
So if you move the udeb around, please retain all relevant metadata
(including the XB-Installer-Menu-Item field, which tells d-i where to
insert this item into main-menu).
If you move stuff around, please make sure we update this file
accordingly, to track l10n status:
  svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk/packages/po/packages_list
