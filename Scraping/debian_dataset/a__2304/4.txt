Hi Ivo,

I had tried to reproduce setups from reporters to debug this further but
unfortunately I wasn't successfulâ€¦

It's nice to know which part(s) doesn't work, this is good news.

ACK, ignoring something we can't grub-mount looks like a better idea than
just waiting forever. We can still try and find a solution for those cases
later on, and think of backporting it once it's been tested for a while.

I think reverting to the previous breakage shouldn't happen at allâ€¦
