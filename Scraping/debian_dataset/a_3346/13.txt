There are far more annoying problems that are caused by, for example,
building in a really outdated chroot or a chroot for the wrong
distribution and so on.
(Also the test is wrong, /bin can be a symlink without the system
having merged-/usr when the local admin just moved some files around to
a more preferred location...)

usrmerge being installed doesn't tell you if a system has merged-/usr
or not.  Newly installed systems will have merged-/usr, but no usrmerge
(as debootstrap creates the symlinks), or usrmerge could be removed
after the system has been converted (I did that for my systems).
