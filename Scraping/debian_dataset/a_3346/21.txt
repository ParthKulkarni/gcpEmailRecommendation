Well, the buildd configuration change has been reverted. What worries me

As long as there is one Debian Developer (or any other person who has 
the right to upload binary packages) who has a merged /usr on his system 
used for building packages, there is a risk of reintroducing the bug 
through his package. Maybe we should somehow, in the short term, modify 
dpkg to add something like "Tainted-By: usr-merge" control field to all 
binary packages produced, if a package is built on a system with merged 
/usr (detected via /bin being a symlink). And a corresponding automatic 
check that would auto-reject binary packages with any Tainted-By control 
field from being uploaded to the Debian archive.
P.S. I am not even a Debian Maintainer, so all of the above may be 
rubbish. Would appreciate a reply that confirms or disproves that my 
thoughts make any sense.
