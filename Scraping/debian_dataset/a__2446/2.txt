Hi all,
is anyone still interested in the citadel packages? I stopped using them ages
ago and finally ran out of time maintaining them. If anyone has interest and is
willing to put a bit of time into them, be my guest. They are in a decent
shape, but a new upstream version needs to get uploaded. If not I'm going to
orphan them or even ask for their removal from the archive. 
Michael
