I absolutely agree.
The disruption from this kind of thing is minimal, and clearly IMO
outweighs the benfit.
Ultimately whether to allow this is a matter for the maintainer but I
think maintainers shoudl be encouraged to allow it - even, to
encourage it.
And there should be clear guidance for other DDs on when and how to
exercise this authority.  That should include the level of confidence
that a DD should have before making such a commit; whether there
should be a `mass commit' d-devel review process; and whether such
changes should be accompanied by a changelog entry.
