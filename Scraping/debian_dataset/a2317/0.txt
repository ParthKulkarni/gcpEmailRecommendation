Dear -devel,
as announced earlier, I have together with worked on the text for the
salvaging process. You can find the texts here: Titanpad [1] for dev-ref
and the accompanying Wikipage [2]. Credits to Pierre-Elliott BÃ©cue, as
he wrote the first draft and thereby helped me a lot.
For the timeline, as earlier communicated I think we should discuss this
until Sepember 1st and then I will start incooporating received intput
to have a final text available soon.
[1] https://pad.riseup.net/p/debian-salvaging-packages-keep
[2] https://wiki.debian.org/PackageSalvaging
For your convenience (and for easier replies) here is the full text
for bith parts (the dev-ref part and the wiki raw text).
(The dev-ref needs modification in 5.9.5, therefore this is provided as
a patch.)
Cheers,

<title>Package Salvaging</title>
<para>
Package salvaging is the process by which, one attempts to save a
package that, while not officially orphaned, appear poorly maintained or
completely unmaintained.  This is a weaker and faster procedure than
orphaning a package officially through powers of the MIA team.
Salvaging a package is not meant to replace MIA handling, and in
contrast to it, it does not comment about the overall activity of a
maintainer. Instead, it handles a package maintainership transition for
a single package only, leaving any other package or Debian membership or
upload rights (when applicable) untouched.  </para>
<para> Note that the process is only intended for actively taking over
maintainership. Do not do salvaging, when you do not intend to maintain
the package for a prolonged time. If you only want to fix certain
things, but not taking over the package, you must use the NMU process,
even if the package would be eligble for salvaing.  The NMU process is
explained in <xref linkend="nmu"/> </para>
<para> Another important thing to remember: It is not acceptable to
hijack others' packages.  If followed, this salvaging process will help
you to ensure that your endaveour is not a hijack, but a (legal)
salvaging procedure and you can counter any allegations of hijack with a
reference to this process.  This ensurance should especially help new
maintainers to Debian to have confidence taking over packages by
salvaging. </para>
<para> The process is split into two phases: In the first phase you
determine whether the package in question is
<emphasis>eligble</emphasis> for the salvaging process.  Only when the
eligbiliy has been determined, you can enter the second phase, the
<emphasis>actual</emphasis> package salvalging. </para>

<title>When a package is eligble for package salvaging</title>
<para>
A package becomes elible for salvaging when it has been neglected by the
current maintainer. To determine that a package has really been
negelected by the maintainer, the following coarse indicators might give
an idea what to look for: </para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem> <para>NMUs, especially if there have been more than one NMU
    in a row. </para></listitem>
  <listitem> <para>Bugs filed against the package do not have answers
    from the maintainer. </para></listitem>
  <listitem> <para>Upstream has released several versions, but despite
    a bug entry exists asking for it, it has not been packaged
    </para></listitem>
  <listitem> <para>There are QA issues with the package
  </para> </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
As said, the above list is only a very coarse. The wiki page <ulink
url="&wiki-salvaging-packages;">Salvaging Packages</ulink> expands on
eligbility criterias for package salvaging, you are recommended follow
them to determine eligbility.  Though you are allowed to deviate from
the guidlines on a case-by-case basis, but you will be required to
document the deviations and your reasoning when filing the intent to
salvage bug later.

  <emphasis>"Intend to Salvage"</emphasis>)>>.  You may also offer
  to only take co-maintenance of the package. When you file the bug, you

  Additionally, if the maintainer(s) seems to be generally inactive,
  please inform the MIA team by adding
  <literal>mia@qa.debian.org</literal> to <literal>X-Debbugs-CC</literal>)
  as well.  Beside the explicit expression of the intent to salvage,
  please also take the time to document your assessment of the eligbilty,

  make it more easy to assess the situation for others.

  In this step you need to wait if there are any objection to the

  The current maintainers may also agree to your intent to salvage by
  filing a (signed) public response to the the bug. They might offer you
  to become co-maintainer instead of the sole maintainer.  On team
  maintained packages, a member of the associated team can accept your
  salvaging proposal by sending out an signed agreement notice to the ITS
  bug, alternatively inviting you to become a new Co-Maintainer of the
  package. The team may require you to keep the package under the team's
  umbrella, but may ask or invite you to join the team. In any of these
  cases where you have gotten the OK to proceed, you can uploaded the new
  package immediately as the new (co-)maintainer(s), without the need to

'''WIP -- this process is still being made and not effective at the moment.'''
Package Salvaging is the process by which, one attempts to save a
package that, while not officially orphaned, appear poorly maintained
or completely unmaintained.  This is a weaker and faster procedure
than orphaning a package officially through powers of the MIA team.
Salvaging a package is not meant to replace MIA handling, and in
contrast to it, it does not comment about the overall activity of a
maintainer. Instead, it handles a package maintainership transition
for a single package only, leaving any other package or Debian
membership or upload rights (when applicable) untouched.
For the description of the package salvaging process, please see the
Developer's reference <add link when ready here>.
<<TableOfContents(2)>>
== Egilibilty criterias of a package ==
=== How to use the criterias ===
The following criteria can be used to determine whether a package is
eligible for salvaging or not. This criteria are conservative on
purpose, to enable especially new maintainers to assess the eligibility
without the need to fear for be called a hijacker later. More
experienced maintainers are allowed to deviate from them on a
case-by-case basis but must be prepared to defend their point of view
when challenged.
=== The (conservative) criterias ===
A package is eligible for salvaging if it is in clear need of some love
and care, i.e. there are ''open bugs'', ''missing upstream releases'',
or there is ''work needed'' from a ''quality-assurance perspective'';
<<BR>> '''AND''' there is the ''need to upload the package'' to deal
with these issues; <<BR>> '''AND''' at least ''one'' of these criteria
applies:
 * There is no visible activity regarding the package for '''six
 months''', '''OR'''
 * A previous NMU was not acknowledged, and a bug justifying another NMU
 is pending for '''one month''' <<footnote(A NMU is automatically
 ACKED if there is a subsequent upload of the maintainer including the
 content/fixes of the NMU.)>>, '''OR'''
 * The last upload was an NMU and there was no maintainer upload within
  '''one year''', '''OR'''
 * Bugs exist for more than one major missing upstream
 version<<footnote(Can also be one bug, constantly modified when new
 upstream versions became available)>> and the first bug is older than
 '''one year''', '''OR'''
 * The package blocks a sourceful transition for '''six months''' after
 a transition bug was filed against the package in question.
The Level of activity should be defined "in favor" of the maintainer if
in doubt. A maintainer may ask for help or welcome a NMU. This counts as
activity with respect to salvage criteria. If a package lacks uploads,
there is no visible bug triaging or no answers to bugs at all, and â€“ if
applicable â€“ the source package's VCS does not show commits, this is an
indication, that the package is not well maintained.
== FAQs ==
'''Q: Are team maintained packages also subject to salvaging?'''<<BR>>
A: Team-maintained packages are not really special in this aspect and
the process should be applicable for them too. Like any maintainer and
uploader on the package, members of the listed packaging team can also
actively veto or allow salvaging (but not against the expressed will of
the maintainer).
'''Q: The salvaging step says that I might be offered co-maintainership
instead, but this is not something I want to do. Or the maintainer asks
me to be maintainer instead of co-maintainer, but I do not want to do
this. Do I have to? Do I really have to join the team or offer the
salvager to join the team? ''' <<BR>>
A: Of course you are not obliged to do anything in Debian you do not
want to. On the other hand, you cannot salvage a package if the current
maintainer/uploaders/team disagrees with the conditions. On the other
hand, those offers provides beneficial opportunities to all parties, so
they should be at least considered.  Beside, I encourage you to discuss
that with the maintainers/teams to find mutually agreeable solutions.
'''Q: This new upstream versions... They are not suitable for Debian!
How to avoid that my package will be salvaged?'''<<BR>>
'''Q: I do not have time to fix that bug at the moment, but I will do so
before the freeze. How to avoid being salvaged?'''<<BR>>
A: Explain that in a response to the bug in question. That's activity
shown on the package and makes it ineligible for salvaging. (Though it
would be great if you could add some background information/explanations
as well.)
'''Q: There are many loopholes in the process, allowing a (mallice)
maintainer to game things!'''<<BR>>
A: The process foundation is on "honest" maintainers not wanting to harm
Debian on purpose. (for which we'd have other kind of processes).
