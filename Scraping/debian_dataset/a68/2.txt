This approach and patch looks good to me.  I'm OK with you committing
and uploading it, modulo the comments below.

I think this would be clearer reversed, i.e.:
  DEB_FRONTENDS=passthrough text newt
  UDEB_FRONTENDS=passthrough text newt
  ifeq ($(filter pkg.cdebconf.nogtk,$(DEB_BUILD_PROFILES)),)
      DEB_FRONTENDS+=gtk
      UDEB_FRONTENDS+=gtk
  endif

I think I may understand what this is doing now after some confusion,
but it's pretty opaque and definitely needs at least a comment.  I think
you're trying to keep the package contents identical regardless of build
profile, since the main build system won't handle it in this case due to
the change in *_FRONTENDS?
Thanks,
