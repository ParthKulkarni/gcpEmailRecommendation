If a user get to install his/her own plugins, they should go in the
user's home directory, e.g. /home/user/.config/scheduler/plugins/.
Non-root users should not generally be given write permission to
/usr/local, and definitely not to /usr/lib.
If the app takes care of installing the plugins on the user's behalf,
that is slightly different.  However, if the plugin can be selected by
the user from a non-trusted source, I would still go with the user's
directory.  Allowing a non-root user to put his own plugin where others
can execute it without being able (even required) to verify its
integrity is a huge security hole.
Ian's comments are good for admin-installed plugins that the users can
use.  In fact there is good precedent for an app checking
/usr/lib/pkg/... for plugins installed from Debian packages,
/usr/local/lib/pkg/... for plugins installed by the admin from
non-Debian locations, and then finally the user's .config/pkg/...
directory.
