My current plan is to provide the source package in the same
repository in which I will distribute the binary packages. I will also
add a link to a repository where I manage these changes. The Readme
will be clear about this.
One question I have is, if I plan to just track the
linux-source-x.xx.xx package, should I import that source into my Git
tree, or just maintain the patches?
Thanks.
Kumar
