This is something beyond my understanding. Other distributions, such
as Linux Mint, Ubuntu etc. also do not possess those patches and
config changes. My hunch is that the Cherry Trail processors may not
be considered popular enough for inclusion in mainline at least
yet. So, we are going with this approach for now. Naturally, when
that's done, we'll offer a migration path to the stock Debian kernel
and the need for this hack will be gone.
Thanks.
