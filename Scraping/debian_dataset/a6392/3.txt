Please note, that a web interface (Weblate) is now online for some 
debian-installer translations:
See https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-installer/
If you prefer to translate via such webinterface in the future, instead of 
handling po files and committing to subversion repository directly, feel free 
to mail me. I could activate Weblate for your language too, if you want.
Best regards
Holger
