BLAS/LAPACK providers with 32-bit index have to stay in the archive for
a while for compatibility. And BLAS/LAPACK maintainers will have enough
time to align all the affected pacakges and diagnoze with possible
problems.

I have no ETA. 32-bit and 64-bit index version of BLAS/LAPACK packages
are expected to co-exist for a while. Only when all the reverse
dependencies don't break with 64-bit index version should we consider
dropping the 32-bit index version.
