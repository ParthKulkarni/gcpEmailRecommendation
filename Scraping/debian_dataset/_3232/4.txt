Tsk, naughty.
You know this violated a "must" clause of the Policy, that's there for a
good reason?  And that you were warned that this is illegal, with a proposed
solution (as ninja[build] is a tool used from command line a lot, while
ninja[intrusion detection] is a daemon never ran other than via
/etc/init.d/ninja) -- but somehow ignored that.
Someone please hand me a time machine so I can file a bug on 2012-09-17
then close it on 2016-12-20.
Meow!
