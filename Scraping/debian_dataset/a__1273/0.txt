This apparently is referring to apm-mustang rather than arm64 in
general...
I don't much about that platform, but there doesn't appear to be any
mention of enabled USB in arch/arm64/boot/dts/apm/apm-mustang.dts in
linux 4.9.x. There's mention of it in the apm-storm.dtsi which it
includes, but it's marked as disabled there.
So, unless it's implemented outside of the device-tree, or I'm
misreading that, I'd say it's safe to say it's still disabled.
