I like dput-ng a lot and I'm using it.  However, I'm *frequently*
observing failed uploads when sitting behind weak connections.  I guess
it is a bit hard to debug and so instead of filing a bug report was to
rsync to some host with a good connection and dput(-ng) from there.
BTW, I did several uploads today and a single one of statsmodels did
not arrived somewhere - seems the same case as OP had.  I do not have
the power as Julien to try
   ssh usper.debian.org grep statsmodels
and so I tried again with a source upload.
To answer Mattias question why not using source uploads all the time:
Once I have build the package to see whether all those lintian issues
are fixed I want to fix I have a sensible package to upload and somehow
this workflow to upload what is just there remains.
Lets see what happens now but I suspect that there is some issue and
wanted to provide an additional example.
Kind regards
        Andreas.
