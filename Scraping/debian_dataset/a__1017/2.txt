 But it also makes administrator to remember it harder as its trade-off...
 (and they maybe choose easy password as a result). It's a not good idea
 to suggests to change root password periodically, IMO. It's not a best

 1) Add password check feature whether password has an enough strength
    like RHEL's anaconda or SUSE's installer.
 2) Drop suggestion root password change periodically from message.
 is better.
