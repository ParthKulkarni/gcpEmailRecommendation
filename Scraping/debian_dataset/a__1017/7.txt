Do you (or anyone else) change the locks on your car or front door
at regular intervals? This is really the gist of the OP's report.
Poor passwords stay poor. Good passwords do not deteriorate over
time, so why change them? (Periodically changing one poor password
for another poor password is an interesting idea).
The question has been asked before; #656509.

    Are you ready to handle the round of updates for over
    sixty languages, for a very debatable and cosmetic change?
    I am not, sorry.
  Cyril Brulebois says:
    Neither am I, so I'll just close this bug report for now.
It is a nice debating point but I am inclined to go along with this
assessment when it comes to the installer. Nobody takes any notice
of the advice anyway and there are far more important things to
attend to. Let this report suffer the same fate as the previous one,
