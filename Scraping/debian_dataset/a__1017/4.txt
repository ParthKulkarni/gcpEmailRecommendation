Hi,
>> A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
>> and should be changed at regular intervals.
 Now debian-installer recommends to change root password periodically, however,
 nowadays it SHOULD NOT. e.g. NIST publishes Digital Identity Guidelines,
 in "5.1.1.2 Memorized Secret Verifiers" it says
> Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring 
> mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively 
> repeated characters) for memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT 
> require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically). 
 see https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html
 We should follow it to provide secure environment for users, at least.
 Patch attached.

  The root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this
  empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user
  account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo"
