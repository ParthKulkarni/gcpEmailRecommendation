On Tegra chips, nouveau seems to be used for rendering only.  The
display controller is driven by tegra-drm, which we already include in
the installer (for both arm64 and armhf).

Can you check whether u-boot is updating the simple-framebuffer device
tree node?  There should be a
/proc/device-tree/chosen/framebuffer@<address> directory containing
status, width, height, etc.  That would help to isolate the problem to
either u-boot or the kernel.
