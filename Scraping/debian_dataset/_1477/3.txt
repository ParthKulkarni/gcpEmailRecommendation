Seems basically OK.

I agree that it ought to work, but what testing have you done of this?
Have you confirmed that the LV is marked as locked in partman and can't
be changed using manual partitioning operations?  What happens with
automatic partitioning?
(iso-scan will already provoke this kind of situation for ordinary
partitions, of course, but LVM partitioning is different enough that I'd
like to know that it's been explicitly checked.)

Nit: it's worth ">/dev/null 2>&1" here, as "type" writes to stderr if
the command isn't available, and that's probably just noise in the logs.
