Duh... this change has even been discussed on the mailing list. I think
it's partly fixed already in git but still there's a big misunderstanding.
Hideki, when Ben Hutchings suggested to use "command -v" it means "command
-v apt-config" and not "apt-config -v".
But really the code that went into 1.0.96 is completely wrong. Basically
you tested whether "apt-config -v >/dev/null" is a non-empty string. And
yes it's a non-empty string. :-)
I pushed a proper fix to git.
Cheers,
