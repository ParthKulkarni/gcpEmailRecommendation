Looking at the timestamps, it appears starting with 4.2.0, only gz and
lz was provided, and again for 4.2.1 that was the case, and then in
the middle of June this year (so some 7 months after the 4.2.0 release)
someone went and added xz archives as well, probably because they used
to have them, and someone asked to keep having them.
So they used to be gz and xz only, then went to gz and lz only, and then
later had xz added back again so they now have 3 types.  Seems good in
the end.
No idea what compression options were used, but certainly the lz looks
a good chunk smaller than the xz for those archives.
