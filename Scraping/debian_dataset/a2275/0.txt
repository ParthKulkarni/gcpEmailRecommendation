Package: tasksel
Version: 3.39
Severity: serious
Control: block -1 by 846002
Since revision 3.39, tasksel limits the tasks to a predefined list in
the installer, which ignores the blends task selection currently under
CTTE discussion in #846002. The result of the discussion is still open,
and this bug is created to mark tasksel as a potential target of the
CTTE decision. BTW, I usually would have expected that all parties keep
the status quo during the discussion until a decision is made; trying to
undermine the discussion result is IMO improper and unfriendly behaviour.
The change (ba4e0289) also makes it more difficult for others to add
items to the installer tasksel menu for customized builds without a
technical reason. And any CTTE decision will anyway make the patch obsolete.
Best regards
Ole
