The points I made in my mail were made before, during participant
recruitment, and these "researchers" ignored them.
That suggests to me that that they are more interested in getting
their assignment done, than in producing useful research; and they
don't care whether that means their "research" misrepresents reality.

Being excluded from this kind of research, and having our opinions
therefore ignored, and having that not at all acknowledged, is a
serious threat to the Free Software movement.
"Research" like this paints a distorted picture.  That distorted
picture will form the basis of decisions which will harm our goals.
That the authors did not intend to take sides against me, does not
mean that they have not done so.  They were warned about this problem
and have ignored it.  Overall, their work is a hostile to me.
I agree that this was probably a student project.  But they don't give
the details of their teachers - neither earlier, nor now.  If they had
done, an appropriate response would have been to raise the matter with
the teachers.
What they are doing instead is publishing their work with their
university's name all over it, as if it were respectable piece of
academic work.  Which it clearly isn't.  It fails even the most basic
tests in presentation and content.
