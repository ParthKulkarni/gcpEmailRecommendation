While Ian's way of saying things is quite brutal, truth is he makes his
point.
The piece of work done by Asavaseri Natnaree and their internship directors
is quite disappointing, especially when one knows that none of them did take
any time to reply/address the remarks that were done to them.
First, they didn't take into account the censorship people apply to
themselves regarding surveys hosted by a stalking platform.
Second, they cared more about the prettiness of their report than about its
accessibility and thoroughness. (it's funny that the work is published on
github, btw)
Third, there is no scientific method described in this presentation. (how
were the questions chosen, what is to be concluded from the answers, etc)
When one publishes "research" with a professor's and many assistant
professors' names in it, it seems plausible to assume that someone did
review the work. The fact that the outcome is quite poor is at best
worrying. Either they didn't give a single care to Asavaseri Natnaree's
work, or the "intern" should really consider doing an internship elsewhere.

It's far easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.
