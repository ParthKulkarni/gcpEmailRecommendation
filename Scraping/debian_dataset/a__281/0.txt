One problem with this solution[1] is that the usual way to reach out to 
the maintainer is via the mail listed in the Maintainer field. Suppose we 
have the debian-multimedia@l.d.o list for discussion, and we started 
using team+debian-multimedia@t.d.o as Maintainer: address. How is a 
random user supposed to find debian-multimedia@l.d.o ?
[1] Even if we assume the tracker gains the ability to forward mails to 
the team members.
