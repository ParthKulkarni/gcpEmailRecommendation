A mailing list is not just helpful to distribute e-mails to certain
people.  The mail archive feature is a very valuable thing to refer to
previous mails which as far as I understand is not provided by
tracker.d.o.  That's why I do not consider tracker.d.o as a full
replacement.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
