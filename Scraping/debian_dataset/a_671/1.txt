Mostly at the 'collecting information' stage; about what hard-coding
exists and what requirements there might be etc.

I wrote a couple of sketches of possible ideas here:
https://wiki.debian.org/SuitesAndReposExtension#Possible_solutions
FYI the repository format page has moved here:

Help on this is very much welcome as I don't have much time for it.
Go through as many Debian services as possible, look for hard-coding of
suites, codenames, architectures, compression formats etc and add it to
the SuitesAndReposExtension wiki page and send patches to reduce
hard-coding by getting architecture info from the archive or
suites information from the ftp-master API.
