The later questions are mostly conditional on the state of the installer
at the time they are asked, so one cannot do a simple-minded automatic
reordering.
Some of them are really about the state of the archive (e.g. the tasksel
menu) which could be pre-processed and then asked early (if we don't
mind losing the option of updating the tasks after the media are built).
Others are things where we could just decide to ask early in a
handcrafted ask-early.udeb that then preseeds the later questions to
avoid them being asked mid-install.
Working out how to ask about partitioning before one knows what disks
are available is not going to be fixed by either approach though.
Cheers, Phil.
