If you _really_ want to do this (and I don't think it's possible) then
you can have a super easy - "Oh, you're in the UK, so you want UK
timezone, British keyboard" where you click on a map and highlight UK
and click OK / hit Enter
This is very similar to the first run of something like MacOS
but - it doesn't cater for minority languages, where you might want to
set your machines to a fixed timezone without daylight saving time ...
To be honest, real simplification may add hidden complexity

It would be handy for laptops / dual boot machines if something would
flag up - "You have another operating system here, installed using UEFI.
Stop, check, enter OK twice to continue" because it's easy for people to
mess this step up.

If we're gradually moving to suggest installations connected to a
network and netinst or similar, yes, 99% of the time this question is
useless to installers.
It might be worth relegating it to expert install and changing our
instructions to say something like: "Debian easy install works well
where there is a possibility of using a wired connection and a steady
speed  network. We don't recommend initial iinstall using wireless
because that will involve installing firmware for the installation to
continue. In all other cases / where there is no established network
connetion, please use the expert installation method"

A CentOS 7 install also will allow you to miss setting up a network -
the question is a bit hidden - at which point you reboot and have no
connectivity :( The CentOS install is also now (mostly) graphical - the text mode installer
is worse than ours is - and that disadvantages any of our folk living
with visual impairments, potentially.
All the best,
