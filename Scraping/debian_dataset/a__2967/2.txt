To be frank, I'm a little surprised that debuerreotype is believed to
be the blocker here -- I replied via mail to Ansgar (which I now see
you got dropped from CC on -- my apologies, that mail is at [1]), and
uploaded debuerrotype 0.7 [2], which implements the behavior he's
described (explicitly using "--merged-usr" / "--no-merged-usr" instead
of relying on the implicit default).

[2]: https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2018/06/msg00179.html
Then, I realized he was actually describing what the behavior in
_debootstrap_ should be, and I sent an initial debootstrap patch to
the list [3] fixing the implementation bug (which Hideki [4] turned
into a merge request at [5]).

[4]: https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2018/06/msg00190.html
[5]: https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap/merge_requests/12
IMO, that merge request needs some review and an upload and then this
bug will be fixed properly in debootstrap too.  I think the only
points in question are whether defaulting the variable to the empty
string (and adjusting that empty default based on suite later where we
actually know it) is the desired approach and what to do with
EXTRACT_DEB_TAR_OPTIONS / adding "-k" (from bug 838388) [6].
