Dear maintainers,
With a recent upload of debootstrap the autopkgtest of debuerreotype
version 0.6-1 started to fail. See:
https://ci.debian.net/packages/d/debuerreotype/
and
https://qa.debian.org/excuses.php?package=debootstrap
I looked at the test¹ and it compares the result of the current run of
debuerreotype with a stored hash. Luckily debuerreotype use diffoscope
to investigate the delta. It seems that debuerreotype is hit by this
change in debootstrap:
  * Enable merged-/usr by default (Closes: #839046)
    This is applied for buster and later.
I am not sure if this should NOT have let to a change in debuerreotype,
as I believe that is testing stretch.
On top of that, I wonder if this test is sensitive to changes in the
security archive.
Currently this regression is delaying the migration of debootstrap to
testing by 13 days. Could we please discuss together what the best way
forward is for this regression in testing? (Just so you know, I am
empowered to have the migration software ignore the results of this
specific test if we all agree this isn't a regression that should block
debootstrap).
