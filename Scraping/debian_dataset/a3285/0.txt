These errors are from the flash-kernel hook rather than the kernel
package. You seem to be running stable so I have tagged it as being in
the stable version (3.79) and reassigned. Please let me know if this is
an incorrect assumption.
It says it is looking for "kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb" and from [0] the
file /usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-marvell/kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb is
present in the package -- I suppose it is also present on your
filesystem?
The message:
    Couldn't find DTB  in /usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-marvell or /etc/flash-kernel/dtbs
is interesting since the double space in "DTB  in" is supposed to
contain $dtb_name, i.e. the path to look for, but it doesn't not.
Please could you attach the full output of running `sh -x
/usr/sbin/flash-kernel`, maybe that will include a clue as to where
things have gone astray.
There is also the warning from line 155 of `functions` is
`machine="$(get_dt_model)"` where:
    PROC_DTMODEL="${FK_PROC_DRMODEL:-/proc/device-tree/model}"
    [...]
    get_dt_model() {
            cat "$PROC_DTMODEL"
    }
Assuming you haven't had cause to override FK_PROC_DRMODEL (note typo
in there), does /proc/device-tree/model exist on your system, and if so
what does it contain? The output of `cat -vet /proc/device-tree/model`
might be informative since it will escape any special characters and
make them visible. I suspect this is a harmless trailing nul and it
seems like it is correctly deciding to use kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb so
this "ignored null byte" message may just be a benign warning.
Ian.
