... this.
Looking at uses of dtb in you trace:
    $ grep dtb ~/tmp/flash-kernel-log.txt
    [...]
    + dtb_name=kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb
    + '[' -n kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb ']'
    + echo 'Using DTB: kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb'
    Using DTB: kirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb
So dtb_name is successfully assigned and reported here.
    + handle_dtb
    + '[' xkirkwood-sheevaplug.dtb = x ']'
    + local dtb
    + local dtb_name
But here it is redeclared as a local shadowing the original, but
unassigned.
    ++ find_dtb_file
    ++ local dtb
    ++ case "$dtb_name" in
    +++ find /etc/flash-kernel/dtbs -name
    ++ dtb=
    ++ dtb=
    ++ error 'Couldn'\''t find DTBÂ Â in /usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-marvell or /etc/flash-kernel/dtbs'
    ++ echo 'Couldn'\''t find DTBÂ Â in /usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-marvell or /etc/flash-kernel/dtbs'
    Couldn't find DTBÂ Â in /usr/lib/linux-image-4.9.0-3-marvell or /etc/flash-kernel/dtbs
    and we end up using the blank version here.
    I have a suspicious this was introduced by the fix to #836697 in [0]
    which seems to have added the shadowing "local dtb_name".
    It's a bit naughty but if you edit /usr/share/flash-kernel/functions
    and  near the top of handle_dtb() change the:
    	    local dtb
    	    local dtb_name
    into
    	    local dtb
    	    local dtb_name=$(basename $dtb_name)
    and then remove the "dtb_name=$(basename $dtb_name)" from both halves
    of the following if statement, does that fix it?
    Martin, does that fix seem correct to you?
    I think the "local dtb" bit could also move into the else have with the
    "dtb=$(find_dtb_file)" as well, but that would be an unrelated change.
    This ultimately seems to be down to a difference in the behaviour of
    /bin/dash vs /bin/bash, which I suppose is why it has not been widely
    seen:
    $ cat > t.sh <<EOF
    c() {
    Â Â Â Â echo "c.a = \"$a\""
    }
    b() {
    Â Â Â Â local a
    Â Â Â Â echo "b.a = \"$a\""
    }
    a() {
    Â Â Â Â local a=foo
    Â Â Â Â echo "a.a = \"$a\""
    Â Â Â Â b
    Â Â Â Â c
    }
    a
    EOF
    $ dash t.sh 
    a.a = "foo"
    b.a = "foo"
    c.a = "foo"
    $ bash t.sh
    a.a = "foo"
    b.a = ""
    c.a = "foo"
    I s    uppose you have /bin/sh as a link to /bin/bash on your systemÂ still.
    So an alternative workaround would probably be "sudo dpkg-reconfigure
    dash" and make dashÂ the system shell.
        Ian.
