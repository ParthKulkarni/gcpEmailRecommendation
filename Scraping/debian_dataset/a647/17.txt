No, but various problems quickly arise:
- no new arch can build it.
- if a bug needs to be fixed in it for ports it can't be built.
- if it is involved in a transition, it can't be rebuilt, thus holding
  the transition for those archs.
- ftpmasters don't like lingering binaries.
A temporary solution could be to upload the previous version under a
different source package name, but that builds the same binary packages,
and only on archs which don't have rust (yet). Such package won't get
upstream updates etc. but it doesn't need to enter testing anyway.
