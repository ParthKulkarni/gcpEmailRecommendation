There was some coordination but the coordination was for release
architectures. The coordination was with the Release Team and not with
whoever maintains ports. See https://bugs.debian.org/907626
I guess to some degree I consider the ports to be as much or as little
a part of Debian as nonfree is. Officially, they aren't part of a
strict definition of Debian, but they are part of the broader Debian
ecosystem.
It's difficult for me to even know how to raise issues with ports. I
filed https://bugs.debian.org/908600 for a fairly minor package 2
months ago. I guess I did that sort of right except I only did the
usertag for kfreebsd and not for hurd. I even did some minor
enablement work for mutter for hurd/kfreebsd recently but I'm
absolutely not a porter and I've never used those ports.
Thanks,
