I think this is a misconception. It is true that any possibly ugliness
will not go away, and increasing it does not make it substantially
uglier. But epochs have the same functional bad effects regardless of
a pre-existing epoch, so the fact that there is one already is no good
excuse to just bump it.

In this case though, I think it was certainly appropriate.
Thanks,
