Version: 3.44
Severity: important
X-Debbugs-CC: debian-boot@lists.debian.org
Dear d-i developers and tasksel maintainers,
Package "kdesudo" has been removed in Debian since September 2017.
Tasksel still recommends non-existent "kdesudo" in task-kde-desktop. Please 
consider removing this entry from "Recommends: " field.
However, I noticed the following lines in debian/control:
================
Package: task-kde-desktop
Architecture: all
Description: KDE
 This task package is used to install the Debian desktop, featuring
 the KDE desktop environment, and with other packages
 that Debian users
 expect to have available on the desktop.
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, 
	task-desktop,
	kde-standard,
	sddm,
Recommends:
[...]
# desktop network setup
	plasma-nm,
# This is configured by d-i to be used to gain root on systems with
# no root password. It is not enabled by default.
	kdesudo,
# Package management.
	apper,
[...]
============================
I am wondering how d-i is handling privilege escalation with kdesudo's removal 
in Debian 10. Should this entry be removed anyway or is there any 
alternatives?
Thanks!
