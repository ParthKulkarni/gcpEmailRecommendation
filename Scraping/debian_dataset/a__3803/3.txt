Why? OK this was late and maybe I wasn't clear on IRC, but keeping the
i18n + l10n part working is important.

It might mean a regression on kfreebsd-* (I don't see an eject-udeb binary
on hurd). I'm adding debian-bsd@ and debian-hurd@ in copy.

While non-Linux issues aren't usually a blocker, I wouldn't welcome a
gratuitous breakage there. I'll let porters comment first.
The i18n/l10n part going away would be a blocker though.
