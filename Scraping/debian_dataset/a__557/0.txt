Indeed, I see how one can be surprised at first. It happened to me too a
few years ago! ;)
Those are only useful (therefore built) on a few architectures. You can
see that in the Architecture field of their debian/control file. If
you're looking at l10n changes, (source-)uploading looks good. But maybe
keep an eye on the build logs to make sure there are no new FTBFSes
(failure to build from source):
  https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=arcboot-installer
  https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=s390-dasd
  etc.
It's a good idea to do so for things you've built locally, but it can
be a bit of a burden to check all packagesâ€¦ I'll end up seeing what
packages don't migrate on the long run, so I'll notice anyway. Anyone
can, looking at the udebs (second part) with an old age:

Sometimes the previous uploader has an unclean git tree, and include
some extraneous files, which then show up as deletions. Rebuilding a
source package from the 0.33 git tag, I see these changes when compared
against the one in the archive:
 aclocal.m4   |  171 --
 config.guess | 1530 ----------------------
 config.sub   | 1782 --------------------------
 configure    | 4035 -----------------------------------------------------------
 4 files changed, 7518 deletions(-)
â€¦ which you can in turn ignore.

Right, I can do that.

Feel free to upload that one.

Not an expert here, I'd check with Vagrant.

Is that the right package?

Either way, we don't really support lilo, soâ€¦ ;)

I'd defer to l10n-knowledgeable people for that one. :)

Right package?
