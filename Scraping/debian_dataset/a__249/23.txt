This sounds to me like what Ubuntu does. Packages need to clear
autopkgtest testing and library transitions need to complete before
packages migrate from "-proposed" to the regular development archive.
I believe this approach has significantly improved the quality and
usability of Ubuntu's development release since it was implemented a
few years ago.
I admit I mostly use Ubuntu. In my Debian environment, I usually run
Testing (except for building packages) because it avoids a
considerable amount of the pain that shows up in Unstable. If an
unstable-proposed system were implemented, I expect I would happily
upgrade my Debian install to Unstable.
Thanks,
