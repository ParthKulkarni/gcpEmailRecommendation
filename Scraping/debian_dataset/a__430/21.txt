Yes I'm also concerned about that; we (Debian Developers) have been discussing
that issue for a long time.  A Debconf prompt is probably better, but it's also
more invasive and those are meant to be avoided unless necessary.
And in this case the issue started with a Debian VM running in VirtualBox on a
Windows host.  *shrug*

Looking at the code, I think this is already the case.
In the source package for VirtualBox in Sid I see text for warnings related to
this in translation files such as
src/VBox/Frontends/VirtualBox/nls/VirtualBox_eu.ts; however they don't appear in
src/VBox/Frontends/VirtualBox/nls/VirtualBox_en.ts.  The VirtualBox_en.ts and
qt_en.ts files are significantly shorter than other translations, but I think
that's due to the English translation being built-in.
