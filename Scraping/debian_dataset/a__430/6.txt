It's pretty easy to miss messages in postinst scripts; sometimes a few
hundred go flying past and some of them print information that is noise
at best. Something this important probably ought to be a message in the
GUI somewhere, since people expect to interact with VirtualBox via GUI.
The cpu-checker package in Ubuntu might be worth stealing. The kvm-ok
script runs a handful of small checks to try to diagnose if KVM-based
virtualization acceleration will work or not:
$ kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
