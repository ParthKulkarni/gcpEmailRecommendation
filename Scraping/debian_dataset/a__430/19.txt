Yes, it was a bad default in the laptop's BIOS (VT-something was
disabled).  HP's bug, obviously, but it would have made for a better
experience if the Debian installer had complained in a comprehensible
manner straight away.

It was a recent laptop, and the user had manually enabled BIOS boot.  The
installer hung with a black screen just after the initial menu.
