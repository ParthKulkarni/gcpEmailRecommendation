Please mention a direct URL, planet has a volatile contentâ€¦ Maybe you're

It seems that's a more detailed version of what you mentioned on May
27th following a release announcement. That really should be turned into
a bug report against src:debian-installer; I'm assuming you could try to
test a patch, which would likely modify build/config/x86.cfg there.
As for stretch r0, this is obviously too late, but we'll get a chance to
backport fixes from buster for point releases.
