As mentioned in the announce: We're doing another d-i upload for the
release anyway.
Not that the latest d-i-n-i upload was a bad thing. It's just going to
be superseded.
(Last two items on my r0 checklist:
d-i
d-i-n-i after d-i
â€¦ and Karsten has committed the d-i fixes for i2c, so we should be go to
go for an upload; need to catch up with some more mails before that
though.)
