install Debian with minimal risk.
I consider myself closer to "newbie" than "expert" as I first saw Linux 
when Squeeze was current. I believe all my computers have had Intel 
processors and I know all use BIOS firmware. I've installed the i386 
flavor of Debian on all without any hardware related problems. Somewhere 
I have a laptop that's likely a decade old which I could make a trial 
install of Stretch later this week if that would be useful. This is 
being typed on a used laptop I believe is ~5 years old with Stretch w/o 
problems.
