Including and excluding are different things
Including extra "countries" may cause offense to people with certain
political sensitivities, but doesn't cause any technical problem for
people in other countries.
So if Debian has a policy that we favour inclusion over exclusion and
that any country can be listed if at least one DD visits there and
confirms it exists, is that political or would that be a policy that can
be defended?
I wonder how long it would be before somebody proposed California or
Scotland?  If they entered the list at the same time as Kosovo (and Hutt
River) then it becomes a lot less political and the focus is not on a
single region.

I would not want to waste time coding something before we have some
consensus about what the community is comfortable with.
