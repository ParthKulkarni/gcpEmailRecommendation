Which in the case I described, would result in a probe that would
succeed followed by a download that was going to take several days.
I'm not trying to claim that it's a common case, but I've also certainly
done many slow installs by over-enthusiastically hitting return and then
remembering that there is a caching server locally that I should have
specified.
Actually, I was assuming that the scenario you describe would provoke
the same behaviour as the user interrupting the slow download, so I
agree that a failed download should also allow one to specify a proxy.
I am sceptical that a reliable test can be constructed that isn't going
to be just doing the download, so if we're going to change things it
should be to deal with all errors that might point at the need for a
proxy, including being aborted by a user during the download.
Cheers, Phil.
