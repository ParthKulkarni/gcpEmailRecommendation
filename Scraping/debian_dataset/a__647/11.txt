There are enough languages whose implementation depends on LLVM that I
think it has to be considered an essential part of a new Debian port. 
I doubt this is a surprise to the RISC-V porters.
Rust was already a build-dependency for our standard desktop
installation, since Firefox uses it.

I do like the proposal of adding a librsvg-c for just the architectures
that don't have Rust (yet).
