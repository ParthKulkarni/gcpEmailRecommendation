Hi,
2018-11-04 01:13 Ben Hutchings:
I think that this is a reasonable assumption in general if the breakage
is small, but I am not sure if this is the case when in one single blow
a few architectures are completely removed from the table (and new
architectures too, until they get a LLVM and Rust port, along with all
other necessary support in other tools).
For example RISC-V / riscv64 will probably not have LLVM ready at least
until the LLVM stable released next March.
Maybe in this case there are other solutions, like keeping librsvg-rust
and librsvg-c for different architectures.
But still, it would be nice to have some reassurance for the people
working in ports that the effort spent will not be swept away from one
day to the next just because of a single package, without further
discussion or trying to find acceptable solutions.
Also, that there's a bit of an irony in this case, not specially funny
for Adrian.  He just made Rust work in new architectures [1], including
the mips* stable-release-supported architectures.  And it's only as a
result of this that a few days later a new src:librsvg implemented in
Rust can be uploaded to unstable, otherwise it couldn't.
So the repayment for him to spend time and make Rust work in many
architectures, is to blow away his work in a lot of other arches.  Not
nice.
