Hello!
With this mail, I would like to protest the uncoordinated upload of the rustified
version of libsrvg to unstable. The maintainer of the package knows very well that
this particular package has a huge number of reverse dependencies and would cause
a lot of problems with non-Rust targets now. He also knows very well that I am very
much interested in Debian Ports and a lot of efforts have been invested there.
I have puts efforts and time into making the Rust compiler available on more architectures
because I also wanted to help with the Rust efforts and this was now directly used against
me because my life in Debian Ports has been made harder with all the manual work
required for maintaining librsvg on the non-Rust targets now.
I'm really annoyed and disappointed by this move and feel really let down by this
behavior. No heads up, no coordination, no nothing.
Is that seriously the way we want to work together?
Adrian
