AFAIK the decruftification is still manual, the archive software does
provide the different versions for different archs. Even for arch:all

proper archs.
But ftp-master doesn't like lingering packages :)

I don't think this question is useful. One indeed doesn't always realize
the consequences one's actions, one can't blame somebody for that, shit
just happens :) Let's just work on finding a workable solution.
