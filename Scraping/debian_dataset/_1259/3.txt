I doubt that this sort of Debian-specific query feature will be
implemented in Gitlab.
If you don't actually need this to work automatically, Salsa/Gitlab
preferences include the option to set your "dashboard" (the front page
when you're logged in) to be "starred projects" rather than "your
projects" (every project you have access to).  You can then select the
star icon for each of the repositories you want to be listed there.
