I suppose. I don't think we test for it though?

Thanks for that.

I guess I am talking about the URL you get from the jump redirector
or the future Apache based system.

A website is a different context than terminal manual page viewing.
The usual convention for headings on the web is either "Title Case" or
"Title case". Also, "UPPER CASE" is commonly thought of as shouting
on the web. Also, the web way looks less jarring in a web browser.

I think that non-monospace should be the default for the same reasons
we should not have upper-case section titles.

I'll leave that to someone more familiar with the project.

Interesting, me either.

I may have misremembered. Either way it is pointless to have 2 links.
Also, it would be good if the index page didn't say 'index' in the page
title, that is jargon that isn't useful.

Not necessarily, for example lists.d.o uses 'mailing lists':
https://lists.debian.org/
'manual pages' is slightly less jargony too.

Hmm, perhaps. What about one line per package name?

I stripped of the end component since URLs are usually hierarchical.

Hmm, ok.
Using suite names means that the URLs last longer.
Codenames disappear after a bunch of years.

$ man foo
No manual entry for foo
Download and view manual page for foo? (Y/n)

IIRC that is 6 times shorter than the archive update frequency :)
IIRC mirror push frequency is the same as archive update frequency.
It is pretty pointless to run it more often than those.
Triggering it on mirror pushes would mean that the second the local
mirror is finished updating, the new manual page generation starts.
> Can you explain the motivation for using incoming/archive please?
Using incoming means that new manual pages are available sooner.
Using archive means that I can still look up old manual pages.

Ick, thanks for the wiki edits.

Great, thanks.

Cool.
