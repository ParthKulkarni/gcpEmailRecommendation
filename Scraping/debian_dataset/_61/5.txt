Package: installation-reports
Severity: normal
I tried doing an install with a Stretch RC1 netinst CD.  Worked fine,
except that later in the install, right before asking about an apt
mirror, the installer asked about scaning additional CDs.  Previous
versions of the netinst installer haven't asked that question; normally
only the full-CD installers ask that.
