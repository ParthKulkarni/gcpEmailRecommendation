Not quite.  The first stage of maintaining packages is that you work as
part of a team, or with sponsor(s), so that someone else reviews and
uploads your work.  Then you can apply to become a Debian Maintainer
and can then be granted permission to upload specific packages
yourself.  Finally, you can apply to become an Debian Developer
(uploading) and you will have permission to upload any packages.
(Those whose contributions don't and won't involve package maintenance
can apply directly to become a Debian Developer (non-uploading).)
