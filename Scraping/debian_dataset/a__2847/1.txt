Would it make sense to set PAGER=more for all of d-i?
Within busybox there's one applet that actually looks at PAGER, which is
man. Of course we don't compile that in. But the hardcoded fallback
again is more, so util-linux's behavior is a little surprising. Given
that we do not actually have less in that environment, but do have more,
shouldn't we be able to give binaries a sensible guidance (in the best
case it being a no-op because more's the default anyhow)?
(I suppose I also have to say that there were many times I missed less
and needed to abuse an editor instead - which isn't necessarily
equivalent in terms of wrapping on the terminal. We could also ponder
adding CONFIG_LESS=y in some minimal build flavor.)
Kind regards
