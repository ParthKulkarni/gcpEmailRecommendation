In Debian, using netinst, we have
- language
- country
- keyboard
- hostname
- domain name, which we could arguably make expert-only, I don't
  remember having to use it.
- password
- username
- timezone, for countries which need it
- confirmation for automatic partitioning
- disk selection
- partitioning layout
- confirmation
then the base system gets installed, then
- prompt for additional CD input
- mirror selection, perhaps we could just use deb.debian.org by default,
  I don't know if that works nice enough nowadays.
- http proxy (yes, one just can't skip it in quite a few places)
- package installation poll (we do want to ask the question)
- task selection
- bootloader installation (we really can not avoid this step, it poses
  too many problems).
and that's it.
That's a bit more items, but not by so much.

I don't really see the difference between that proposal and what we
are already doing except for the questions which are asked after base
installation.

The problem is that some questions really have to be asked, because no
default can really be sanely set, e.g. username.

That actually triggers me another thought: the installers you are
talking about ask basically the same set of questions, not so much
less. The main difference is that they are asked together in a dialog
box. I can understand that this can be less stressing for inexperienced
users: it's easier to leave things as defaults when it's all preset in a
dialog box and you just click "ok" than when one has to answer questions
one after the other, which can be stressing.
I can understand that *that* can make a difference, and that could be
implemented indeed, to preseed the rest of questions. The difficult part
is to make sure that all such questions will be preseeded.
