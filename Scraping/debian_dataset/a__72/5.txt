I recently found simple-cdd to be simple and awesome. I should really
write that blog post I wanted to write about it. One day, hopefully.
That said, I do agree with Wouter's basic assertion that we could and
should make d-i even more easy to use. I was considering filing a
wishlist bug asking for moving that domain question to expert mode.
And for the username, "user" seems to be a rather generic default to me
;)
But then, this would just be patch work. IMO a more wholesome attempt to
improve d-i's UI/UX would be better.
(also and btw, I was wondering how to proceed with the topic of installing
blends from the official+main installer images. Buster will freeze
eventually too ;)
Sorry for mixing 5 topics into one mail. I wish I had more time to spend
on this.
