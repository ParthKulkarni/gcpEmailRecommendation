I believe there is a misunderstanding: I'm not saying that the existing
questions should be modified. I'm saying that the way questions should
be asked in the overview screen that you propose is very different from
the existing questions (basically they'll be extremely simple). And thus
it's not a duplication, since they'll be completely different.
I agree that implementing the overview screen is a much faster step
to have something that doesn't frighten beginners away, rather than
rephrasing our existing questions yet another time. I was really not
suggesting the latter.
