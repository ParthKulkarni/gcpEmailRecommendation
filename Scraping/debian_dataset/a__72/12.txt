Another benefit: 
with a concept like the above it would be possible to prepare everything
beforehand (ask all questions), then start the whole installation, go to
bed and when you wake up in the morning, it's ready. :-)
Especially if you install many packages (by selecting one or more desktop
tasks for example), that would be a real benefit, since the installation
might last a significant time.
With the installer like it is now, you need to stay at the machine, since
there might pop up new questions.
(ok, you can use preseeding for an unattended installation, but that's not
for beginners)
