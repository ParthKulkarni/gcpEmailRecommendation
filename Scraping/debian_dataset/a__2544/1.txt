Everything started by logged-in users is already running unconfined for 
years in most distributions (including debian).
For the daemons (httpd,...), the goal was always to have a policy 
working well enough so they could be confined, but this requires work to 
adjust the policy to work with debian paths and software versions (these 
are moving targets).
My idea at some point was to formalize (a subset of) use cases and test 
these well enough before enforcing the policy only for these. But I 
never had the time to formalize the use cases. Running SELinux all the 
domains in permissive doesn't make a lot of sense IMVHO.
It's a bit of chicken-egg problem here, either we confine everything, 
things break and we have a high risk of people disabling SELinux or we 
put everything in permissive and people doesn't even see that the policy 
is not correct. In both case we have no bug reports, well at least that 
what I was afraid of and that's and why I personally never proposed 
SELinux to be enabled by default.
Also, don't forget that the SELinux team in debian is made of 2 people, 
Russel for the policy and I'm taking care of the userspace.
TL;DR: Not enough time/testing/manpower
