Hello Marco.
Please use a mailinglist for user support. This mailing list is for 
development topics.
For Plasma/KDE related questions I suggest debian-kde mailinglist. CcÂ´d. 
Please drop Cc to debian-devel on your answer.

If you run Debian GNU/Sid, you always, always, read again *always* have to 
carefully check what packages apt dist-upgrade would uninstall, before 
confirming the action. If you are not willing to do this, I suggest you use 
Debian Stable.
Debian Qt/KDE team works an upgrade from Qt 5.7.1 to Qt 5.9.1 and its not yet 
complete. Trying to force a partial upgrade with apt dist-upgrade will 
uninstall Plasma desktop currently. I actually warned about this on debian-kde 
mailinglist this morning. You may like to choose Debian GNU/Buster/Testing 
instead of Sid in order to have *some* protection, as I read about a 
transition on #debian-qt-kde IRC channel and it might very well related to the 
Qt upgrade. I didnÂ´t check this tough.
There is no automatic way to undo the action. I suggest you install again by 
using metapackages like
- plasma-desktop
- kde-standard
- kde-full
depending on the amount of packages you want to have installed.
And then add any additional packages you want to have again.
Thanks,
