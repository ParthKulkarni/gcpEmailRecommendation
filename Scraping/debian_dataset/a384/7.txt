Hi Vagrant,

Yeah, the copypasta is the first thing I noticed after git cloning. I

there is, the easier it'll get to reuse it.
Thanks for the first glance! There's no need to hurry, especially with 
xmas around the corner.
That's the big question. I looked around and found 3 cases where 
distros/downstreams enable symbols, see [1], [2] and [3]. But those 3 
are in a different boat than debian: It's just per family of SoC.
I'm not sure if anything breaks if debian would enable it for its armhf 
multi platform build. I'm currently trying to find out with a solution 
appropriate for the upstream kernel [4], but I'm not sure if that pans out.
That's not going to work, without -@ the "__symbols__" node is missing. 
Without that an overlay can not reference e.g. the alias 'spi0'. You 
need the original dts to include these.
Since I used a boneblack too, you can find my basic overlays attached. 
I'm not a device tree expert, so they might not be correct, but they're 
good enough to test this and see the results (especially since commit [5]).
-setenv bootargs @@LINUX_KERNEL_CMDLINE_DEFAULTS@@ ${bootargs} @@LINUX_KERNEL_CMDLINE@@
  if test -z "${fk_kvers}"; then
It's not, I did that just to be consistent (see 3 lines above). Patch 
can be dropped if you disagree.
-load ${devtype} ${devnum}:${partition} ${kernel_addr_r} ${prefix}vmlinuz-${fk_kvers} \
The purpose of this patch was to allow more deduplication of boot 
scripts, e.g. bootscr.beaglebone and bootscr.sunxi. Both of these 
support overlays with a recent u-boot (well, sunxi soon [6]), but also 
contain this fallback loop for older and/or vendor-shipped versions.
With the reusability of the overlay snippets it's possible to shove all 
of that in another script and use that on those platforms. Would you 
prefer that?
+if test -z "${fk_fdt_cmd}"; then
Oh I tried, but u-boot chokes on it (parser errors out with a syntax 
error at runtime). I don't know if it's not supported or if it's a bug, 
but I just couldn't make it work. I didn't yet report it upstream, but 
even if it's a bug and gets fixed we need a way this works everywhere 
anyway.
I'm not very experienced with u-boot scripts, so you're very much 
welcome to try yourself ;)
Yeah, while this already works great, it's also the part I want to 
improve further. On error, this reloads the dtb file, so it relies on 
the var $fdtpath.
But u-boot's 'fdt' commands allows to copy the tree in memory, that 
would make it cleaner and more robust. I need to explore that though.
