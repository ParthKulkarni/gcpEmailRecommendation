(It's probably reasonable to take this offlist now; no one else has
spoken up as being interested.)

Pulseview 0.2 is already not in testing due to a FTBFS so I wouldn't
worry about it too much. 0.3 already supports QT5 which should make
moving over easier.
I think getting the core sigrok packages up to date is a good first
step; probably in experimental during the freeze as there's a dependency
from collectd on libsigrok2 which we don't want to affect.
You previously mentioned using git-buildpackage; do you have an existing
repo I can look at?
