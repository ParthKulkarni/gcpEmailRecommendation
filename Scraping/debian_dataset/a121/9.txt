Hmm right, this one indeed might be an issue.  We wouldn't be worse off
than the current state, though.  Do you perhaps have any ideas?

A limited VM is ok, as no check looks at /proc or something that may be
missing, just tests on the CPU itself.
As for a foreign machine:
* ISA_IGNORE=y apt install ¬ªpackage¬´
* if installing for a wholly different architecture (and without qemu), the
  check is skipped -- no way to probe the target machine anyway

I thought about it but decided against, as it seemed to me it's a situation
too unlikely to happen (usually it's the big computer installing something
for a SoC or a museal piece) -- at least not likely enough to warrant
confusing new users.
If you guys disagree, though, it's not a big change.
There's a reason why I raised this thread instead of rushing on a mass bug
filing...
