I was asking about e.g. a library which only supports, say, sse2 would
not run without that extension, so no baseline support is present.
In that case should the library package both depend on your new
metapackage _and_ also install to the sse2 hwcap directory, or are you
were suggesting that if you depend on the metapackage then installing
the main base library dir is ok.
The practical difference would be between a library-not-found from the
dynamic linker vs an undef-instruction at runtime (assuming no further
runtime check is present) in the case where a user has chosen to
override the metapackage somehow and is running on an unsupported
platform.
