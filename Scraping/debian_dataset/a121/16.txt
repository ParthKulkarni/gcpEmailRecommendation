A big issue here is that install-time is different than run-time. I see
at least two possible scenarios where this construction fails:
- Motherboard dies, move harddisks to old computer with older CPU,
  suddenly things start failing at run-time again.
- Preparing a Debian image on a fast new machine, use the image on an
  older/embedded device.
Also conversely, trying to install something on an old machine, or in a
limitted VM environment, with the intention of later using it on a newer
machine, will now fail.
While you can do --force-depends to forcibly install a package, it will
result in apt nagging all the time about broken dependencies. Maybe a
debconf question can be asked when installing one of these proposed
packages to allow installation anyway even if the current host machine
does not support the requested instruction set.
