I have started mass-bug-filing for this. Current progress is all
of contrib, about half of main, and none of non-free.
All bugs:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=automake1.11;users=debian-qa@lists.debian.org
automake1.11 only (Severity: normal):
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=automake1.11-only;users=debian-qa@lists.debian.org
automake1.11 | automake or automake1.11 | automaken (Severity: normal):
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=automake1.11-preferred;users=debian-qa@lists.debian.org
automake | automake1.11 (Severity: minor):
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=automake1.11-nonpreferred;users=debian-qa@lists.debian.org
