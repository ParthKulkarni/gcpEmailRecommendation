Here in Debian we often need to coordinate decision making between multiple 
people. Mail list is not a proper instrument to facilitate that task as it is 
difficult to find out where things stand and who is winning the argument.
Loomio [1] is a powerful tool to organize decision making. We have a long 
standing RFP [2] for Loomio and I hope that with help of Ruby team it can be 
packaged without too much effort.
Upstream have a hosted instance that anyone can try right away although I 
believe we should have our own if we are serious about using Loomio.
Thoughts?
