For me: The context.

Nothing in general, but: context.
This whole discussion reminded me of a campaign by the German project
pinkstinks.de called "Sexy yes, sexism no":
https://pinkstinks.de/sexy-oder-sexistisch/
Summary in my words:
It's fine to show a woman in underwear if you try to sell women's
underwear (left picture: "Bra 29 EUR").
It's not ok to show a woman in underwear if you try to sell a chair
(and the scantily clad woman is just decoration / an object to draw
attention to the ad) (right picture: "Chair 199 EUR").
I think that explains the issue of objectification quite well.
Translated to packages:
It's IMO fine to talk about and show breasts in a game which teaches
the names of body parts to children; or in an app that helps women to
detect early warnings signs of breast cancer; or (Ian's example) in
software controlling sex toys; etc. Because there they are simply
on-topic.
And it's IMO not ok to use the boobs theme for a web scraper or other
software unrelated to boobs themselves, where its only function is
to make a small group of users giggle while objectifying, offending
or boring the rest of the world. 
Cheers,
gregor
