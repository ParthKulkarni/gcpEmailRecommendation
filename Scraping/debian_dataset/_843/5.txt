I'd go farther: make UTF-8 guaranteed, and drop all support for ancient
encodings as LC_*.
Unlike exim vs postfix vs ssmtp, systemd vs sysvinit, vi or emacs or a
better editor, xfce vs mate, etc, where each alternative has its upsides,
UTF-8 is basically strictly[1] better for text transmission[2].
As for use, lemme repeat the pretty graphs from January's bug mining:

Ancient encodings don't grant any extra functionality, merely provide compat
for a connector issue -- and per the above graphs, I believe we can drop it. 
During a recent house renovation, my father insisted on having every second
electricity socket have no earthing pin, because it makes it impossible to
use old Soviet-style plugs.  I challenged him to show me one he uses, and it
turned out he did not even have any anywhere on storage.  Here, keeping
compat makes you lose functionality (no earthing when you need it), adds
extra complexity, etc.  Any support for alternatives has such costs: the
question is, do we anything in return?  For MTAs, inits, editors, desktop
environments -- we do.  For locale encodings?  I can't think of an upside.
On the other hand, gains from such droppage would be nice.  An example:
dash, while striving for 100% POSIX compliance, wontfixed a "must"
requirement that ${#variable} returns length in characters not bytes.
If we assume UTF-8, all you need to do is count bytes outside 0x80..0xBF;
if you want to detect malformed data and reinvent the wheel, it takes a page
of code.  But to support ancient encodings, you need complex machinery to
locate and read a file from disk and call such pluggable code.  This was
deemed to be too costly for dash.
There's a lot of other insanity we'd get rid of: what would you say about
people demanding for every /etc/passwd entry to allow a different encoding? 
Or see how badly random Python programs started failing recently because of
some changes to locale handling.  And so on, so on...
Thus, I propose: let's declare all non-UTF-8 locales unsupported. 
Code-wise, a program that doesn't call setlocale() may still use "C"
(changes as to its meaning are up to glibc's upstream[3]), but setting the
env vars to anything non-UTF-8 by the user would no longer be supposed to
work.  We close all such bugs, and ensure that if the user fails to specify
a locale, C.UTF-8 is used.
What would you folks say?
Meow!
[1]. For non-strictly, you need to seek obscure scenarios, such as as purely
Chinese plain text with no markup nor formatting might take slightly less
space when encoded in a two-byte encoding vs usually-three-byte UTF-8.
[2]. Internal processing, such as random access array of codepoints, might
want a fixed-width encoding, but that's orthogonal to outside
representation.  Just convert to UCS-4 or whatever.  Or if you insist you
need only your country's characters and no customer ever will have an umlaut
in name, shoehorn it into a single-byte array, while using UTF-8 outside.
Then there's plenty of other locale handling insanity, but that's again
mostly independent from encoding (other than Unicode giving you more rope to
hang yourself on, like "«≥" or NFD).
[3]. The C standard doesn't say anything about the behaviour of functions
like wcrtomb() or iswalpha() for characters above 0x80 (with the odd
exception of iswblank()), thus replacing "C" with "C.UTF-8" completely
would be compliant, although this is not a part of my proposal here.
