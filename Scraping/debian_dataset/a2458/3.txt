webkit2gtk's API has been stable enough for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Right now, webkit2gtk 2.16.3 is in experimental with fixes for 3
published CVEs that affect Stretch. What is needed for that version to
be allowed in to Stretch now? It is just testing that the rdeps still
work?
By the way, there are more than twice as many Firefox addons in Debian
as there are packages using webkit2gtk. I believe Mozilla has
basically committed to breaking several of those addons next year,
whereas the webkit2gtk developers try to avoid regressions.
