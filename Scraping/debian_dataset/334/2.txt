I think I'll change the package name to fonts-comicneue (as comic isn't
a foundry).

Yes, the upstream repo at
https://github.com/crozynski/comicneue
has UFO source files, but we aren't currently building the fonts from
them. I guess the package has to go into the contrib section, then?
Apart from this, you are of course invited to co-maintain the package,
as I'll put it under the pkg-fonts team umbrella anyway. ;)

Yes, I was going to add a fontconfig entry and add the font as a
replacement for Comic Sans anyway (though I'd use a different set of
rules).
