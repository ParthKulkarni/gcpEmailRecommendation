I'm wondering whether we shouldn't be trying to look at specific
versions of installation-guide based on the target suite, rather than
hoping for the best with ls -t|head -1.
For stretch, it can be obtained with:
| kibi@wolkenstein:~$ rmadison installation-guide -s stretch | awk '{print $3}'
| 20170614
For buster, there's currently no version available in testing, so we
could try to use whatever is in testing, and fall back to unstable if
there's no such version?
(If we implement checking several suites with a fallback, we could even
check stretch-proposed-updates in addition to stretch, which would let
us merge things in advance when a point release is being prepared.)
What do you (-boot & -www) think?
Cheers,
