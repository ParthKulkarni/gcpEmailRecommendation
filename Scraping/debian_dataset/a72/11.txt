So, I've been thinking about how we could implement something like this
without requiring what in essense would be a rewrite of d-i, and this is
what I came up with:
- Create a new udeb for an overview screen, and make it show up early in
  main-menu so it gets run "fairly early"[1].
- In that overview screen, show the status of the "most important"[1]
  settings. Make these populated by files that are written by the
  particular udebs, similar to how partman populates its main menu.
- Allow those udebs that are shown in the overview screen to also set a
  flag file which causes their option in that screen to be marked as
  "confirmation required". You cannot confirm the overview screen until
  none of its options have the "confirmation required" flag set.
- Selecting a particular option in the overview screen causes the
  installer to configure the selected udeb, as though it was selected
  from the main menu.
- Once the user confirms the overview screen, set the debconf priority
  to critical and quit successfully. The installation is handed over to
  main-menu, which will now run normally without asking any questions
  (unless an error occurs).
- If the user selects the option "skip this screen", do not touch the
  debconf priority and quit successfully. The installation is handed
  over to main-menu, which will now run normally, asking questions as
  before.
[1] what consists "fairly early" and "most important" are
    implementational details that can be fine-tuned later on and are not
    important for this discussion.
With that plan, the only changes that would be required would be to:
- Implement the required logic behind the overview screen. Much of this
  could be copied from main-menu
- Make sure that the "skip this screen" option can be easily preseeded,
  so that preseeding still works.
- Modify the relevant udebs so they write their status and optionally an
  "update required" flag file in the right location for the overview
  screen
Everything else would function as before. In a first implementation,
this would already be quite some improvement I think.
In addition, I also think it would be beneficial if we were to add
another type of debconf template that could be used by that overview
screen instead of the "select" template that we use now for main-menu
and partman-base, and which would allow for a more modern and shinier
type of user interface. It could also be used by partman, then.
This can be implemented later, however.
Thoughts?
