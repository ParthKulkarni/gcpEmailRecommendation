Hi Francesco,
I stumbled upon aolserver4 because aolserver4-nsopenssl is bot building
against openssl 1.1 and the former is the only user.
The first upload of aolserver4 4.5.1 was in 2009. I assume that this was
the last release of the server by upstream. The homepage referenced in
the package provides a (port 80 only) redirect to aol.com which does not
mention the server (or I can't find it). The aol.com domain seems to be
served by Apache Traffic Server. I get the feeling that AOL is no longer
looking after its server from the old days.
The popcon for the package is low.
So my question: Can we remove aolserver4 from the archive?
Sebastian
