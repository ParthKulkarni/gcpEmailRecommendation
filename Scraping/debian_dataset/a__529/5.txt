FWIW, I helped Mekeor a bit on IRC originally but since I didn't know
what was wrong I recommended to send an email to debian-boot.

One of the things I see in the logs is:
Apr  8 01:15:46 main-menu[938]: (process:966): ip: SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device
Apr  8 01:15:46 main-menu[938]: (process:966): ip: SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device
but Ethernet is working fine, so I don't think it's a connectivity
issue per se.
One thing I've always wondered about: oldsys-preseed preseeds eth0 as
the default interface and I suspect this is no longer true.  However,
I never looked into changing it since it doesn't seem to cause any
issues.  At least I was able to install stretch fine.
Also, Mekeor had the issue with the jessie and the stretch installer.
It's the first time I saw a QNAP user with this problem and I suspect
we would have heard about it already if it was a common issue.
So I really have no idea. :/
