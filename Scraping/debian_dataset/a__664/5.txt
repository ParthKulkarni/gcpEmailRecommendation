I think this should be relatively easy to compute:
  if ! -e pkg.buildinfo
    â†’ rebuild
  elif dpkg-dev not in pkg.buildinfo
    â†’ rebuild
  elfi dpkg-dev < 1.18.17 in pkg.buildinfo
    â†’ rebuild
?
And, hey, just today I stumbled upon this
<https://salsa.debian.org/bremner/built-with> :), which might perhaps
be a nice starting point.
Thanks,
