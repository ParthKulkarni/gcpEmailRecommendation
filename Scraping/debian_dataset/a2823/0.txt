I subscribe to and read -user, where quite a large number of posts have
recently discussed the state of installing from a live image. I have
also seen reports of the efforts being made to mitigate the situation,
particularly by Steve McIntyre. So I became a bit grumpy, a mood which
is not good when contributing to a bug report. Apologies if I gave the
impression user contributions are unwelcome.
Perhaps
  https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/06/msg00335.html
brings some perspective to the matter. The more users who use live
images and report bugs in the pre-release phase, the better the image
quality will become.
