That doesn't solve the problem of the obsolete conffile breaking grub,
though. Should the grub maintainers edit the conffile in-place as
suggested (a Policy violation), or delete it or move it out of the way
(also a Policy violation), or is there some other escape route possible
here?
It occurs to me that asking the CTTE for advice might be useful: they'd
probably find it a refreshing change to have a question that is not a
request to choose one side of a heated dispute between developers :-)
