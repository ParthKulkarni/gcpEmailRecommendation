Oh, the "original" message is seperate, I just replied to a reply.
I can't find the original message in the archives, and I already deleted
it, but if anyone uses gmail they might find a bunch of "originals"
in their "[Gmail]/Spam" folder.
The original messages also had a subject line with "Re:" in them, but
there was no quoted text.
Looking at them now, it is quite likely that the replies to the original
messages are from the same source.
