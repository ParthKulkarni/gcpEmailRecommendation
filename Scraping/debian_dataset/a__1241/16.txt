FWIW it's been a long time since I had any problems in this regard,
and I'm surprised it's still an issue among knowledgeable people by
2017!
My last two laptops (bought in 2009 and 2013, IIRC) have been of the
Acer Aspire One range. Both, bought at a supermarket, for around
US$300. Both worked completely flawlessly since day one; I admit to
having b0rked several things (power management included) due to my
configurations, but I'm now used to it "just working" - I last
clean-reinstalled this computer maybe two years ago, and I just push
the lid down, it always suspends properly.
