You're not alone.
It is a Hit/Miss situation. When you hear a hardware advertised as, "Works well
with Linux", it is important to investigate which Linux ?
Because Debian is pure, others are not. Debian mostly relies on fixes that have
reached the upstream kernel. Many others do not.
Once you overcome that, you still have the binary firmware's behavior to deal
with. Lucky you, if all those combinations, together, work fine for you.
Debian should have a Hardware Certification process in place. That'll help a lot
many users.
