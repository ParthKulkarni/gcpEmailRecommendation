Maybe I'm just exceedingly unlucky, but I have yet to find a laptop
where all of the following works:
- Suspend
- Hibernate
- Airplane-mode Hotkey (especially hard apparently)
- Volume Hotkeys
- Brightness Hotkeys
- Suspend/hibernate hotkeys
- Hot-plug of external monitor
>From memory, some of the models I tried and found lacking: Asus EeePC,
Lenovo Carbon X1, HP Elitebook from ~3 years ago, HP Elitebook from just
now.
Suggestions for the next purchase are welcome :-).
(but probably better off-list)
Best,
-Nikolaus
