One way to add the key to the known_hosts is to say "yes" when ssh asks
you if the fingerprint matches and that command shows you the
fingerprint for you to match the one ssh prints against. Perhaps a bit
roundabout compared with just appending the key to the file, but not at
all unreasonable IMHO, and certainly better practice than saying yes
without checking.
