Please let's not. /etc/mtab is a thing of the past, and nothing should use it
any more. util-linux had been the primary reason for still having it in jessie,
but in testing util-linux, systemd, udisks, etc. completely ignore that file
(aside from the backwards compat jobs to create it if not present).
After wheezy's release I would rather drop the /etc/mtab creation bit from
systemd, and FAI should do the same.
