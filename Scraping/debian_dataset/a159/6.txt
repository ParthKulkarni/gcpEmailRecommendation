That's my tentative conclusion also. There is a commonality to all these
“don't send me this spam” messages, that essentially combine a plausible
complaint top-posted on a quoted spam message.
I think the best explanation is that the entire message – complaint and
quoted part – were composed and sent by the spammer themselves.
