That's correct.  gbp pq is equivalent to maintaining the upstream patches
as a Git branch that you rebase against each new upstream version.  You
retain some history of changes to those commits (unlike a pure git rebase
branch) in commit messages of the exported patches, but only as the commit
messages on commits of diffs (so not hugely human-readable).

I like it because quilt is a fairly primitive revision control system, so
while it has tools for rebasing patches, they're not very good compared to
git rebase.
