If you want to try that with Ben's patched file, you _ought_ to be able to
do so by specifying this on the boot commandline (assuming I've made no typos):
  url=http://hands.com/d-i/bug/820818/preseed.cfg
Note that this does not include a safe exit.  If someone tells me where
that needs to go (I've only glanced at the code so far) then I'll add
it.
I've not tried this bug-fix script yet, so there might be typos, or the
obvious race condition might actually be a issue, but this kludge
normally works, and it should at least provide you with inspiration for
how to do it repeatably without having to suffer editing with nano.
