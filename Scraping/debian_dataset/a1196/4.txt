I think concept of "volatile" is better, stronger.
PPA allows people to ship whatever they want without cooperating in policy 
compliant (official) repo. This is the Debian way where many people work 
together in one centralized resource.
Many people working in many places (PPA) will undermine cooperativeness and 
trust - a something we can only have in backports-like "volatile" repo.

The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate,
contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive, and
unrealistic. Belief in myths allows the comfort of opinion without the
discomfort of thought.
