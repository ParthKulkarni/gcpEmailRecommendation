Thank you.  That would be awesome.
I am very sorry that Debian is a toxic environment for this kind of
work.  As someone who has a lot of investment in Debian I find it very
sad.
TBH I have been head-in-the-sand about much of this, because I find
these kind of discussions in Debian fora so unpleasant.  I think it's
only a minority who make personal attacks and generate negative
energy, but it's awful.
Please come to debian-init-diversity@chiark.greenend.org.uk.

Great.
I will sponsor your uploads to Debian.
Ian.
