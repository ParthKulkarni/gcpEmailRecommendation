I'm also guilty of calling MikeeUSA a toxic person, also a horrible
personal attack.  For me enough Devuan-related people have managed to
end up in the same category by hard work.  I don't think it's
coincidence that the "VUA" liked MikeeUSA's writings about why systemd
is so evil.
If some people consistently call others a "cancer", accuse them of
"vandalizing" open source, spread obvious FUD and so on, then I don't
think they would fit in well in Debian's culture where they would have
to accept that packages such as systemd exist.
And no, it's not just that infobot factoid or just random people that are
totally unrelated to Devuan.
(Yes, I know Devuan eventually banned MikeeUSA for his writings.)
