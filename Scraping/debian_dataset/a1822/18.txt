Thanks… will follow up on those I read up on in the web interface
(why is there no NNTP interface like in GMane, where I could retrieve
individual messages by Message-ID to easier reply to?) below.
I think we can drop d-backports now, though?

I’m not sure, but I’d rather not, as a general case, unless there’s
one or more of theirs who’s willing to cooperate and able to keep
quality. Devuan is… questionable, when one’s used to all of Debian.

Several people have said they believe that to be the end of Devuan,
and I concur, from what I’ve read.

This takes distributed manpower. Maintainers do not use all packages.
Bugs are spotted by people actually using them (though, if they can
be reproduced easily, can then be tackled by others). My uses are
probably not very normal, though…

Hmm. This does not answer the question, while it does point out one
package. I’d rather sysvinit not depend on insserv, it used to work
fine without that kind of added complexity, and AIUI, it was only
used for parallel boots (I have /etc/init.d/.legacy-bootordering on
all systems so I don’t use that anyway), and boot speed fetishists
have largely migrated to systemd (which *does* boot up rather fast,
even if its shutdown procedures are…).
Does anyone know any offhand reason to not drop the insserv integration?

Can you please RM the experimental version and close those bugs, if
that version is abandoned, since you seem to know more about this?
What does “meant for buster is ok” mean? It’s a bug that needs action
in sid?

I’ve volunteered to help out earlier in the thread, within constraints
(but rather that than to see things go and break).
