Marvin,

This appears to be already in the archive in a number of places.
For example, in `debdate`, `debian-handbook` or even in the `debian-
timeline` package if you speak XML.. Naturally, these are not as
convienent as a simple text file, so I am simply pointing them out.

To avoid conflation of topics, this sounds like this should be a
separate wishlist bug, at least in the first instance.
Best wishes,
