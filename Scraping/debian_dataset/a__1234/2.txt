But why would Ã¼ not be part of the sorting? Yes, that was my example
before you censored my thought process - In Spanish, [Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº] and
[aeiou] share the same spot while ordering, as do Ã± and n, as do u and
Ã¼ (and we have no further diacriticals). I understand that German
sorts Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼ at the end.
But... Ok, lets stick to 7-bit ASCII as defined. When I was in primary
school, "ch" and "ll" were treated as single letters (sorted
respectively between "c" and "d", and between "l" and "m". So,
thinking with an Ubuntu slant, we would have cow < cheetah < dinosaur
and lobster < llama < manatee.
