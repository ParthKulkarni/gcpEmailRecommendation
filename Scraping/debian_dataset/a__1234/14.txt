Have you tried $ debian-distro-info at all?
There are multiple bindings to it. there is csv file at
/usr/share/distro-info/debian.csv
And one can call it in many helpful ways:
$ debian-distro-info --testing
buster
$ debian-distro-info --series buster -r
10
Fix released by distro-info package? It lets you query things about
all the releases. There is ubuntu-distro-info to check all the Awesome
Animals too....
