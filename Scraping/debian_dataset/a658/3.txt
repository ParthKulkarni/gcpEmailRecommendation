Well, the gateway has no obligation to respond to pings, so it's not a
proper way.
Checking that the prefix matches however makes complete sense, and
should just work.  Provided that the network prefix length is correct,
of course, but it has to be otherwise it's a configuration error. I
guess the problem is rather there.
