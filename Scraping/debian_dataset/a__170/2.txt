We are talking about sub-*components* here not sub-*sections*.
Sections are only simple tags, they don't affect the archive structure
at all, except through the component, because the current Section
field conflates the component (main/contrib/non-free) and the section
(sound/kernel/etc).
I would either continue the conflation and go with:
Section: component/subcomponent/section
Section: non-free/firmware/sound
Or get rid of the conflation:
Section: section
Component: component/subcomponent
Section: sound
Component: non-free/firmware
Or for even more separation:
Component: component
Subcomponent: subcomponent
Section: section
Component: non-free
Subcomponent: firmware
Section: sound

Sure, but if we want them on ftp.debian.org (the main place we want to
use them) we need to modify or configure dak to generate them :)

FYI ftpmasters vetoed the proposal of using the syntax
non-free/firmware in the component. They also want to kill
jessie/updates and rename it to jessie-security.
