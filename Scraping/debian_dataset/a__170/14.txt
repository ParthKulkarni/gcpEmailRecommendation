It's a healthy discussion to be had, but we really should stop being scared by 
GRs. We had 3 in 2016 without much problems afterall.
Instead of assuming a consensus from a debian-devel discussion, I certainly 
see value in both the wordsmithing happening during the discussion, and in the 
relative weighing of various slightly nuanced versions that comes as output 
from the vote.
There's also value for the Debian project to be explicit when and if diverging 
from a longstanding tradition. We're discussing various different options 
here, and they don't all have the same symbolic weight:
* making the current "embeds distributable non-free firmware" ISO image more 
visible;
* splitting non-free in subsets;
* adding a non-free-firmware area;
* making the above ISO image the default image;
* etc.
To be honest, I don't think we are currently at a point in the discussion 
where we all feel the same consensus given the above (non-finite) set of 
options. Having an explicit vote will help better understanding where we stand 
as a project; also how we prioritise these.
tl:dr; don't be afraid of a GR, just do it calmly :-)
