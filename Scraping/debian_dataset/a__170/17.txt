Leaving aside whether the mechanism works at all, take a look at the

(For example, if he follows the directions, is he getting "loose

How does he figure out the difference? And what the heck is a kernel?) 
Anyway, try to read the following with your "new naive user" hat on:
debian-installer only prompts for firmware needed by kernel modules 
loaded during the installation. Not all drivers are included in 
debian-installer, in particular radeon is not, so this implies that the 
capabilities of some devices may be no different at the end of the 
installation from what they were at the beginning. Consequently, some of 
your hardware may not be being used to its full potential. If you 
suspect this is the case, or are just curious, it is not a bad idea to 
check the output of the dmesg command on the newly booted system and 
search for ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù. 
...
Any firmware loaded during the installation will be copied 
automatically to the installed system. In most cases this will ensure 
that the device that requires the firmware will also work correctly 
after the system is rebooted into the installed system. However, if the 
installed system runs a different kernel version from the installer 
there is a slight chance that the firmware cannot be loaded due to 
version skew.
If the firmware was loaded from a firmware package, debian-installer 
will also install this package for the installed system and will 
automatically add the non-free section of the package archive in APT's 
sources.list. This has the advantage that the firmware should be updated 
automatically if a new version becomes available.
If loading the firmware was skipped during the installation, the 
relevant device will probably not work with the installed system until 
the firmware (package) is installed manually.
If the firmware was loaded from loose firmware files, the firmware 
copied to the installed system will not be automatically updated unless 
the corresponding firmware package (if available) is installed after the 
installation is completed.
