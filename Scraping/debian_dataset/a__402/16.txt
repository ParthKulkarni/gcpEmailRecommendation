This seems like backward thinking to me.

I whole heartedly agree! One of the current challenges with replacing Alioth is
because of how many services it's providing. If Alioth were not being used for
guest accounts, this wouldn't even be a discussion.
Using Gitlab (or any VCS) as the user db for guest accounts means adding a
dependency that could block future upgrades... kinda like now. This is not a
future-proof design and will come at a future cost.
I'm happy to help implement an SSO solution that Gitlab is capable of using,
but I argue against using Gitlab as a future user database.
Side note... I got cert-based SSO working on https://gitea.debian.net/. It
actually ended up being pretty easy and kinda fun. I have a ticket with
upstream to support populating the email address, but that'll be a while.
Cheers,
