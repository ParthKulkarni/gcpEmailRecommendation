As expressed during the DC17 DSA and Cloud BoFs, I'm in favour of two
related but orthogonal things:
1 collapsing user management into a single user store (LDAP)**
2 introducing SAML or OIDC IdPs so that we can tie into AWS, Azure, and
  GCP SSO features
1 isn't necessarily a pre-requisite for 2 but the mishmash of processing
we have Guest vs DM vs DD is fugly (let alone Alioth-type users).
** Not necessarily the opinion of all DSA team members.
