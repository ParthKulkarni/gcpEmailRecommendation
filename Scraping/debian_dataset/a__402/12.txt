Hi all,
LLNG can have many backends simultaneously. The 2.0 version (not yet
published, in tests) adds a better plugin system that can be used to
create new backends. For now, LLNG is usable with:
* LDAP, Active-Directory, SQL, Kerberos (better with 2.0), Radius,
  another LLNG system (proxy or delegate), SSL (using webserver),
  Yubikey (better with 2.0), WebID,
* SAML-2.0, CAS, OpenID-2.0, OpenID-Connect,
* Multi   : backend chosed by rule (better with 2.0 => "Combination")
* Choice  : user can choose its backend
* backends usable by 2.0 only:
  * PAM
  * REST API
  * Second factor (U2F or custom)
It can also (and simultaneously) be used as identity provider for CAS,
OpenID-Connect, OpenID-2.0, SAML
It has been designed for French government but is used in many places
now. Our main installation handles hundreds applications for ~250000
users (~30 millions hits/day). I've heard about a bigger one in US but
have no info on it.
Best regards,
Xavier
