I've just pushed r70948, with the following patch:
  http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/d-i?view=revision&revision=70948
This is ugly, as a tag lookup would probably be the correct thing to do,
and that would avoid noise in the output, like this:
    - processing apt-setup (1:0.132)
    Cloning into 'apt-setup'...
    done.
    fatal: '1:0.132' is not a commit and a branch 'tag' cannot be created from it
    fatal: '0.132' is not a commit and a branch 'tag' cannot be created from it
    Switched to a new branch 'tag'
    
    - processing tzsetup (1:0.98)
    Cloning into 'tzsetup'...
    done.
    fatal: '1:0.98' is not a commit and a branch 'tag' cannot be created from it
    fatal: '0.98' is not a commit and a branch 'tag' cannot be created from it
    Switched to a new branch 'tag'
but at least that makes l10n stat computation work again.
