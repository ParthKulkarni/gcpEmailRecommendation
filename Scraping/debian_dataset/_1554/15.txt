This is the sort of thing I'd really prefer not to put into Policy.
Do we feel like we currently have a problem with maintainer judgement in
this area that warrants some intervention?  The original thread was just
an observation about a less-than-ideal naming convention, which is a
simple technical fix.  Figuring out what is and isn't offensive is much
more muddled, and if we don't have a problem, it might not be worth trying
to construct a solution to the harder problem.
