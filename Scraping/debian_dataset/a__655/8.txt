As I said, finish-install (which runs at the very last stage of d-i) has
this script:
| #! /bin/sh
| 
| # some things inside d-i will make an /etc/mtab file, but it shouldn't
| # be there in the installed system. Systemd will be desperately unhappy.
| if [ -f /target/etc/mtab ]; then
|     ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /target/etc/mtab
| fi
so until all d-i components are checked/modified not to rely on or toy
with /target's /etc/mtab, this code could be made to remove the
file/link entirely when the installation is finalized.

d-i only gets that file into place because some of its components need
it (or used to need it). It's technically easy to modify the code above
to drop /target/etc/mtab instead of converting from a static file to a
symlink.
That being said, changing this so late in the release cycle makes me a
bit uneasy. :/
