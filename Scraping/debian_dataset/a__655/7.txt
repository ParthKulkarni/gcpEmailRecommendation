I'm not exactly sure about the situation you describe, d-i does this
through a finish-install script (finish-install.d/70mtab):
| #! /bin/sh
| 
| # some things inside d-i will make an /etc/mtab file, but it shouldn't
| # be there in the installed system. Systemd will be desperately unhappy.
| if [ -f /target/etc/mtab ]; then
|     ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /target/etc/mtab
| fi
debootstrap itself does this:
| clear_mtab () {
|         if [ -f "$TARGET/etc/mtab" ] && [ ! -h "$TARGET/etc/mtab" ]; then
|                 rm -f "$TARGET/etc/mtab"
|         fi
| }
[ which matches its changelog entry ‚Üí ‚ÄúOn Linux, clear out /etc/mtab on
  exit if it's not a symlink.‚Äù ]
and there's no /proc/*mounts in debootstrap's code.
Back to the original bug report:
Just performed a stretch debootststrap from a jessie system (with 1.0.67
version), no /etc/mtab afterwards. Did the same with debootstrap upgraded
to 1.0.90, same story.
Both times, with this command:
  sudo debootstrap stretch /scratch/stretch http://localhost/debian
with /scratch being a tmpfs and localhost being my local, partial mirror.
Maximilian: If you're seeing a /etc/mtab inside a debootstrap'd
environment, you'll have to be more specific about the way you're
generating it.
