Right.
But the policy itself still makes a lot of sense (IMHO), and it can be
useful for more libraries other than OpenSSL.
Hopefully OpenSSL will re-license soon to Apache 2.0.
Then it may [1] be "only" incompatible with GPLv2-only software.
But in the worst case, it will be compatible with GPLv2+ and GPLv3.
