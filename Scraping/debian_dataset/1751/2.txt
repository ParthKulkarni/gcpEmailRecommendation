Yes, I believe so.
As a concrete example, the Netatalk project has for many years released 
code with plugins linking to OpenSSL, but has not added an exception.  
Authors of Netatalk try to make a living out of commercial support for 
their product, and I genuinely think it is in their interest to make it 
possible to use strong crypto - for personal use - but not allow 
redistribution of binaries with strong crypto.
