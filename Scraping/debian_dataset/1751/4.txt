Sorry, but people's intent is not sufficient.
Let's we decide that we're going to ignore a license, because the
author's a jolly nice person who obviously wasn't concentrating when
they chose the license.
We thus inflict this license violation on our users, our downstreams,
and their users.
Some of those users might then build their infrastructure upon that
software, meaning that changing it could be very costly, and those users
might be wealthy enough to be interesting to copyright trolls.
Then the copyright holder dies and their estate passes on to someone
that wants to maximise its value, so they sell the copyright to a
copyright troll, who then goes around threatening to sue for the GPL
violation, offering an explicit exception ... for a fee.
I think our users expect us not to put them in that situation.
What is the huge upside that makes it worth forcing our users to take
this risk without their explicit consent?
Cheers, Phil.
