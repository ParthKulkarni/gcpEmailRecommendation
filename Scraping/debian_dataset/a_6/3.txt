How is this supposed to work for DSAs?
Do you want to claim a security update is reproducible without checking,
or do you want to delay DSAs until the packages have been reproduced 
for all architectures?
Why should this be a per-package user-visible issue instead of aiming
at giving guarantess for all packages in main?
There is also a certain amount of WTF:
This would make a relatively hard to exploit issue appear more
worrisome to a user than installing a browser engine with zero
security support and more than 100 unfixed CVEs.
