signature.ascHi!
I'm closing this bug, since it was tagged "wontfix" for some
years, without answer. If you have new reasons to point out this
problem, please feel free to re-open it or ask me to do it.
You still can have the Installer behave in the way you wanted by doing
the install with a lower priority.
Thanks for reporting!
