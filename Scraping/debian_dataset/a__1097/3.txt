Package: grub-installer
Version: 1.136
Severity: serious
The grub installation step reproducibly fails using the latest stretch d-i
on both i386 and amd64 Xen PV guests. The logs indicate that grub-install is
looking for /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc instead of /usr/lib/grub/i386-xen, and
similarly on amd64.
I think the problem was introduced by
commit 66f75b7069aeba05eab776b5ac18dffa6874b5f3 .
Shouldn't amd64:grub-xen and i386:grub-xen read amd64/*:grub-xen and
i386/*:grub-xen, respectively, when matching against $ARCH:$grub_package ?
