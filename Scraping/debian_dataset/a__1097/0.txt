For the record: although I haven't used the image as-is, I have
(a) proofread the diff between 1.136 and 1.137, and
(b) successfully tested the same change in the following manner:
    -- on encountering the error in "Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard
       disk", skipped to "Execute a shell";
    -- ran "nano /usr/bin/grub-install" and applied the fix;
    -- exited the shell and reran "Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard disk".
For an amd64 guest this results in a bootable system. For an i386 one I run
into #799840, but as far as the present bug is concerned this counts as a
success.
