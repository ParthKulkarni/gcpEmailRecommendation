If you're so inclined, here's an image with grub-installer 1.137,
including the change you've suggested:
  https://mraw.org/~kibi/debian-stretch-rc2+xen.iso (~ 300 MB)
sha1sum: 61cca963a5d3bf3cbb33d802b2e337be0f16f643
[Note: This image will be removed from my server once the bug has been
addressed.]
BTW, I think the issue might have been triggered by having the following
line as the first entry of the ‚Äúcase‚Äù statement:
    *:grub|*:grub-pc|*:grub-efi*|sparc:grub-ieee1275|ppc64el/*:grub-ieee1275)
One might not realize the first part is an ‚Äúfull‚Äù architecture,
following the arch/subarch formatn.
Speaking of which, the ‚Äúsparc:grub-ieee1275‚Äù part probably doesn't work‚Ä¶
