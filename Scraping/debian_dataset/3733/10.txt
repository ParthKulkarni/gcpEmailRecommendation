You seem to be suggesting that the Policy Editors ensure that for every
change of Policy there is either a new Lintian tag or an MBF?
If that's what you mean, then it's completely false, and if we did
require ourselves to do that, there would never be any releases of
Policy :)
(it is, though, true that we check what packages are impacted and what
should be done about them)

I don't understand what role there could be for the upgrading checklist
if every change has an accompanying Lintian tag or MBF.  Perhaps you
could rephrase this remark about NMUs.
