Package: installation-reports
Followup-For: Bug #834974
Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***
   * What led up to the situation?
I was attempting a test installation of the new Stretch release.
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or ineffective)?
Followed instructions from 
      https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/armhf/ch05s01.html.en
using SDcard image made from from
      http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-armhf/current/images/hd-media/SD-card-images/firmware.MX6_Cubox-i.img.gz

and
      http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-armhf/current/images/hd-media/SD-card-images/partition.img.gz
        2017-06-15 08:34 19M
and the debian-9.0.0-armhf-DVD-1.iso installer image available on a USB stick formatted as ext2 to save network bandwidth.
   * What was the outcome of this action?
Installer ran as expected.  I installed to the SDcard all-in-one partition with separate /boot.
But when it got to the end and wanted to reboot, after I answered "yes" it just hung.
It appears that u-boot is not getting written to the front of the SDcard.  There is a large area of zeros where I would expect
to see boot binaries.
A second observation is that the installer was unable to dhcp the IPv4 address for the device.
I had to manually configure the network.
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
I expected to see it be able to complete dhcp and get its network configuration automatically.
I also expected it to boot into the installed system.
