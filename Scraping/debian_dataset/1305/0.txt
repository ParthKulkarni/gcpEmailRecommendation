We have sponsored maintainers, who theoretically could get by entirely
without an OpenPGP key. I don't know if any exist but I don't think
they should be blocked from -done. Also, many other contributors don't
have access to their OpenPGP key at all times and they shouldn't be
blocked from -done.
The solution is simply a lower bus factor in all Debian services,
including the BTS and more maintenance of the BTS spam filtering
rules.
