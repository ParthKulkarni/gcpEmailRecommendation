Ping?
@Kartik: could you give me a quick note, if you are interested in this?
There is no urgency now of course, we are far from Buster release, but
if you say "no interrest, sorry" or the like, I would try to find new
translators for Gujarati.
If you know of someone, who could take over the job, feel free to forward
this mail.
HINT:	For Gujarati there is now the possibility to translate via Weblate
	webinterface. Maybe you know someone interrested in this?
	Look at https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-installer/
Thanks
Holger
