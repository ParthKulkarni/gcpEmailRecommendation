From a technical point of view there is no need for codenames at all.
But being human I prefer names over numbers, even if it's just for
aesthetic reason - "buster" is just more comfortable than "debian10".
However, above all is the rule "do not confuse". Starting two
consecutive releases with the same letter does. Adding a third one makes
it worse.
