oh wow! it never occurred to me to do this for *all* Debian packages
automatically. of course such a thing would need to be enabled by the
maintainers explicitly for each package.
and as others have said: the packaging part should be automated, not
the uploading part. (which means, there should be maintainer review
inbetween.)
