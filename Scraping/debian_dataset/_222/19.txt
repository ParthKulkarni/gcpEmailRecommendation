My understanding of the current status is that Fedora package
maintainers can opt into a service that files a bug when a new
upstream version is detected (using the cross-distro
https://release-monitoring.org service).
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490150 for an example.
The service attaches a patch to the bug with the minimal packaging
changes required to build the new version (the equivalent of adding
the new version number to debian/changelog). (Comment 1 on the bug).
A test build was automatically done so the maintainer can review the
build log and install the binary packages (Comment 2).
The maintainer can then manually do the actual upload (Comment 3). In
this case, this happened less than 2 hours after the bug was opened.
Even if the test build fails, it still files the bug. See
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1459715 (I believe the failure was because
upstream switched to meson and python3).
