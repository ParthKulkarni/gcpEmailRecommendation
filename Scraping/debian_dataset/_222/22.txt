I was impressed by the work that Guido has described (see
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/11/msg00154.html).
He would certainly be one of the first individuals I feel like contacting
about something from where to grow.
My request was less about the technicality and more about learning
to what degree what kind of uploads would find general or partial
acceptance in our community.
But you are right, an external service is a safe bet as a first start that
we do not need to vote about - nor would I need to ask ;) However,
any such automation is something, if brought closer to Debian, that
has the potential to change us quite a bit. I felt that more than one
individual should be involved and at least should I myself be the
one to set it up, I would want (most of) you (all) to want it.
Best,
Steffen
