You can have aliases, like there exists one in form of syslog.service.
For such aliases you just define normal After/Wants/Requires entries.
However I really would start one step before.  What exactly do you think
a service dependency on "mail-transport-agent" does provide you?
The virtual package "mail-transport-agent" provides you with
/usr/sbin/sendmail to send mails.  However to use this interface you
don't need a service running (and several implementations of this
interface don't have any service apart from cron).

Bastian
