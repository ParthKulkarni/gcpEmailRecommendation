Did you get a chance to work on it?
I think it has to be an extension of backports with dependencies that
fall within the backports criteria being maintained in backports and
only packages that cannot be in backports maintained in volatile.
Original definition of volatile from https://www.debian.org/volatile/:
"Some packages aim at fast moving targets, such as spam filtering and
virus scanning, and even when using updated data patterns, they do not
really work for the full time of a stable release. The main goal of
volatile is allowing system administrators to update their systems in a
nice, consistent way, without getting the drawbacks of using unstable,
even without getting the drawbacks for the selected packages. So
debian-volatile will only contain changes to stable programs that are
necessary to keep them functional."
Proposed definition:
"Some packages aim at fast moving targets, such as complex web based
software with very small release cycles and new dependencies, they do
not receive security support or bug fixes for the full time of a stable
release. This means backporting targeted fixes are impossible.  The main
goal of volatile is allowing system administrators to update their
systems in a nice, consistent way, without getting the drawbacks of
using unstable, even without getting the drawbacks for the selected
packages. New dependencies introduced can be maintained in backports
repository. So debian-volatile will be an extension of debian-backports,
with dependencies that fall within the criteria maintained in
debian-backports."
