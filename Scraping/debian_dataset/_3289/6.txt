TTBOK that's not possible, and nothign is wrong in this regard with the
last keyring push.
Once a DM becomes a DD, their key is moved off the debian-maintainers
keyring and inserted into the debian-keyring keyring.  At that point dak
forgets all about that DM and so it doesn't allow to change it anymore;
but it retains the status of the allowed packages.
ftpmasters clean up the list of every so often; I know it my case it
stayed there for nearly a year after I became DD nearly 3 years ago.

OOI, what's the reason for this?  I can't understand what's troubling
you (personally, I was bothered by the green 'DM' labes on DDPO, but
nothing major as you can imagine…)
