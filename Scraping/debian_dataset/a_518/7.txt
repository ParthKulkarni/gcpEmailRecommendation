The last Atom-based netbooks with a BIOS supporting only 32-bit were 
actually sold ~ 2012/2013.
And with a peak of 12 million units sold in a quarter Atom netbooks
were at some point mainstream.
No disagreement from me that anything other than amd64 in unusual and 
should be non-default, just pointing out that new i386-only hardware was 
still being sold and popular nearly a decade after 2004.
