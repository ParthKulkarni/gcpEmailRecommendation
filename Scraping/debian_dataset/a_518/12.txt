Sounds quite sensible. You magically win quite a bit of capacity as
you don't have to include packages for two architectures.

I'll chime in to what others have said. I think DVD images should not
be the default/main download venue. Even though the careful package
ordering by (alleged?) popularity, I am sure a great deal of Debian
installs use under half of the packages provided by the first DVD (and
many that are not there, of course). A completely offline user will
have to juggle no matter if they got the DVD, and a connected user (no
matter their available bandwidth) will spend more time waiting for the
network if they choose to install from DVD.
