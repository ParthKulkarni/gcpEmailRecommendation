Your "This is not very smart" comment made me react fairly negatively at
first reading.  It's easy to assume bad things about the old version's
stability reading that, although that's presumably not what you were
saying.
Having looked into it a little, I found this:
  https://github.com/nodejs/LTS
which shows that the current packaged v4 packages will drop out of LTS
in April, and out of maintenance a year later according to this:
  https://hackernoon.com/node-js-v6-transitions-to-lts-be7f18c17159
Version 6, which J√©r√©my is suggesting should be our stable release
version, has been in LTS mode since October, and will be in LTS mode
until Apr 2018, then maintenance (presumably until Apr 2019).
I suspect that in a couple of years time, that Node.js programmers will
not be that much more impressed with v6 than they will be with v4, since
both will be astonishingly ancient, but at least v6 buys us an extra
year of usefulness.
I suspect that it might be better for all concerned if we simply
encouraged people to use this via backports from the start, to avoid the
problem of fast-moving projects getting preserved in amber by Debian.
Cheers, Phil.
