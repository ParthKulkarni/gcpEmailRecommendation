I don't know about the proposed wheezy SLTS as I haven't committed to
participate in it, but I would expect the former.

The plan in CIP is to backport hardware support to the newest SLTS
branch only.  Old hardware can continue running kernels built from an
old branch but new hardware will only be supported on the new branch.
The cadence of SLTS kernel branches is not yet determined, but if 
CIP successfully aligns with Debian then they will presumably be
started at 2 or 4 year intervals.  This is likely to mean that no new
hardware support is added beyond the LTS period.
