It's an excellent start. But I guess for gdal, it could be worth trying to
ping both upstreams to find a solution that works fine without embedding.
Even for OpenCPN it's probably worth it not to maintaining this fork by
themselves.

I can't really help with this, being out of time for now. :(

Yes, and I guess it's probably designed that way willingly.
The whole question is to decide wether the risk an embedded copy is
acceptable or too high. Mind that in the end, the FTP team has the final say
regarding this matter.
To try to have an explicit strict rule is the best way to face issues that
could be avoided.

It's far easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.
