The problems was revealed when fakeroot was flaky (native
implementation). That fakeroot problem is now solved.

Yes, you are right. From what I remember most packages either succeed
or fail when tests are run when run under fakeroot for all
architectures. In my opinion tests should never be run under fakeroot
(i.e. in the binary target) except when requested specifically (cannot
be solved by a buildd?). The problem is the same as for tests requiring
internet connections, which are not allowed, right?
