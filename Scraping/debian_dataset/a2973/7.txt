I have submitted a hosting request for debian-installer translations at
hosted.weblate.org
For the beginning, I want to activate weblate service only for currently
not-maintained languages (as a method of recruiting new translators) and/or 
for such languages who's translator asks me to do so.
And also, the committing from Weblate back to our svn repository is also
planned to not being done automatically, but I will process it manually (at least 
for the first time).
So translators reading this: 
if you want to switch from editing pure po files to Weblate too, let me know.
The hosting request should be processed 'til the end of october or beginning 
of november.
We will see how it goes...
