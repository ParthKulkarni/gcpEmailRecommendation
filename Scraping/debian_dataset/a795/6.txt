This is interesting.
Do you hold the same position regarding newer versions of GCC (which
have changed the libgcc license to GPLv3+ (plus exceptions), which is
probably as GPLv2-compatible as the OpenSSL license)?
On some architectures, libgcc is required for full ‚Äúlong long‚Äù
support, so it's not really optional even for C.
