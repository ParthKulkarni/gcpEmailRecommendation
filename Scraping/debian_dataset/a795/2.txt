I think we can use the discussion in the thread to determine what we
want from the lawyers, should we eventually decide to consult them.
I think it is far more likely to have a constructive discussion with
counsel if we tell them from the start that we want to ship GPL
software as part of Debian which links against libraries such as
current libgcc (for GPLv2 software) and OpenSSL, asking for advice
what is needed to make this happen while minimizing risk for Debian
and downstreams.
I hope we can at least get consensus that this is still the goal we
are after.
