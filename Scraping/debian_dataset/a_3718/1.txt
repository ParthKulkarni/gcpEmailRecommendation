That is interesting.  I build using gbp/cowbuilder and so I set these
environment variables:
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="parallel=`nproc`" DH_VERBOSE=1
I was not previously aware of the distinction between -j and -J for
dpkg-buildpackage.  However, looking at the dpkg-buildpackage man page
there does not appear to be a DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS setting to trigger the
use of -J in place of -j.  At least, that is the case on stretch.  Is
there an easy way (preferrably via environment variables) to achieve
that?
