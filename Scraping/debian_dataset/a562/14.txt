Yes, this. libpam-elogind is very unlikely to be enough to satisfy
dbus-user-session's dependency, for instance, unless elogind has taken
an excursion into systemd-like service management while I wasn't looking.
Some packages depending on libpam-systemd want logind's D-Bus and
libsystemd APIs, which elogind can mostly or entirely provide; policykit-1
is likely to be one of these.
Other packages depending on libpam-systemd want systemd --user, which
elogind can't provide, and which I'm reasonably sure people who don't
like systemd wouldn't want anyway (if you have a reason not to want
systemd managing system services as pid 1, then the same reason probably
applies equally to your per-user services).
