This has been briefly discussed before: it's a quite bad idea to have
provides with same name as a real package.  This works in Devuan where
there's no libpam-systemd, but in Debian we'd want something like:
    Depends: default-logind | logind
or, if a specific version is needed:
    Depends: default-logind (>= 3.14.15.926) | logind (>= 3.14.15.926)
(as suggested by smcv a while ago).
I even prepared a set of packages with that dependencies, although they're
badly outdated by now:
deb http://angband.pl/debian logind main
deb-src http://angband.pl/debian logind main
Key at:
https://angband.pl/debian/pool/main/k/kilobyte-archive-keyring/kilobyte-archive-keyring_3_all.deb
or:
wget -qO- https://angband.pl/deb/archive.html|apt-key add -
If you guys still think these deps are ok, tell me so and I'll refresh the
reverse dependencies in that repo.

Yeah.

It never worked for me, even when it was "maintained".  All -shim did was to
fulfill dependencies without actually bringing functionality such as suspend
/etc from the GUI.  For that you had to recompile the Utopia stack against
consolekit.  Elogind on the other hand does it ok.

Its packaging is tailored for Devuan where there's no systemd to deal with.
On the other hand they're doing necromancy with consolekit which seems to be
a waste of time to me.

I'm afraid this would be needed, per smcv's suggestion.

I have yet to test newer packages, apologies for not having done that yet.
Meow!
