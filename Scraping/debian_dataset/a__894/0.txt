Thanks for confirming.

That might come in handy if we have troubles reproducing your exact
issue. Out of curiosity: is grub able to handle unlocking the root
partition without a separate /boot partition? I haven't tried that
myself yet.

The os-prober codepath you're hitting is rather new (Stretch RC 1), so
I'm not surprised that you didn't hit this issue with Jessie.
