Unless I am missing something, yes you can access Alioth through ssh,
that's the way some of us create new git repositories:
$ ssh my-user@alioth.debian.org
Linux moszumanska 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.96-2 x86_64
Alioth.debian.org is a service run by the Debian project but it is
administered by a dedicated team: http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Alioth
For questions please check the FAQ first, then ask #alioth (on OFTC) or
admin@alioth.debian.org.
