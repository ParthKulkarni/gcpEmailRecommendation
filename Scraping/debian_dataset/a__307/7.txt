Meanwhile I changed the expired date of my key.
When I try to update it at keyring.debian.org with the command
$ gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --send-keys 0x3F9219A67F36C68B
I get the message
gpg: keyserver option 'ca-cert-file' is obsolete; please use 'hkp-cacert' in dirmngr.conf
gpg: keyserver option 'no-try-dns-srv' is unknown
gpg: sending key 0x3F9219A67F36C68B to hkp://keyring.debian.org
gpg: keyserver send failed: Operation not permitted
gpg: keyserver send failed: Operation not permitted
Was my attempt to late ?
Whatever, what should be the next step ?
Thanks again,
Jerome
