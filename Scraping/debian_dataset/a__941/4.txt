Dear Maintainer,
while automating Debian image creations thru netinst + KVM, I stumbled
upon a limitation from the emulated UARTs (if one sends back from the
guest to the host large logs, it might overrun the UART buffer which
complains with kernel messages about overused IRQ).
While turning to paravirtualized serial, I realized that the
char/virtio_console kernel module is missing in the netinst's initrd,
and this driver is required very early. Obviously I still use the UART
emulation for kernel messages since it's the only _very early_ output
medium, thus emulated UART and paravirtualized serials should be used
together.
If this module makes it to netinst's initrd, one would use those kvm
args:
-chardev file,path=virtiocon0.log,id=virtiocon0
-device virtio-serial
-device virtconsole,chardev=virtiocon0
... and in the guest a /dev/hvc0 would appear. Anything the guest would
write to /dev/hv0 would en up in the host's vitriocon0.log file.
