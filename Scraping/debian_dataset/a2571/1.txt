Dear Colin,
Thank you for pointing out the error of my ways. You are right. It
probably had to do more with the fact/bias that I came/used Debian
much later than I used various rpm distributions. I did see rpm
upgrade, downgrade was broken for a long time in a string of various
rpm-based distributions which later lead me to Ubuntu and then finally
to Debian.
Sorry for the noise.
