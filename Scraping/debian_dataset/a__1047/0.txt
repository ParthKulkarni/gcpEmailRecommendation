Hi Julian,
And thanks for the swift answer.

AFAICT the last -On wins, and it's been confirmed locally + on eller, so
I considered myself fine with it.

On second thought, I'm currently considering ignoring mips64el entirely
for the first alpha release. I've asked other release team members what
they think, so I might skip NMUing your package. I can test the noopt
addition on eller and rerun a debian-installer build so that you have
confirmation it builds fine with this change as well.
