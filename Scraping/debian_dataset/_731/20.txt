You're probably already aware of it, but just in case, please do not
forget 3.2.2:
    3.2.2
       The part of the version number after the epoch must not be reused
       for a version of the package with different contents, even after
       the version of the package previously using that part of the
       version number is no longer present in any archive suites.
    3.2.2
       For non-native packages, the upstream version must not be reused
       for different upstream source code, so that for each source package
       name and upstream version number there exists exactly one original
       source archive contents.
