Same here. When I introduced a package of the command-line utility
`weather` (in Etch) I named the source and binary packages
weather-util because there was a non-free game with the package name
"weather" in the archive three Debian releases earlier (removed
after Potato). I could have made the case for it, but packages names
are cheap and reusing a package name (no matter how old) is just a
recipe for headaches.
