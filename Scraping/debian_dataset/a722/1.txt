Sorry for the delay before getting back to you. I must admit I'm really
not familiar with the various use cases and setups at hand here, so I
can't really judge the proposed patches on their own merit.
If nobody (esp. Ben & Marco) objects to them, I guess you could push
them to master once alioth is back?
