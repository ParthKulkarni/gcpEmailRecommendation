thanks for the clarification, i didn't understand that distinction.  I'm
glad you're considering it at least for the point release.

fwiw, i'd heard privately earlier from the security team that they don't
see this fix as in their bailiwick, but they hadn't responded to my
requests for comments in public on the BTS.  So the deadlock
misperception may have been due to what looked like a longer delay from
my vantage point.
I'm glad it's not deadlock!
