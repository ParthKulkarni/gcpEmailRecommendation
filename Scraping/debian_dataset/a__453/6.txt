If there are issues, file bugs and mention them. So far your attitude is not
helpful at all.
Nobody said problems are going to magically go away by enabling apparmor. OTOH,
we won't know to what extent problems exists until it gets enabled everywhere.
It is one thing to enable something for your particular setup, and it's a very
different thing to have it enabled across all the distribution. So don't blame
the maintainers if it worked for them but doesn't work for you. Once we know
what specific problems exist, we can work on fixing those and/or we can revert
the situation, if that turns out to be the best option. In my experience, I have
only encountered one problem so far and it's already been worked on.
