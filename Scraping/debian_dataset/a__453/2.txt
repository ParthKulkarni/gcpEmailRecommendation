It's just a bad idea of a security model that implements ad-hoc
and mostly path based restrictions instead of an actually verified
security model.  Using that by default makes it much harder to actually
use a real MAC based security model, which not only is required for
various security sensitive deployments but also a good idea in general.
Last but not least apparmor had various issues where certain distros
shipped non-upstream features that later turned out to be incompatible
with what went upstream.
