I don't have any experience with writing or reviewing policy documents
and as the current maintainer of dbconfig-common am not sure if I have a
neutral mind on the current text. Therefore, I wasn't sure how to respond.
What I like to achieve is to have something in the policy. If the
current document is outdated, then let's update it and put it in policy.
The current document is the best we have now. How would be start a
review now that is likely to end up in policy? The review of 12 years
ago led to a stand-alone document that didn't receive much attention
later on.
