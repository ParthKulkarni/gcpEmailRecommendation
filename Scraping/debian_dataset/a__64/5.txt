gdal has had one security issue in the past and I wouldn't be
surprised if it had one in the future, since it is basically a
collection of file format parsers. As such I am not sure using a fork
of it is a good idea. It would be best to work with both upstreams to
resolve the delta.

Personally, I don't think it is ever acceptable.
