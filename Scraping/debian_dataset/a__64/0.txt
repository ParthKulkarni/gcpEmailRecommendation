It's not that I don't understand your reasoning. Still, if this is the
conclusion, it's kind of sad because it's means that a price-awarded [1]
application won't be packaged in Debian. Upstream is very clear on this.
OTOH, it will be available as a flatpak package (sandboxed, FWIW) which
should satisfy most users. But the embedded communities would really
need a pure Debian package.
I also note that this was the position in Fedora (some years ago I
actually felt that Debian was more flexible then Fedora on this). Fedora
today basically allows bundling. Fedora is not Debian, though.
Cheers!
