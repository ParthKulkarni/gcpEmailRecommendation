I'd say yes, but that would be a _different bug, and depends on how that 
metapackage is intended to behave.
For each _direct_ package relation, question is if related packages a 
needed for _all_ uses of the package (depend), there is a rare use 
without it (recommend) or it is only uncommonly needed (suggest).
If it _never_ makes sense to install xfce4 metapackage without also 
installing xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin (i.e. if xfwm4 crashes without that 
plugin existing), then it makes sense to declare strict as a dependency.
Argument above by Michael is that it sounds like it _never_ makes sense 
to install xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin without also installing pulseaudio.
Example: If xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin can somehow communicate (by itself, 
without help from pulseaudio package!) with a remote pulseaudio install 
on a separate host, then it makes sense for the package relation to be a 
recommendation.  If you cannot describe a single use case for this 
package without its related package, then depend on that other package 
(no matter needs of _reverse_ related packages further up the stack!).
