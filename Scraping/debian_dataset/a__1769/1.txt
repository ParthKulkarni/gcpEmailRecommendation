One other important point for the Ubuntu infrastructure is that the
autopkgtests are a ratchet.  IOW, if a test has *never* passed, its continued
failure won't block promotion.  It's only once a test starts passing and then
regresses will it block.
We have an "excuses" page that shows you what things look like.  It could be
prettied-up, but it provides lots of useful information.  It also includes a
retry button (the little three-arrow triangle) for people with the proper
permissions.
