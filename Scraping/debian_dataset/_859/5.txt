I don't appreciate the selective quoting. Here's what I actually said in

See that thing there? That's a link. To documentation. It tells you how
to do the thing you want, which has been implemented since 8.something,
I believe. Yes, the Debian wiki *could* tell you how to do that, and I
may do so tomorrow if nobody beats me to it, but at the end of the day
you're a developer who's supposed to be able to find relevant
documentation. It's not like GitLab is an obscure piece of software that
nobody else has ever tried using. Show some initiative.
