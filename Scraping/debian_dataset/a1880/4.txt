For some reason I can't upload to this host (or the old one) from my
network without disabling IPv6 first (by overriding the IP address in
/etc/hosts). Otherwise I get timeout errors from dput-ng.
ping/traceroute works, both over IPv4 and IPv6. Manually connecting to
the port seems to work fine too.
Any ideas?
