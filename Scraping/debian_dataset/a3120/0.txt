Whatever. Your theory of what happened has a problem, though. I've
installed debian many, many times. I've always used the menu to select
the disk, never entered it manually.
I'd have a better case if I repeated the whole process and produced the
same results. But I'm just a user and I don't want to spend a lot of
time doing this, because after doing the install I'd have to restore the
subsequent configuration work I did. Sorry, perhaps someone else will
test this particular corner of the installation ... -- al
