Did writing to both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb work or report a failure at this
point? Also, when you say installer interface, you mean answering the
grub-installer prompt during the installation process, rather than switching
to a console and typing commands there, right?

Please provide installation logs (/var/log/installer has them), esp. syslog,
as we would expect from installation reports (see [1] for more info).

I haven't tried LVM-on-RAID1 without separate /boot yet, so I'm not sure
it's expected to work directly; but I know for sure that LVM-on-RAID1 with
separate /boot should work just fine.
