Well, the first entry in the menu (‚ÄúEnter device manually‚Äù) makes it
possible to specify paths manually, and separating them with a space
makes it possible to specify several of them at once.
I haven't played with going back and forth to iterate with different
settings like what you've mentioned, but given the syslog you attached,
it looks like there was no run with /dev/sda, which explains your system
didn't boot.
