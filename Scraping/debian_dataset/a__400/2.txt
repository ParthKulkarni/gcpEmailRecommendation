Hi,
There are two d-i related items in the release checklist that we need
input from the d-i team[1]
Items are:
 * Installation Guide should be up-to-date
 * release-notes: d-i team signoff for specials with this update (check
   esp. if old versions of d-i should be purged if new versions enter
   $suite's d-i area)
Can someone help me with whether these two items are done and if not,
what is missing?
Thanks,
~Niels
