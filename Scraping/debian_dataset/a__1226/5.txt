I'm afraid I disagree.  I think it is not reasonable to expect a
maintainer to always double-check for the latest policy updates on
every upload.  Even for packages I care a lot about I check for policy
updates on each package only once or twice per Debian release.

I think a maintainer can safely rely on the rest of the Debian project
not declaring your package buggy enough that you definitely need to do
something about it right now.  Unless one hears to the contrary some
other way, of course.
