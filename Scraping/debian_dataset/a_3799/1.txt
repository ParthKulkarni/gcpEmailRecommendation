Well, I think several arguments have been brought up in this thread already.
Can you briefly explain how you will manage to ensure that your pacakge
does not violate a (new) Policy? That you still know in x years which version
you've used? Will you then check the complete package again? Is this less work
than maintaining a simple field?
So from my perspective I *want* this field because it helps me to understand
where I left the last time.
But there are others too: How's about when you orphan your package? Or some
other team mate jumps in? NMUs? QA-team?
Maintaining the S-V out of source might sound as a solution, but IMHO it isn't:
d/control is much more "present" (available) than some other website,
database...  etc...  And information seems to lose sync when not maintained
closely together.  Yes, I don't think that this would save time, contraire. One
will still need to check if changes in policy applies to the package and
suddently one would need to check two places and wonder if someone forgot to
push an update...

In the light of this discussion, I fear we should make S-V mandatory; IMHO this
is a minor thing to maintain but with a much higher cost in not having it.

If the end user would be the only consumer of the package...  The end user
usually only used the binary package, so in this logic we should stop
provoiding source pacakges and just ship binaries compiled on the maintainer
machine? After all, they can get the source upstream!
Of course this a gross hyperbolic, but I see a bit of a tedency in the latest
threads with the same overall topic to simplify a maintainers life (which is a
good thing). But usually in those topic only consider only one stakeholder
(mostly the maintainers side) and completly ignore other uses of such a
information...  If we make things easier, I guess, we should concentrate to
find a way which makes it less effort in a sum and not me a bit sad because I
think of Debian being a collaborative thing and not a personal optimization
problem.
