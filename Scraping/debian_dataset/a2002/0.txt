Currently I'm writing a script for that.
I call debootstrap without and with the patch and diff the logs and do
a complete diff -r on the resulting directories. Which combinations of
option should also be tested? Currently I have only a small list:
check stretch
check buster
check --variant=minbase stretch
check --variant=minbase buster
check --variant=buildd stretch
check --arch i386 --variant=buildd stretch
check --arch i386 stretch
Please suggest more test I should do. Doing qemu-deboostrap should
also work.
