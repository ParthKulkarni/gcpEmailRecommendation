I can even come up with two:
First, it sounds like a layering violation, forcing programs to know 
about implementation details several layers of dependencies away.
As an example, look at the "libdbus-1-3 -> dbus" Recommends.
When libdbus-1-3 itself is used by a library, I don't see any reasonable
way to push the implementation detail that dbus is used all the way up
to all applications.
Second, what should this achieve?
The mentioned usbmuxd is 0.1 MB.
libglib2.0-0 recommends libglib2.0-data.
The sole contents of libglib2.0-data are 9.5 MB translations.
This recommends would still be permitted, and by default these
translations should be installed.
In the common case disk space is plenty and not a problem.
Except for some cases of daemons, installing too much is
therefore usually not a problem.[1]
Recommends are basically dependencies you are allowed to break when
you know what you are doing, and that's the level of expertise someone 
is expected to have when optimizing disk space usage.
