+1. This was a *very* clear message, in that respect, although I
certainly agree that it wasn't necessary to phrase it quite in that way.
A single sentence saying "message received", if at all, would have been
more than enough; the OP clearly wasn't interested in *why* Debian was
contacting him again after fourteen years, and any explanation to that
effect would only be a nuisance to him, anyway.
