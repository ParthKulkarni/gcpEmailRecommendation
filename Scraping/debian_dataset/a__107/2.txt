Hi,

Probably because even at that time there were procedures that weren't
followed, and apparently nobody after then bothered to check your status
*and* follow up appropiately to clean it up.

I don't know what happened back then to your forwarding address (for
however strange your statement looks to me), so I can't quite comment
here.

I can say that the MIA team didn't try to get you recently.  That was
Jonathan McDowell that apparently was in contact with you and -according
to the note he left- started on 2018-08-25 the processÂ¹ to have you
properly retire. Missing the required follow up from your sideÂ² I sent
a follow up on 2018-09-30 completely out of curtesy as from my side it
just seemed like you missed the mail but you were interested in cleaning
your position.

Today, more than two months after Jonathan started the process, I
proceed to follow the "remove" route instead of the "retire" route,
which triggers an email in debian-private@.

ACK, we will have DAM remove you instead of retire.  I suppose there is
no harm as you don't seem interested in the "benefits" that the
"retired" DDs have over the "removed" ones.
I'm sorry to have bothered you more than necessary.
Good bye, and thank you for your contributions you made back then!

Â² which would have consisted in following one link in that mail, and
  then click a single other button; really, nothing more
