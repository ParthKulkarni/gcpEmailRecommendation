I'm pretty sure that's actually _not_ what it's saying, or at least it's 
an overly literal interpretation.
For one, the container is a full debian OS container.  If apachectl 
wasn't there, apache would never _start_, much less fail to _restart_.
Second, when looking into the code, the "Failed at step NAMESPACE" is, I 
think, the crux of the issue.  It's failing at a step related to setting 
up the namespaces to run apachectl, not finding the binary.
Either way, apachectl is very definitely in the container.
