However, what will English mother tongue speakers do, if they read 
"bootloader" and don't know, what this is (like beginners)?
They will have to search on the web (Wikipedia ...).
So that's not a localization problem, it can not only happen in translations,
but also in English.
Means: writing the English terms when unsure about a translation of such
technical term should be mostly safe. 
You can always search the web on the English term.
But you cannot find something on the web for a newly introduced translation.
