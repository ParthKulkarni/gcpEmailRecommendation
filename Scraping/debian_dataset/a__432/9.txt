Ah, I didn't know that the compose sequences are used for the dead keys.
Compose sequences in console-setup are encoding-based.  See for example 
/etc/console-setup/compose.ISO-8859-2.inc.  However at present there is 
no file compose.UTF-8.inc and even if there is one ckbcomp will not use 
it.

This bug should be fixed in a future version of console-setup.  But for 
the time being I can suggest the following fix.  Run (as root)
cd /etc/console-setup/
ckbcomp cz >cz.kmap
Open the created file cz.kmap in a text editor and add the following two 
lines at the end:
compose '^' 'd' to U+010F
compose '^' 'D' to U+010E
Run (as root) in order to confirm that the new layout works as it should:
loadkeys cz.kmap
If it does, then add in the file /etc/default/keyboard the following line:
KMAP=/etc/console-setup/cz.kmap
Remove this line from /etc/default/keyboard when you receive a message 
that the bug has been fixed.
