Severity: important
When on the console, while switched to the czech keyboard layout,
the keyboard button used as the dead key for the caron (the one
marked with "+" next to the backspace on the international PC keyboard)
does not produce characters with the caron above the letter.
Prerequisite:
 toggle the keyboard from us to cz by once pressing CTRL and SHIFT together
Current behavior:
   when pressing SHIFT and + together, followed by pressing "d", produces:
        ^d
   when holding SHIFT, and pressing + followed by pressing "d", produces:
        ^D
Expected behavior:
   when pressing SHIFT and + together, followed by pressing "d", should produce
   a character with the UTF-8 code 0xC48F:
        ď
   when holding SHIFT, and pressing + followed by pressing "d", should produce
   a character with the UTF-8 code 0xC48E:
        Ď
The effect is the same for the "t", "n", "c" and any other character in the
czech alphabet that has the variant with the caron above the letter, capitals
including, and when one tries to write that character using the caron dead
key on the czech keyboard. So, for example, instead of:
     ť ň č Č
I get:
     ^t ^n ^c ^C
The above has been observed with the following setup:
$ cat /etc/debian_version

I have confirmed that the problem described exists for the "bksl", "qwerty" and
"qwerty_bksl" keyboard variants, as well as XKBVARIANT ""
(in the /etc/default/keyboard).
The problem described above appeared since the switch from the kbd
package to the keyboard-configuration/console-setup packages, and did not
exist in Debian < 9.
Please suggest a fix or a workaround. Thanks.
