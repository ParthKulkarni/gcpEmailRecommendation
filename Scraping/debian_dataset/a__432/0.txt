The original keyboard layouts of kbd are in the package console-data.  
Can you install this package and see if some of the Czech layouts works 
properly with UTF-8 encoding.  I have some doubts that the dead keys are 
usable with non-Latin1 symbols on the console.
You can try the various Czech layouts with one of the following six 
commands:
loadkeys cz-lat2.kmap.gz
loadkeys cz-us-qwerty.kmap.gz
loadkeys cz-lat2-prog.kmap.gz
loadkeys cz-us-qwertz.kmap.gz
loadkeys sunt5-cz-us.kmap.gz
loadkeys sunt5-us-cz.kmap.gz
