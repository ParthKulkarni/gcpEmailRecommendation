Instead of the command
   ckbcomp cz >cz.kmap
which I suggested in my previous message, you can use something like
   ckbcomp cz dvorak-ucw grp:win_menu_switch lv3:menu_switch >cz.kmap
See `ckbcomp -help` or `man ckbcomp`.

Thanks, this will be useful.

When I have time I will upload a fixed package to Unstable.
I am not sure, but I think only important bugs are fixed in the stable 
releases of Debian.  Unless there is some change in the policies of 
Debian of which I am not aware (which is not impossible, to be 
honest...).
