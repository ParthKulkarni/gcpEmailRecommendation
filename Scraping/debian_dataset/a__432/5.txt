Hello guys,
Thanks for your valuable input, and for shedding more light on the inners
of the current localisation approach.
The layouts from the 'kbd' package do not work with UTF-8 input. I've
used them in the past with 1-byte input forced in the kernel by adding
the 'vt.default_utf8=0' boot parameter..
Anton, thanks for suggesting the workaround. However, adding the kmap 
"snapped" with ckbcomp and hand-modified afterwards as a value to 'KMAP=' 
in the /etc/default/keyboard is not really a workaround, since
this overrides whatever that the user may have set in the XKBOPTIONS (such 
as grp switching/toggling), effectively leaving her/him with only the 
localised KMAP loaded. Nevertheless, the hand-modification you've 
suggested for me was the missing key in the puzzle - please see further.
set of all the missing compose defs for the czech letters. 
Please see the attached file. If you could append this to the 
/etc/console-setup/compose.ISO-8859-2.inc file. This will add all the 
missing definitions, enabling the user to input all the czech letters on 
a cz keyboard layout, provided that (s)he has defined either 'Lat2' or 
'ISO-8859-2' for the 'CODESET=' in the /etc/default/console-setup .
