Dear Andreas,
Quoting Andreas Jakowidis <ajakow@emailn.de>:
Debian has a long history on mobile devices, going back to the Nokia N770¹
and the OpenMoko². For current developments, please check the Debian mobile
wiki page³, mailing list⁴ and IRC channel⁵.
Recent mobile devices running Debian or similar are the e.g. GPD Pocket⁶,
the Purism Librem 5⁷ (maybe available next year), or the Pyra Handheld⁸
(maybe available this year).
There are also developers trying to run Debian on different Android devices,
with different levels of success. Very often, it is not possible to update
the kernel, because drivers are not upstreamed or even non-free.
Cheers, Martin
