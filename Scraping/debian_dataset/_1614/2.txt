Hi,
that is fine in general. Since Python 2 is supported in Buster, please
use severity: normal for now. Most of these games are considered to be
complete and/or no longer supported upstream. If we want to preserve as
many of those games as possible, we should come up with a plan how we
can port python-pygame games to python3-pygame.
Regards,
Markus
