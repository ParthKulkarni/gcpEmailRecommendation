It doesn't, the last time it changed was on 2.4->2.6.
OTOH, *driver probe* ordering can and does change, especially when
device probes are being done in parallel.  It is best to not get bus
enumeration (and even device endpoint enumeration) confused with device
*registration* by kernel drivers.

Most buses are stable as far as enumeration goes: we don't have HBAs and
endpoints being renumbered across boots at all for PCI and PCIe and even
USB.
But bus device enumeration is separate from device register ordering.

Indeed.  Unless you add modules for which you care about the load order
to /etc/modules.  Those are staticaly loaded first (obeying dependencies
by depmod, though) even by the initramfs.  It has been supported for a
decade or more.
That *still* won't help for some drivers, where parallel *device* probes
are done AND device answer speed mandates which one will register first.
This does *not* apply to PCI/PCIe NICs handled by the same kernel
driver, but it very likely applies to USB for example.

Unfortunately, this is incorrect.
MOST PCI/PCIe NICs indeed use "ethX", etc.  But the naming scheme really
is device driver-specific, and the "default" name used by a driver is
considered part of the kernel stable ABI, and cannot be changed on the
kernel side unless it is done opt-in at kernel config time (kconfig) or
at boot time (kernel command line, device tree, etc).
That said, most consumer devices nowadays are handled by drivers that
will use either ethX or wlanX by default.

Correct, in the general case.
