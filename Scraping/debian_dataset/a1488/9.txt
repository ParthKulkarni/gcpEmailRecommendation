Yup.

Yup. In fact, at this point I declare the conversion to be as done as
it's going to be. I've just imported these test repos into the
installer-team area:
 https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/d-i
 https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/di-i-manual
 https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/di-i-archive
I've got a local backup of the svn repos still, and I'll keep them for
a while so if we find I've screwed up we can still recover. I'll keep
these for a couple of months.
I've just added the one commit that's happened in the last week
(r71079 from Holger), and all seems good. I'm just about to add my
changes for .mrconfig etc. now.
AFAICS we still need to (in rough order):
 1. Disable svn commits
 2. Tweak the translation workflow to push changes to
     d-i.git/packages/po, instead of d-i in svn.
 3. Change the checkouts of d-i on the buildds etc. to use git?
 
 4. Update docs to point to the new repos
Anything else?
