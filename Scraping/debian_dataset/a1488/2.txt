Hey,
Looking at namesâ€¦

I guess this is fair, even if people might confuse that with the
(real) debian-installer package/repository.

This seems to be named this way, now?
  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/d-i-manual
Can't we just go for that instead, which would have the benefit of
matching the source package name?
  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/installation-guide
>  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/di-i-archive
Apparently named https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/d-i-archive
now, which looks fine if we keep the d-i name for the old svn top-level
(see first point).
Cheers,
