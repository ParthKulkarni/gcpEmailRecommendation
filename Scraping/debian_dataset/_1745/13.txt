As a (lapsed) porter for x32 here in Debian, I don't think it's worth
keeping.  Despite all the touted benefits, no one uses the arch.  There's a
big difference between popcon 8 for an arch requiring obscure hardware or
a FPGA, vs popcon that low for hardware everyone of us owns.  Unlike
kfreebsd-[x86] you can even conveniently run x32 in a chroot or lxc, yet no
one does.
The advertised benefits of the port are:
* memory savings
* a few percent speed gain over amd64
With primary use cases being hosting of multiple containers, and/or running
a large number-crunching cluster.  Sacrificing lots of human hassle for a 7%
speed boost makes you a "Gentoo ricer"[1] on a desktop/laptop, but could be
a nice thing on a $1M cluster.
But, recently someone approached me with exactly that use case.  He also
required jessie, which happens to be the only release I have a consistent
set of packages for.  The evaluation result was: nope.
A short while ago Linus pondered dropping x32, as it complicates kernel
syscall code.  The only proof he was told that "it's still in use" was my
https://debian-x32.org -- yet that site hasn't been updated since jessie.
Thus: I propose to drop x32, and reallocate your tuits to other archs.
Meow!
