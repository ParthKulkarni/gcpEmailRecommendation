It can be up to 50% which is why Intel's own C/C++ compiler actually provides
an option to automatically generate x86_64 code with 32-bit pointers:

I was actually on this discussion and I provided Linus with an up-to-date
x32 chroot to test the changes which apparently worked.

Thanks, but x32 doesn't really use any resources and as long as the stuff
works, I don't see a reason to keep people from using it. If Linux upstream
decides to ax it, we will ax it here as well. Until then, it allows doing
some extra CI for package builds and edge cases.
And as long people invest resources in ports like Hurd and kFreeBSD, x32
is the lesser burden to be worried about.
