Hi Chris,
Well your symlink in /bin was dated 2018-11-26 17:23. If that sounds
like the sort of time you attempted a usrmerge (and it failed) then I'd
say the fingers point towards that indeed.
Your purge/reinstall could well fix it, just double-check you haven't
ended up with *both* /bin/busybox and /usr/bin/busybox. You should have
only the former and should be able to safely remove /usr/bin/busybox,
assuming /bin/busybox is not a symlink anymore.
Best regards,
Chris
