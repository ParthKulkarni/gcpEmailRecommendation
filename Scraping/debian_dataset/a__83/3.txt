After the aforementioned purge-and-reinstall I rebooted and everything
appears to be fine. :)

Whilst you could indeed change this, given that my attempt at usrmerge
failed for reasons unrelated to busybox and/or initramfs generation
(#914716 in molly-guard) the problem â€” if there was one to begin
with! â€” is not here and is likely to just mask the underlying problem
anyway.
Thus, we should probably just close this bug.
Regards,
