One thing with compat 10 that doesn't make a lot of sense to me is how
dh_missing is enabled by default but a no-op. It'd make more sense to me to
change that in compat 11 to be enabled by default and run with --list-missing
(--fail-missing is probably too much at this point), or make it run with --list
or --fail-missing, but not enabled by default, and make it an addon. So that one
can have:
No dh_missing:
%:
	dh $@
Or for dh_missing:
%:
	dh --with missing $@
I think one of those two options would make more sense than the status quo, and
I probably lean towards the first option (enabled by default with --list-missing).
Thoughts? Let me know if you want a bug report about this.
Cheers,
Emilio
