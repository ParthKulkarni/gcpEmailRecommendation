Hello,
systemd is a replacement for the standard init command, which normally 
runs as process id 1 on initialisation of a UNIX bootup. There has been 
a movement, especially around the Red Hat-related developers to copy 
Microsoft Windows and all of its features. Now this interpretation of 
how a userspace should look like is implemented and was introduced with 
big criticism and change in the Open Source world into many 
distributions. The debacle in Debian is the best example in how to not 
introduce such a changing technology into a distribution.
I won't repeat the same thing said on many places because now we are 
living with the reality of systemD all around us in corporate 
environments where it was forced down on our throats without even a 
discussion. If Debian drops sysVinit support I will drop Debian and make 
sure to push BSD integration at my workplaces too. Matter of fact I 
already started migrating apps from the old Debian 7 (last good shitD 
free debian distro) to FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD alternatives.
Dropping sysvinit would also put an enormous amount of work on the 
Devuan project (the only future for Debian) by making them fork more 
packages.
This is your last chance to do the right thing and announce the removal 
of this fucking piece of shit malware(D) from Debian and go back to 
sysVinit or openrc!
