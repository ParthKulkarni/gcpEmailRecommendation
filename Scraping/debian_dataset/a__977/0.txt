Hi Holger,

Thanks for taking a look at this but you have misunderstood the bug
report. www-browser was satisfied at the time, by w3m, which does not
provide x-www-browser (and there's no assertion anywhere that Provides:
www-browser means ships an alternative for x-www-browser)
The problem is there doesn't seem to be something like "x-www-browser"
virtual package name corresponding to the alternatives name. Chromium,
firefox, firefox-esr and epiphany provide "gnome-www-browser" which is
close, but obviously excludes (e.g.) konqueror, which merely provides
"info-browser, man-browser, www-browser".
The proper fix here, distribution wide, is to rationalise the virtual
package names for GUI browser packages. (A starting point might be to
post about the issue to -desktop, and I might do that.)
But for LXDE, the issue would also not occur if taskbar icons
configured to point at not-existent .desktop URIs were not drawn or
de-configured on session start-up.
