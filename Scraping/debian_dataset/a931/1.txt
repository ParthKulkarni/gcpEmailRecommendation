If there are multiple bootable operating systems on local hard drives,
I think the installer sets Debian to be higher priority than the other
operating systems.
But as far as I am aware, the relative priority of boot entries on
removable vs hard drives is solely controlled by the BIOS/UEFI
firmware.
