You've been bitten by an unexpected change due to your PC's vendor
doing crap setup, I'm afraid. For your setup to have worked, that
means that you had a Windows setup using BIOS boot, but the BIOS set
to boot UEFI first then BIOS second. If you want sensible dual boot
with a BIOS-booting Windows, the best way to achieve that is to turn
UEFI boot *off* in the BIOS setup so you have consistency between the
two OSes. The installer even has code to check for this setup and
offer you a chance to *not* install in UEFI mode if it detects traces
of BIOS-booting OSes on your system.

  Getting a SCSI chain working is perfectly simple if you remember that there
  must be exactly three terminations: one on one end of the cable, one on the
  far end, and the goat, terminated over the SCSI chain with a silver-handled
  knife whilst burning *black* candles. --- Anthony DeBoer
