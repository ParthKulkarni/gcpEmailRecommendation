Definitively, we need more maintainers, but it's not happening.

If the team stays inactive, for sure, I will ask for removal.

Yes, you've done some work, and many thanks for it, it has been very

this point in the OpenStack dev cycle, normally it should have been
fully uploaded *AND* tested against tempest.
