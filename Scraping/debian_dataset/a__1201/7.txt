I'm happy to volunteer for this. TBH, my goal would be to minimize the
delta on these packages to Ubuntu's versions of the packages, so we can
maintain them collaboratively. But, there's certainly no need to drop
the packages from Debian.

These are more "nice to have" packages, not really critical. We can ask
around to see if anyone is using the packaged versions, but if not we
should just drop them from Debian.

Canonical doesn't have a large team for this work, but I imagine we can
handle it just fine between their team and a few volunteers.
