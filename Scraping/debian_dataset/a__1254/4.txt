It doesn't, though.

If you install with full disk encryption enabled, then by default the
installer will overwrite the whole encrypted volume.  This is done to
avoid leaking some information about the size and structure of the
encrypted data.
You can cancel this process, and the installation process will still
continue.  That should really be explained in the status message.
If you don't install with full disk encryption, no overwriting is done
by default.
