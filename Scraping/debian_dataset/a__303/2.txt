Forwarding this to translators of relevant languages:
Hi all,
I would like to get your attention on this bugreport for the debian-installer.
It looks to me, as if RTL writing direction is no longer correct in the 
text-based installer.
But as I am not a mother-tongue speaker of the affected languages, I would like
to have some opinion/acknoledgement from you regarding this.
The bugreport contains some screenshots, where you can see the text-based an
the graphical installer - side-by-side - for all those languages.
IMO the graphical installer looks good, while the text-based one - with the
blue background - is not correct.
Note: the screenshot were created with the buster-alpha4 netinst ISO image.
Many thanks
Holger

Subject: Bug#917909: [text-based installer] right-to-left writing direction broken
Package: debian-installer
Severity: important
While investigating an old bugreport regarding Hebrew, I found that RTL writing
direction is completely broken in the text-based installer
(writing direction seems left-to-right and text is aligned to the left).
That's also the case in Stretch, while it was ok in Jessie installer!
I will sent some screenshots to the bug later, to document it.
As we are near the freeze for Buster, it would probably be the best way to 
work around this, if we disable the RTL langugages completely in the text-based 
installer (since they are also supported there and it seems ok in the 
graphical installer) ?
This affects:	Arabic
		Hebrew
		Persian
		Uyghur
			
I will point relevant people to this bug, to get opinions from mother-tongue 
speakers | readers ...
Holger
