My reply was far too abrupt; sorry about that. I fully endorse this
idea. :)
I think what's missing to make this a reality is some sort of
newcomer-friendly aggregated view of such issues and â€” naturally â€” for
them to be kept up-to-date with enough details needed to implement
them.
Hm, there was an initiative a few years ago ("Gnome Love" IIRC?) - was
anyone part of that? It would be interesting to discover what they
learnt from it.
Best wishes,
