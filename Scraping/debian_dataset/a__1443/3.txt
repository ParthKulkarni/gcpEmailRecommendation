Hello,
I had the same issue.
Running a live-build image, nothing worked to setup the keyboard layout.
I found out that my image contained /etc/console-setup/cached_* files.
What really helped was adding a hook in live-build to remove those files, before the
image was built.
$ cat config/hooks/live/0900-cleanup.hook.chroot
#!/bin/sh
rm -f -- /etc/console-setup/cached_*
Cheers
