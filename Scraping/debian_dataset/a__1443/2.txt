Can you send the output of
ls --full-time /etc/console-setup/cached* /etc/default/console-setup /etc/default/keyboard
If the times of the cached files are more recent than the times of the 
configuration files, then console-setup won't look at the configuration 
files at all.
I don't know how live-config works but isn't the script 
components/0150-keyboard-configuration (I am looking at the source 
package of live-config) supposed to edit /etc/default/keyboard?  And if 
this is so, then how it is possible for the cached files to be more 
recent than /etc/default/keyboard?
