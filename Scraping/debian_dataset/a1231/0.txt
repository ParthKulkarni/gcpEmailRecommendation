I'm a bit confused: wasn't it already specified pretty precisely?
I would be in favor of adding the target back, with a description
along the lines of "If you provide a get-orig-source target, it should
satisfy <this interface>.  If you provide neither a get-orig-source
target nor a debian/watch file and you do not use an archive from
upstream as-is, please include clear instructions in README.source to
allow a human to produce an upstream tarball."
Context: I have run into a few packages that used the +dfsg convention
without documenting what they removed from the tarball and I was not
able to locally update them. :(
Thanks,
Jonathan
