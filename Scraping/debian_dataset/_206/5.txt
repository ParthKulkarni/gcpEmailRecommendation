Because what's below testing/ was copied over from unstable/, and what's
below unstable/ is being copied from the results of the debian-installer
upload, which fetches its components from testing (that's our release
cycle works: we hammer testing into shape until it gets released as a
new stable). So a new kernel in unstable isn't sufficient to have all
the pieces together, that's why we have daily builds, and that's why you
keep being pointed at them.
