Whatever it means, it sounds very wrong.
I see you guys like discussing workarounds, but how about, you know,
actually publishing the correct kernel for netboot in the repo?
Somebody used to do that, why isn't it the case now?
http://debian.backend.mirrors.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/
Netboot's been broken for weeks, how is that normal? And please, don't
bring up snapshots.debian.org again. Modules and kernel are in the same
repository tree, how exactly it happens that keep mismatching?
Can my virt-install just work, huh?
