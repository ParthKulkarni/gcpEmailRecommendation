That's unfortunate, yes, but there's no easy way to keep old packages
around in a given repository. So you've got to wait for a release (and
there won't be one for each and every linux upload), or you've got to
adapt your workflow. Testing is work in progress, and this issue won't
be present in released distributions anyway.
