See description here:
  http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/
“latest d-i” is ambiguous. It can be the latest d-i build (see
https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/daily-build-overview.html), or the
latest d-i release (D-I Stretch RC 1 right now).
The image you're trying to use uses the former definition of “latest
d-i”, as explained on the link above.

I downloaded the iso directly instead of going through the jigdo dance,
because it's oh so simpler, but maybe I hit a different iso, which would
be slightly surprising… Anyway, I'm busy trying to find a workaround for
RC 2 right now, so I'll avoid spending more time on this.

OK, fair. I know for a fact this works with Debian 8 since I've used
this many time for Debian/Linux teaching sessions, with RAID1 and
encrypted LVM on top of it; purposefully breaking the encrypted LVM
(removing cryptsetup) then repairing from rescue mode.

Thanks already!
