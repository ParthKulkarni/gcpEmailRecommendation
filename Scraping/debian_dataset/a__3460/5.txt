Hi,

Well that isn't D-I Stretch RC 1 then. That one lives under:

cryptsetup is the component installed in /target (the installed system),
not what d-i uses.
Anyway, trying this image:
f234f4aa708bdb226c0f412e85c37541c654526e  downloads/debian-testing-amd64-netinst.iso
(According to syslog: Jan 31 20:15:20 cdrom-detect: Detected CD 'Debian GNU/Linux testing "Stretch" - Official Snapshot amd64 NETINST Binary-1 20170131-16:00')
with a VM installed with guided encrypted LVM, and starting graphical
rescue mode, I'm getting prompted for a passphrase to unlock /dev/sda5
as expected, so d-i seems to behave properly.
