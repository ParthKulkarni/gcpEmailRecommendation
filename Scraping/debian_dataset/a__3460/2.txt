I downloaded the testing installer using Jigdo from here:
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/jigdo-cd/debian-testing-amd64-netinst.jigdo
because the Jessie installer in 8.7.1 would not work for me (#750586).

When I tried to run the installer in the "rescue" mode, it did not
prompt me with anything, but when it said something like "partition
disks", it did not have any crypto entries. On the console, it was
complaining about two missing modules, one of which ended with _crypto.
I looked for cryptsetup, but could not find it.

I am sorry, but currently I can't produce those logs.
Cheers,
