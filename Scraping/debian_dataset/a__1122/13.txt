Are you actually using a terminal software between the serial output and
your Konsole?  If not, it is not surprising bogus things happen, see the
manual, you can e.g. use screen in between to convert from vt102 to your
Konsole desires.
More precisely, the issue here seems to be with ACS, which is spuriously
getting set (or perhaps rather missing getting cleared) by your terminal
here.
