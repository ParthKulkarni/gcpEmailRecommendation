I'm interested how this could happend..
I have once experience only on porterbox to debug FTBFS issue of a pkg, but I don't know it can debug d-i.
Could you kindly help on the following?
 - I guess my porterbox access has been expired. Do I need to apply it again in nm.debian.org? or you can enable my account (rosh) on your sparc64 porterbox?
 - How to start d-i in porterbox?
I'm travelling this week so it'd be appreciated the above question could be answered by next Monday (Mar. 20).
Cheers,
