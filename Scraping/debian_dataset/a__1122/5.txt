I am using telnet to connect to the LDOM virtual serial console on the
SPARC T5.  I have also tested nc with the same result. Further tests have
also shown that all ncurses applications are affected by this. Running
htop inside screen over the serial console on the SPARC T5 also results
in garbage.
Michael Karcher (CC'ed) has debugged this issue and he says that the
problem is that the LDOM serial console is eating away some characters
after the "smacs" sequence is sent and "rmacs" is never received, hence
the terminal stays in the alternate character set mode.

So far I have reproduced this issue on the SPARC T5 only and apparently
other users of SPARC hardware have seen the problem as well. It can
be easily reproduced by running any ncurses application inside screen
over the SPARC serial console. I have tried reproducing it on an old
SuperH embedded board with a serial console and a Tabor A1222 embedded
PowerPC e500v2 board, in both cases the problem was not reproducible.
So it seems to be a bug in the firmware of the affected SPARC boxes.
