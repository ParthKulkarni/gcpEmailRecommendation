Hi!
I generated a new set of installation images for sparc64 yesterday [1].
While the generation of the images went without problems, debian-
installer itself has issues now when using a serial console terminal.
One of the issues on the serial console has already been reported by
YunQiang Su in #854588 [2]: Using the cursor keys randomly generates
<ESC> key presses, so that pressing <Down> can lead to debian-installer
jump to the previous menu, for example.
The second issue we are seeing is that the terminal output is garbage
with the default terminal settings. I have taken some screenshots
of a serial console connected to a SPARC-T5 machine [3].
Basically, it works when booting with TERM_TYPE=linux (no colors)
or TERM=ansi (setting TERM=linux produces garbage as well). It
does not work when not setting TERM or TERM_TYPE at all or when
setting TERM to vt102.
Both issues did not exist with previous versions of debian-installer,
the sparc64 images generated in May 2016 [4] work just fine on
the SPARC's serial console.
I suspect that the regressions are related to Roger Shimizu's patch
to add support for GNU screen to debian-installer. I am therefore
adding Roger to the CC list of this bug report. He - or anyone
else - can also get access to a sparc64 porterbox to perform
installation tests. We - the sparc64 porters - are happy to
assist with these efforts.
Thanks,
Adrian
