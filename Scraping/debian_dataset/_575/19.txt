Let's have a bug number for that, then. Please escalate its severity if you
think that's correct.
Steps to reproduce:
* install Debian (I used vmdebootstrap according to autopkgtest-virt-qemu(1))
* apt install sysvinit-core
* reboot
* mount
* ls -al /dev/shm /root/shm
Expected result:
* /dev/shm is a tmpfs
* /run/shm is a symlink with target /dev/shm
Actual result:
* /dev/shm is a symlink with target /run/shm
* /run/shm is a tmpfs
