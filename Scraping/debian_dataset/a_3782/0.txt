Yes, updated GCC builds will be released via security.debian.org (and
provide the basis for a linux update), but those are still WIP.
The GCC 6 branch is still open and stretch updates will be based on that
once HJ Lu's patches have been merged there.
He also maintains a 4.9 branch of his patches on Github, but those
are still in flux. When they are finalised they'll provide the basis
for a jessie update.
