I think you've pointed in the right direction.  I have started reading through 
https://adaptivepatchwork.com/2012/03/01/mind-the-end-of-your-line/ 
and discovered that I have one non-default: core.autocrlf=input.  According to 
the article, this is recommended for linux.  Maybe that's not true; or maybe I 
just need to generate a .gitattributes file?  I'll try that tomorrow.
Thanks,
