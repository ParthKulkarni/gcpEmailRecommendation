I think you have configured your git to auto convert the line ending
when commit.
In the pristine-tar tarball,
$ file googletest-release-1.8.1/googlemock/msvc/2005/gmock.sln
googletest-release-1.8.1/googlemock/msvc/2005/gmock.sln: UTF-8 Unicode
(with BOM) text, with CRLF line terminators
In your master and upstream branch
$ file googletest-1.8.1/googlemock/msvc/2005/gmock.sln
googletest-1.8.1/googlemock/msvc/2005/gmock.sln: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) tex
I import the orig tarball in my env, these files are CRLF in my git tree.
I'm not sure what git config influences this, but maybe core.eol,
core.autocrlf, core.safecrlf.
I'm just using the default values, at least my `git config --list`
output didn't show anything related.
