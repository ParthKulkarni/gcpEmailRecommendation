Hey guys,
APT will shortly start validating that the Date field in a release
file is not (too far) in the future. This might have implications
for installing on devices with an inaccurate clock, as they might
now fail.
There are two primary workarounds:
* Set Acquire::Check-Date to false
* Set check-date sources.list option to false
It's a bit unclear if this only affects validation of the Date field,
or also turns off Validation of the Valid-Until field (as a generic "turn
off all date-related checks" option). Opinions on that?
Thanks,
Julian
