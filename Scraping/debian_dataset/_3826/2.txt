OK, so you're only providing the netinst ISO?  Somehow I got the
impression that you were providing a separate initramfs.  Sorry for the
irrelevant answer.

It's both!  libvirt can provide (through QEMU) an emulated CD drive
attached to an Intel PATA controller, Intel SATA controller, LSI Logic
SCSI controller or virtio SCSI controller.  I've just verified that the
installer works for all of the first three options, but not virtio.
If there's an option to configure the CD drive to be attached through
one of the other controllers, you should choose that.  But we should
also add virtio drivers to the standard installer initramfs.
