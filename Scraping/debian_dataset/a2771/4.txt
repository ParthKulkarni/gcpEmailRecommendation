Yes, it is meant to work. But it is not as guaranteed to work as -O2
simply because the majority of packages are built with -O2. So, there
is some potential of things breaking.
Of course, these issues should be fixed and I will file a bug report
on the problem. I just meant that varying the optimization levels
is not something that you can expect to work in 100% of the cases.
