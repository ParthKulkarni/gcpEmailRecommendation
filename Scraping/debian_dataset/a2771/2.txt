I have just done a testbuild of the current busybox package with
the new default gcc-8 and I can confirm the problem no longer exists,
busybox works correctly again, without any modifications:
root@pacman:~# busybox | head
BusyBox v1.27.2 (Debian 1:1.27.2-3) multi-call binary.
BusyBox is copyrighted by many authors between 1998-2015.
Licensed under GPLv2. See source distribution for detailed
copyright notices.
Usage: busybox [function [arguments]...]
   or: busybox --list[-full]
   or: busybox --install [-s] [DIR]
   or: function [arguments]...
root@pacman:~# busybox ash -c 'echo ${x}'
root@pacman:~#
I have also unblocked the busybox package on the buildds.
Adrian
