When discussing virtual machines it would be helpful to mention which virtual
machine hypervisor is being used, because the resulting behavior can differ
depending on hypervisor.  For instance (at least at one time) it was possible to
install a 64-bit Debian on a 32-bit host under VirtualBox, but not under some
other hypervisors.  [e.g. hypervisors -- Hyper-V, VirtualBox, VMware, Xen, KVM.]
And as Peter Green mentioned, most of the hypervisors require certain BIOS
features [VT-x or AMD-V] to be active before a virtual machine can be installed.
(VirtualBox didn't require this at one time, but seems to require it with
version 2 and up.)
