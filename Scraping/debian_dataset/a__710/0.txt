Thanks for confirming.
For the record, grub's configuration updater is running os-prober to try
and find other systems on various discs, so that they can be listed in
grub's menu.
Workaround 1: (proaction)
-------------
If you want, you can test the following workaround: when you're reaching
the ‚ÄúInstall the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?‚Äù prompt,
switch to a console, and remove this file:
    rm /target/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober
This will prevent update-grub from running os-prober, which should avoid
running into this issue. Of course, other operating systems won't be
listed, but at least that should prevent the installation process from
getting entirely stuck. I've tested this successfully in a VM with
guided (unencrypted) LVM, and standard plus ssh tasks (which is how I
initially reproduced your issue).
Workaround 2: (reaction)
-------------
Otherwise, once the process is stuck, locate the process identifier
(PID) on the first column of the ps output:
    ps | grep 'dmsetup create'
then kill this dmsetup process. With your output above, that'd be:
    kill 19676
(Tested successfully in a VM with the same setup/choices as above.)
