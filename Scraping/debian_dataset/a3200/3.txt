Description: Recipe application for GNOME
GNOME Recipes is an easy-to-use application that will help you to discover
what to cook for today, tomorrow, the rest of the week, and your special
occasions.
GNOME Recipes comes with a collection of recipes that have been collected
by GNOME contributors from all over the world. It also lets you store your
own recipes, and share them with your friends.
I am a Debian Maintainer and I intend to package this within the
Debian GNOME Packaging Team.
