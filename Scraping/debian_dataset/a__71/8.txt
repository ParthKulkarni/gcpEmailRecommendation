Hello everyone, on behalf the salsa-ci-team we would like to spread the word
about the Continuous Integration pipeline we have created for Debian
Maintainers/Developers.
The main idea is to have faster feedback when you are working in a package if
it has the quality needed to be part of the Debian archive. The tests we got
working so far, are the following:
* Building the package from the source (only gbp is supported for now)
* Lintian check
* Reproducible build (Using reprotest)
* piuparts
* Autopkgtest
Please follow the README[0] to enable CI in your packages.
