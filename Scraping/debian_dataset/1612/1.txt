Yes. Somewhat discussed in https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=568897
and marked willnotfix.
Debhelper doesn't automagically do anything due to profiles SFAIK.
Hmm. actually it recently learned how to do nodoc automatically:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=865869
so having started down that slippery slope maybe it's time to ponder
568897 again as its under new management :-)

Right, I generally expect the packaging to have to deal with
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, which deals with actions. DEB_BUILD_PROFILES deals
with dependencies (so dpkg and apt do some things automagically for
you).
Helmut and Josch have a lot more to with this recently than me and
will no doubt be along soon with chapter and verse.
