Hello,
The BuildProfileSpec on the wiki [1] defines the `nocheck` profile as:
> No test suite should be run, and build dependencies used only for that
purpose should be ignored. Builds that set this profile must also add
`nocheck` to `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS`
```
I understand this as saying that the debhelper step for dh_auto_test or
override_dh_auto_test would be automatically skipped if this profile is
defined. Am I mistaken? I'm asking because I've seen the following
pattern in a couple of packages already:
```
ifeq (,$(findstring nocheck, $(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))
override_dh_auto_test:
	commands...
        commands...
else
override_dh_auto_test:
endif
```
Thanks and regards
Afif
