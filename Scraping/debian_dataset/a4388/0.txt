Dear maintainers,
I just ran into this bug as well and just like for Bernhard, it had me
pulling my hair for a couple of hours before I realized what was wrong:

As you can see, chroot will run the applet rather than the binary
unless the full path is given. While this *may* be useful in some
situations, it can also lead to *really* subtle failures in others, so
I'm raising the severity of this bug. Please consider applying
Bernhard's patch if possible or at least documenting this behaviour!
Best regards
