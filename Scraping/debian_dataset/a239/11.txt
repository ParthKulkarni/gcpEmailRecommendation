And that has little to do with what ends up in the archive, unlike
other files dak processes: those usually are what ends up in the
archive, but here it's just random data that might lie about what ends
up in thhe archive.

There are issues with files named _amd64.changes in the same cases
where there are issues with files named _amd64.buildinfo, just that is
much worse with _amd64.buildinfo as one cannot rename them (see the
.changes why that is so).
(Uploads to unstable usually don't trigger that problem.)

Or fixed to just silently discard .buildinfo files that might not work.
Or reject them always (though that also causes issues because arch:all
uploads also seem to get a _amd64.buildinfo, except when they come from
the buildds).
