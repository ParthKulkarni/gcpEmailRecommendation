So what would be needed to make at least a simple export of the data
happen? I think the requirements I'd have are these:
* Data is sufficiently fresh and optimally accessible before the mirror
pulse happens so that you can always fetch the corresponding buildinfo
for a newly pushed package.
* Some way of actually deducing the path to the buildinfo file, either
through some sort of redirector or by naming the files in a consistent
fashion.
Right now the second point does not work with the date-based farm that
is used to archive the buildinfo files. It would work if we were to just
apply the same splitting as in the regular pool. For the former just
pushing the content through static.d.o should work and dak could push
the content before pushing the mirrors?
Intuitively I would not care about cryptographic authentication of the
data. After all it can be verified by rebuilding if the package is
reproducible.
Kind regards and thanks
