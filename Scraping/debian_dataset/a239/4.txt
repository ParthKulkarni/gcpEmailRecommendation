Both wrong, the buildd uploads were REJECTed as the _arch.changes
already existed in the archive.

I just drop the buildinfo file from the _source.changes manually.
I believe thereâ€™s an unclearness about what exactly a buildinfo file
is and what exactly the arch qualifier in its name stands for, while
there *is* a clear definition that each filename may occur in the
archive at most once.
I think itâ€™s best that the persons responsible for creating those
buildinfo files comment on the scope of then, after which it should
be decided whether
1) *_source.changes should never list a buildinfo file, or
2) *_source.changes may list a *_source.buildinfo file, or
3) something else that does not work with the way the archive works.
