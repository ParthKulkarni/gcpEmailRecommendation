Not likely, I think, since for example there's almost no hardware
available for end-users to buy (or to use for buildds), and this will
probably be the case at least until the freeze [*].
Another reason is that there're missing key components that need to get
to the main upstream repos, like GDB, LLVM, Rust, JIT support for
OpenJDK, etc.
GDB is being upstreamed right now, but there's still way to go for the
rest.
[*] Unlike other arches, this one is not restricted to a single vendor
   so hardware can be annouced at any time from unexpected parties;
   still, only a few months are left.
