Do either of these things provide an autopkgtest virt server ?
That's an executable you can run and speak a protocol to do virty
kinds of things.
sbuild and autopkgtest can use any virt system provided in that form.
And other tools which can rely on that interface automatically get
support for:
  schroot lxc lxd qemu
and for running in another environment (without snapshots) via
  chroot ssh
and of course there is also
  null
which just runs things in the calling environment.
/usr/share/doc/autopkgtest/README.virtualisation-server.html in
autopkgtest.deb is the protocol doc - but of course a human user
doesn't have to speak that.  Here's the manpage for adt-virt-schroot:
https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/autopkgtest/adt-virt-schroot.1.en.html
I don't really know why one would want to build a new tool of the form
"does tests or builds or something with testbeds managed by my pet
virtualisaton or container scheme".  Why not write adt-virt-docker ?
Ian.
