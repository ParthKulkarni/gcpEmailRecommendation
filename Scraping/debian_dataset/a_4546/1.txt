And it has --schroot, and just noticed that it also has --docker-image.
I used the former in the recent past, though not the latter.
       --schroot=SCHROOT-NAME
           Use schroot session named SCHROOT-NAME for the testing environment, instead of building a new one with debootstrap.
       --docker-image=DOCKER-IMAGE
           Use a container created from the docker image DOCKER-IMAGE for the testing environment, instead of building a new one with
           debootstrap. This only supports overlay2 for now and it uses the MergedDir layer where piuparts can access, add, edit and
           remove files easily.
