Hi,
Being back from a rather busy quarter, I'd like to resume releasing d-i
more frequently. I'd like to publish a new alpha somewhen during the
next few days/weeks (if that's fine with debian-cd).
If you have changes pending in master branches that need uploading, or
specific packages that need to reach testing, please mention which, and
why.
On the release team side, there's an ongoing qt transition. I'll assess
whether/when it makes sense to freeze all udeb-producing packages once
I've received feedback regarding needed packages.
Cheers,
--
