My brief 2p - I hope we can improve the interaction and experience of
LTS for the whole project: although I don't use (yet) or contribute
(yet) to the LTS effort, I think it's a *great* idea and a real benefit
to Debian in the world. I'm glad some friends are able to support
themselves by working on Debian.
