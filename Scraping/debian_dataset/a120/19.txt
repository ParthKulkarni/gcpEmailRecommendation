I disagree with the statement that there's nothing wrong with this.
We should not be in the business of distributing known-vulnerable
software.  There are practical considerations around point releases and
such which makes this not-really-true for a period of time after there's
a security update out, but this gets converged at each point release. If
you look cdimage.d.o, we are only distributing the latest point release.
I think the same standard should apply to cloud images.
