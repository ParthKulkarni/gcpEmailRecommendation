Just a data point: under pressure from downstream consumers the
OpenStack project implemented longer-but-reduced support for each of
its major coordinated releases. In an effort to avoid the confusion
seen here over "LTS" they opted to refer to it as "Extended
Maintenance" instead. Like Debian's LTS, the idea is that all major
releases switch to EM once they reach what would originally have
been their EOL date, and EM is continued on them for as long as the
downstream stakeholders interested in those releases are willing to
put in the effort to review critical fixes and keep those particular
branches tested (which in many cases may also mean investing in and
getting involved with assisting the OpenStack community's equivalent
of the DSA to keep the necessary test infrastructure to support
those older releases maintained and viable).
