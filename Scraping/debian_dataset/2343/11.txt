On machines running unstable, I wish again and again for a way to tell apt
"do upgrade this package if possible, but never even contemplate removing
it".  This can be avoided by answering the question over and over, but this
gets tedious if the breakage lasts a week.  This is drastically worse on
second-class ports (apt tries to remove git because of git-man like half of
the time recently), but even on amd64 in-progress transitions are common.
So far I make equivs packages "keep-foo" and apt-mark hold them.  This
doesn't work that well.
Thus I wonder, is there a better way?
If not, adding a new mark "apt-mark unremovable" would be nice.
Meow!
