While that would be a good idea, I believe that software using "tor" in
their name needs to be acknowledged by the Torproject, see
https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html
We've however seen from previous experience that software not made by
the the Torproject is kindly requested to be named differently, hence
for example Tails' previously called tor-monitor software has been
renamed to "onioncircuits".

I don't know what this name change was motivated by.

See above. If anything, the package could use the `onion` prefix in
Debian, but as this is not policy and IMO even adds more complexity, it
could also simply use the upstream name as initially suggested by Ju.
