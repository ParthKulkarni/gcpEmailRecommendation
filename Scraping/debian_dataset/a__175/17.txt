Yes!

You need online access to make use of the above information in any way.
If you want to contact the maintainer you need internet access, if you
want to visit the upstream homepage you need internet access, etc. These
information are distribution-independent because they are either the
same like "Homepage" or you could simply look them up if you define a
common and central platform like tracker.debian.org as your main hub for
external/additional/random information about package X. Look how Fedora
have solved the same issue. They have https://src.fedoraproject.org/ and
everything is organized by convention in an identical way. There is no
need for them to put the same information into their spec files and they
also have derivatives. Be sure Ubuntu or Mint users don't care about our
Vcs or maintainer fields as well.

I don't understand why some people always think it is smart to create or
use some new program or tool to solve a problem when the most efficient
way would be to solve a problem non-programmatically. Reduce the
complexity by defining conventions which all developers have to follow
in Debian like maintaining external information in tracker.debian.org
instead of the source package. A switch of Vcs platform would become a
trivial matter in the future by replacing some strings on the server. It
would take seconds and could be solved by a single person. I have
already seen hundreds of uploads just for the sake of changing the
Vcs-fields in debian/control. That is crazy.

If you store this information on tracker.debian.org there would be no
delay and no inconvenience for downstreams at all. In most circumstances
they have their own "tracker.debian.org" service like launchpad.net.
Things like the maintainer or Vcs field get overridden anyway and other
information could be provided via a simple API and thus kept in sync
with their services.
