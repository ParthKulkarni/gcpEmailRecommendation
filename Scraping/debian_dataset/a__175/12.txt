I admit I have also not read these arguments before and I agree that it
makes sense to have some set of metainformation inside a package since
we need to assume that users are dealing with packages differently than
how we expect.
To give an example how science oriented Blends are dealing with
citations (= very specific metadata):  The citations are part of the
source package (in debian/upstream/metadata[1]) but all real
applications that are consuming the data are taking them from UDD[2].
The UDD gatherer is not reading this information from uploaded source
packages but rather from VCS (since some weeks pointing to Salsa now).
So all (at least all that are known to me) applications get up to date
information about citations relevant for a package from Git without any
need to upload a package but the package contains the metadata that are
up to date at the time of upload.
If I understood correctly this is the principle Guillem wanted to
suggest.
Kind regards
        Andreas.
