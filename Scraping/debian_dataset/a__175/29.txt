Are that practical concerns or theoretical objections to the generality
of the statement?
You can still compose the email message, you'll just add the recipient

Yeah, you can't bookmark the URL - but why would you? Just "bookmark"
the name of the package, and once you have internet access use the
(pre-existing) bookmark to the site that will give you a link to the
upstream homepage.

Does "plenty" refer to the two examples you gave?
