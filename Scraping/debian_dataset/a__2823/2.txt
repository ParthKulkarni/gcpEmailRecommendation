Can confirm this bug on the live installer - tried both XFCE and LXDE
versions.
Never expected such goof up on a debian stable version!
Granted that its just released, but we do go through ages of testing
before reaching stable, don't we? The reason a user comes to debian in
the first place is stability. If you don't even get that, then what is
the rationale for using debian stable against something like Ubuntu LTS
where you get both stability and newer packages?
