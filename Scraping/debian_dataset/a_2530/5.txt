That is just your bias (happens to be mine, too).  If their sampling
space is unbiased, a lot of the people in it won't agree with it being a
problem, though.
Unfortunately, the choice of survey tools will bias who will participate
on the survey, so it *is* indeed relevant to the survey results.  But to
unbias it you'd need tools that are neutral on almost every aspect (and
that includes usability by the survey-taking participants, for example).
