While it may have been copied to -devel, Ian's e-mail was not an example
of doing work in Debian, but instead an example of academic engagement.
Academia is very different to a project like Debian, and the standards
of discourse are correspondingly different (perhaps most important is
the fact that academics are not volunteers).
While I agree with you that Ian's tone would not have been appropriate
in, say, a bug report, it strikes me as quite appropriate for the kind
of academic dialogue in which he is engaged.
We should be wary of applying the advice in the ignoring negativity
panels, and similar, to work outside of Debian.  That advice was
tailored for working on Debian, which was not what Ian is doing here.
While the advice may well apply to other endeavours, we should not
assume that it does without argument.
