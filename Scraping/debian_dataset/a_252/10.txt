My understanding is that the libressl project does not support a release 
for the length of a debian release cycle, and does not commit to API 
stability for debian-cycle periods. (The openbsd model historically is 
to break ABI and even API between releases, in order to minimize 
compatability code, which works with their rebuild-the-world release 
model.) Is there any sign that if debian packages libressl in order to 
use openssh, debian would not end up being the de facto maintainers of 
an unsupported years-old libressl release by the end of a debian 
stable release cycle (not to mention debian LTS)? I think that in 
practical terms that would leave us worse off than settling on a 
compatability layer that's shared with other distributions.
