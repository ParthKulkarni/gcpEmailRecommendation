Isn't that ultimately similar to the "portable ssh" efforts in general?
Realistically OpenSSL 1.0.2 will be gone from all major distros in at
least a year, so there will a practical need for this shim one way or the other.

Keeping libcrypto on life support for say another year is probably
the least bad option for now. I haven't done any exact research but the majority
of security issues surely affects libssl.

Ack. Michael Stone already discussed this to great extent and there's not
really much to add. I doubt LibreSSL is a suitable option for Debian in
general.

I doubt SLES or RHEL would accept this as a viable approach for sshd in their
next enterprise releases. If no officially maintained shim appears, we can
discuss this a one of the options in a year I'd say.

I agree that's not something for Debian alone. But if there were a properly
maintained semi official shim use by all major distros (and this way ultimately
the vast majority of openssh users!), might be different though?

Certainly not :-)
