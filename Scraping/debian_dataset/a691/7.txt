The fact that the NEW queue is continuely growing is a sign that DDs are
continuosely motivated to fill it up. ;-)  As Mattia said in his
response patience is a feature you learn as DD and it is not a bad
feature.

I have not seen any applause in this thread for your offer to help.  I
hereby do this and thank you explicitly.  I have learned that e-mails to
ftp-master work way worse than IRC via #debian-ftp.  May be you repeat
your offer there.
I personally admit that getting no response to e-mails is more draining
on the patience than waiting for getting a package acceptet.  Thus
knowing this alternative channel helped me a lot.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
