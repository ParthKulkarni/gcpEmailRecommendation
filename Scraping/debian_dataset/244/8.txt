Ok, let me rephrase.  "At times in the past" there were delays simply do you
ftpmasters now expecting (in the case of R packages) debian/README.source to
explain the (data, binary, but for R also always already documented) .rda
files.
It would be so much simpler if "we" could just read the output, if any, that
is holding things back.  The new package tracker is great and shows a lot,
but in order _for us to help you_ we need to know what you want us to change.

He is not listed in DESCRIPTION:

    email = "jan.garbuszus@ruhr-uni-bochum.de", role = c("aut")),
    person("Sebastian", "Jeworutzki",

    person("Giovanni", "Righi", role="ctb")
    )
though "R Core" is, and for many years they (ie R Core) assume copyright
jointly.
Where would you want me to make the attribution? debian/copyright?

I will try.  And where please should I send requests to ftpmaster ?
