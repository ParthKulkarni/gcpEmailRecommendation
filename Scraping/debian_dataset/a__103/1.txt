The dev ref is quite clear about the right of porters to NMU:
# 5.10.2.2.¬†When to do a source NMU if you are a porter
[...]
#   If you are a porter doing an NMU for unstable, the above
#   guidelines for porting should be followed, with two variations.
#   Firstly, the acceptable waiting period ‚Äî the time between when
#   the bug is submitted to the BTS and when it is OK to do an NMU ‚Äî
#¬†¬† is seven days for porters working on the unstable distribution.
#   This period can be shortened if the problem is critical and
#   imposes hardship on the porting effort, at the discretion of the
#   porter group. (Remember, none of this is Policy, just mutually
#   agreed upon guidelines.) For uploads to stable or testing, please
#   coordinate with the appropriate release team first.
Broken cmake pretty much stops the whole port (as it has direct and indirect
rbdeps all around), this certainly counts as a "hardship".

Stopping a whole port for a reason as flimsy as "I'm not interested in
maintaining patches for things that clearly belong upstream." sounds like
something that warrants escalation, yeah.
