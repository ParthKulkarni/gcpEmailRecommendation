Regardless who is submitting patches upstream, two problem remains:
1) The delay until upstream makes a new release.
2) The delay until the Debian Maintainer creates an updated package from that
release (if ever). Example: emacs26
And how many maintainers do cherry-pick patches accepted upstream, very few :(
