Hi,
With my debian-ports hat on, let me answer the parts related to that.
First of all as a reminder, debian-ports was originally just there to
help bootstrapping an architecture and prove it meets the ftpmasters
criteria to become an official architecture. It has been used that way
for example for armel, armhf, arm64, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386 and
s390x.

Yes both instances have been merged during Debconf 15.

For what I understand the release team schedule binNMUs on all
architectures that have the necessary packages built. As long as the
architecture is not lagging that should therefore be the case.

debian-ports is only about hosting the archive, so we do not have that.
I guess that would need to be added the same way as for the buildd.d.o
merge.

I agree for the mirroring part, that's why there are very few
debian-ports mirrors (the original plan was even to have none of them)
and that it is served through the deb.debian.org CDN.
Besides that mirroring aspect, I agree moving an architecture from
the official to the debian-ports archive is just moving the load to a
different set of Debian person and different set of Debian hardware.

Aurelien
