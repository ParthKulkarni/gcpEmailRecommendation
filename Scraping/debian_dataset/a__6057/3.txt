Michael Karcher (CC'ed) has had a go at this and it seems it is an issue
with the serial connection dropping some characters during transmission.
Since the cursor keys generate escape sequences in the terminal, the
transmission for a cursor key press needs to be stable over several
characters.
Invoking "infocmp ansi" will print out the escape sequences for various
terminal actions. The cursor movement is controlled by these sequences:
        cr=^M, cub=\E[%p1%dD, cub1=\E[D, cud=\E[%p1%dB, cud1=\E[B,
        cuf=\E[%p1%dC, cuf1=\E[C, cup=\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH,
        cuu=\E[%p1%dA, cuu1=\E[A, dch=\E[%p1%dP, dch1=\E[P,
As you can see, these sequences usually involve <ESCAPE> plus additional
characters. So, what happens in the case of Debian installer is that the
characters after the <ESCAPE> are dropped and instead of the escape sequence,
the terminal application (debian-installer) is receiving <ESCAPE> only
which results in an escape key press.
As possible cause for the issue might be a bug in the FIFO implementation
of the serial connection. Michael will hopefully correct me if I am wrong.
Thanks,
Adrian
