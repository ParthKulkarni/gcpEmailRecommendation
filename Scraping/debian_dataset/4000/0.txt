Is that really true?
Fwiw, the consolekit package, before it was removed completely, was
!linux-any, ie. it was only built for non-release architectures.
Why not just upload librsvg-c as regular any package.
Once it has passed NEW, I would make a second, source-only upload which
lists only the non-rust architectures and I'd ask ftp-masters for the
removal of the binaries on the rust architectures.
