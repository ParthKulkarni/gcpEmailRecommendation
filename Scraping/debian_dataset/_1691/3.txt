Looks good to me.

Comparing a Section field in the archive and a Depends list, I can
imagine we would have to arch-{qualify,filter} quite a number of
packages, which might be less convenient than just relying on the
archive contents.
On the other hand, I think it would be better to be able to track the
packages getting installed over time, instead of hoping for the best
when this or that package gets a (sometimes uncoordinated) priority
bump in the archive.
Initial impression is still that such a change might be welcome at
some point, but it needs to be carefully considered on the installer
side. This might also affect downstreams.
That being said, I'm very low on bandwidth right now, with 9.0.*
fixing and/or debugging, plus 9.1 preparations.
