But is that actually true ?

I don't know what `background networking' is, precisely, in this
context, but it doesn't sound like something nice.
It still seems likely to me that the problem here is a code problem,
and that people who find the current behaviour unpleasant should try
to figure out how to make the code DTRT, rather than fighting over a
bad choice between different bad default configurations.

This is a separate question.  Ideally, as I say, Chromium would not
access external repositori(es) for extensions unless they either
contain only Free Softare, or the user has enabled Debian control
(and, presumably, installed some chromium-nonfreeapp-store package, or
something).
But certainly it should not phone home for extensions unless the user
explicitly asks to review or search for available extensions, or has
non-Debian-packages extensions installed.
