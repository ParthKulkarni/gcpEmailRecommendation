Indeed.
#841401 is more or less this:
- my extensions cannot be updated
- that's to address some of the concern about unrequested network
  connections
- if you disable updating extensions then you should disable installing
  them too as the current situation is stupid
- done

That's true. That's why the usual reaction to #841401 outcome is "huh?".

I guess the real question is "why updating extensions was disabled in the
first place". If chromium phones home only when non-packaged extensions
are actually installed then it doesn't happen until the user installs
them. I'm sure there are people who would forbid the users from doing that
but...
