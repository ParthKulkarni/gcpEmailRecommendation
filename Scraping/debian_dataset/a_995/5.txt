Hi,
based on some random chatter on IRC I noticed that many people now
have their own way of passing --enable-remote-extensions to chromium.
The workarounds range from system wide stuff in /etc/chromium.d/ to
local aliases or script wrapper in a ~/bin/chromium script.
To be honest I've the feeling that we're doing a disservice to our
users when we release stretch with the current defaults. Putting
reasonable security considerations aside I think we should cater our
users and ship a chromium release with reasonsable defaults, so we
do not have to invent our own workarounds to pass just the same flag
in different ways to have a usable chromium.
Michael, Riku what's your take on this issue?
I've found the issue to be tracked in https://bugs.debian.org/851927
but that did not offer any rational about why it's not a default setting
so chromium works like it did in the past.
Maybe my viewpoint is a bit limited because I only use chromium when I've
to rely on some Chrome extensions and otherwise use Firefox. So I was
confused when I noticed this behaviour change and it took a a few minutes
and some grief to figure what had changed
