Can you provide an example of how, under your proposal, someone who
wants to - e.g. - forbid the installation of any nonfree-gfdl-invariant
packages would do so? I don't see any way to accomplish that based on
Recommends:, precisely because Recommends: can be overridden.
For "Depends: foo", I'd probably try to do it by pinning foo to priority
-1, or something along those lines - but such a pin would do nothing to
prevent packages which only Recommend foo.
I could see a possible way of doing this with Conflicts: or similar,
such that you just install the packages which the ones you want to
prohibit will conflict with - but trying to set up a suitable collection
of antimetapackages to be conflicted against seems like a recipe for
madness.
I hope I'm just missing something, because this looks like a very
interesting idea. With Recommends:, however, it looks like it would do
nothing more than potentially warn the user at install time that a
package which is about to be installed violates this particular freedom
condition - and that doesn't seem like enough of a benefit to be worth
the investment.
