Dividing up nonfree would mean that every nonfree package would have
to be classified into precisely one of the categories.  Also, once we
have established that such finer classification is useful, we would
want to increase the number of categories, which would be very
heavyweight (and exacerbase the taxonomical problem).
Also, it doesn't really deal with contrib.
