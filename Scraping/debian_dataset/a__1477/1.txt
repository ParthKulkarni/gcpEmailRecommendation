Source: iso-scan

Severity: normal

Control: block -1 by 868848 868852
With this patch, I ensure that we activate LVM logical volumes so that
they are visible by "list-devices" and so that they can be scanned too.
That way we are also able to identify ISO images stored within LVM
logical volumes.
    
Obviously this has implications on the rest of the installation process.
The logical volume will be in use and the partitioning step will have
to preserve the logical volume and its parent volume group.
    
But partman is perfectly able to cope with the logical volumes being
already activated so it should be fine to do this here.
    
For this patch to work, we need some changes in:
- debian-installer-utils: https://bugs.debian.org/868848
- debian-installer hd-media image: https://bugs.debian.org/868852
Please find my suggested (and tested) patch attached.
