It would be really good to have such a list, this would ease QA work on
"uncommon" archs. Background: for reproducible builds we're rebuilding
all sid/main packages on amd64, i386, arm64 and armel. And thankfully
people actually look at all these results, both for plain old ftbfs bugs
as well as for reproducible builds issues.
Thus it would be great to mark such packages as "currently ftbfs on
$arch, we know that, it's not great, but expected".
One of way of marking this is certainly to have a bug open, though I can
see how maintainers do not want such bugs to clutter their views of the BTS.
Hmm. Something certainly *is* buggy, if "only" debian/control for not
having a better way to express this. :-)
