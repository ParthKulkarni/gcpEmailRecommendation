I see in dbus_1.12.2-1.dsc
Build-Depends: ...
  valgrind [amd64 arm64 armhf i386 mips64 mips64el mips mipsel powerpc
            ppc64 ppc64el s390x]
	   <!pkg.dbus.minimal>, ...
which is rather WTF.  Is this trying to do Build-Recommends ? :-)
Is this something to do with a test-suite ?  Maybe those tests should
