But if that is not possible, volatile as a separate archive is also

Just for the record - I know you say "a redefined volatile" - and as a 
former volatile team member: This would in no way have been suitable for 
volatile either. Just like backports the assumption is that the packages 
are up to Debian's quality standards and we make the result available to 
users of stable earlier. Volatile's mission statement was keeping 
software like virus scanners actually useful while doing minimal changes 
to stable and that was the main reason for folding it into the regular 
release as well as creating -updates to have a timely push mechanism.[1]
In the Ubuntu PPA case you get free reign over what's in that archive 
and what you backport as part of offering the package. Obviously this 
might conflict with the existing set. But the same is true for a 
centralized volatile archive if you need to backport a large set of 
build dependencies to make the whole thing work in the first place. And 
I'm sure you wouldn't just go for a gitlab source package with bundled 
build dependencies.
Now the policy question of who can ship what in a way that looks 
semi-officially as being part of Debian is tricky. I personally find the 
notion that testing should just be the staging ground for the next 
release to be unfortunate but at the same time know how we ended up with 
it. Maybe there's a place for packages that cannot usefully be supported 
for a stable release and hence need to live in parallel. But then again 
I wonder if the answer wouldn't be an archive where the input is built 
for all suites and where the dependencies are bundled - if only because 
you'd track upstream closely and would through that (hopefully) pull in 
necessary security updates.
[1] And to some degree I am unhappy with backports' team's antagonistic 
view on volatile here. Stuff like gitlab would have been rejected in the 
same way it would've been in backports. The useful bits live on, it 
wasn't abandoned to cause more work for backports. At the same time 
backports can serve as a replacement of a subset of use cases too, where 
its rules fit just fine.
