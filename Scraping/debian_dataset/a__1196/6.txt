That is why I prefer it as an extension of backports where the
dependencies still follow the regular release cycle, they should be in
testing and that means doing proper transitions for breaking changes and
only the gitlab package itself be kept in volatile.

I think it is still possible to maintain dependencies without bundling
if it is like backports, ie, we can update them to newer upstream
versions. Hence the requirement to redefine volatile. If they are not
accepted in backports, a lot of packages will be duplicated, but even
that is okay if backports team is not happy to take the new packages.
And if this discussions go no where, the only option would be to make it
an installer package, like diaspora-installer. But I'm not sure if it'd
add much value over upstream provided omnibus packages.

Thanks for sharing this.
