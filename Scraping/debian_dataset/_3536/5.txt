Hi,
a small note FYI:
I worked on re-activating l10nstats, to get translation statistics for the
installer back.
The changings implied the move from Alioth to Salsa, and also a dist upgrade
vom Wheezy to Stretch.
Finally, there are still some bits not fixed (like spellchecking, which is a
separate cron job; and documentation: I would like to update the docs/comments
in the gen-stats script), but statistics functionality is back.
Yesterday I pushed my final changings.
Last night the cron job broke, because I forgot two changes, which I added
just now. 
But now, l10nstat should be back online.
Holger
