Oh, this reminds me of something.
Has anyone gotten replies to their requests sent to
debian-steam@collabora.com for the Steam subscriptions mentioned in the
MemberBenefits page?
I think that I have sent two mails in the past 3 years but have gotten
no responses.
Should we remove this benefit from the wiki page? Or do we have someone
to contact about it?
Cheers,
