Hi,
For some reason, the netboot installer packages do not contain the
mini.iso files. This is explicitly filtered out by way of a "grep -v
mini.iso", which "git blame" tells me has always been the case.
Anyone know (or remember) why that is so? I think that having .iso files
on a VM host that are auto-updated as the host is updated can be useful,
and so would like to instead see them be part of the installable
installer netboot packages.
Thanks,
