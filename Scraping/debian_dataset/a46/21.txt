Yes, the idea here is to make something that is fit for official Debian
packaging.

Thank you Lisandro! I'm glad I was able to address your concerns, and I
think this has been a really good discussion.
Ian, thanks for the feedback, and if you have minor technical questions
please feel free to ask them, either on- or off-list :)
I think it makes sense for dh-cmake to live primarily in VTK for now,
and then, as we work out the issues, hopefully we will see other
packages start to adopt it as well.
I will keep everyone updated as both dh-cmake and the VTK packaging are
developed. We are hoping for an official Debian release of both
packages towards the end of the year.
Kyle
