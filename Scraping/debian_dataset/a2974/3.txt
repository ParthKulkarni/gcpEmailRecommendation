OK, I'm struggling to reproduce this here. I've just started 2 test
EFI installations in a VM. Create just a single filesystem on a blank
disk with no ESP and I get
  No EFI partition was found.
  Go back to the menu and resume partitioning?
when I say "Finish partitioning". Was there any other OS installed
already on the system?
