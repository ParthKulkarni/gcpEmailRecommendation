That is actually a good point. I wonder if using a local copy might be
a good alternative.

True, but this could be handled by using a better system to access a

Can you actually get openvpn to do this?

I read this not as "insecure for the system it runs on" but "insecure
on the connection side". This is certainly not something you should use
  to open your local network to, or to do something illegal.
