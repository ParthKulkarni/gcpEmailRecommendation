Hi,

If you're going to build using make under build/ directly, you need to
pass a few variables to get appropriate settings. You're lacking at
least USE_UDEBS_FROM, which defaults to unstable:
    build/config/common:USE_UDEBS_FROM ?= unstable
This should work (provided you start from a clean tree):
    make -C build build_netboot USE_UDEBS_FROM=stretch
Alternatively, use dpkg-buildpackage, so that debian/rules sets the
appropriate variables for you.

That's expected given your sources.list: no main/debian-installer
component there, so apt doesn't know about those udebs. Try rmadison
(from devscripts) instead.
By the way, there's a bump from 4.9.0-4 to 4.9.0-5 coming up through
stretch-proposed-updates. I've pushed an updated to the stretch branch
accordingly:
