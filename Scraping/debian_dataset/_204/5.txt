We should not wait for dissent just forever. The issue you mention was
rejected by ftp-masters, then brought to the TC, then dismissed by the
TC as not-our-role-to-overrule-delegates, and some more days
passed. Do you really think there's a brewing dissent within the
ftp-masters team that has not yet bubbled to become public?
