Right.

And no, I didnt say one can not ever challenge a reject, although one
can put that meaning in my words, sorry for that. Quite the contrary,
despite other rumours, we are all just humans, and humans make mistakes.
And we are open to be told about such and do admit them, and yes, that
does happen.
But if you continously "run into the same wall", then it does not do any
good to assume its that one person hating you and that, if you happen to
get to another team member, they will like you. It's the wrong mindset.
Also, possibly we should adjust our communications here, at least get
others to respond/jump in (earlier). Not sure we need it so much formal
as Ian wrote down, but get someone else in early shouldn't hurt.
