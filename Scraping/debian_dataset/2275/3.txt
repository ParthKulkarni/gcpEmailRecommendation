Yes, I agree of course.

I'm referring to policy 2.2, which lists what software belongs in main and what
belongs in contrib.  While this is not voted on and it does not follow directly
from the SC, I thought there was agreement that what's in Policy 2.2 is a good
way to determine where software should go.  In particular, if it is free, but
requires software outside of main to do its job, then it should go in contrib.
People are arguing here that "It requires a network server that is not in main"
is fundamentally different from "it requires local software that is not in
main".  I think they are equivalent; server software is still software and I
don't see why it running remotely suddenly makes it acceptable to depend on it.

Yes, this is about whether our packages should be in main or contrib.  External
software may influence that, but the result is a rule about our package, not
about the external software.

Policy 2.2.  So again, I'm not saying the rules apply to the external software,
I'm just saying that the external software is indeed software and therefore
depending on it requires a package to be moved to contrib if the external
software is not packaged in Debian (main).

Sorry, that is not what I meant.  What I mean with "part of the system" is that
it should be taken into account when deciding what to do with our software.  So
if Foo has chosen to always wear a hat while running /bin/bash, and that is
their shell on your system, then they must not only wear a hat when running
bash locally, but also when they log in at your system.
You don't need to do anything, and you are obviously not bound by their rules.
But your system does mean that they need to do something (if they want to
follow their own rules).
Similarly, if a client program's purpose is to connect to a server that is not
in main, the server operator doesn't need to do anything, but the fact that it
is not in main means (IMO, but apparently that is disputed) that the client
must be in contrib.

Yes, that was unclear.  I meant "part of the system" in the way that you need
to consider all forces in a system if you want to find the acceleration on an
object.  It was not my intention to imply that we have any say over the
external software.
Thanks for your questions, I hope my answers make my position more clear.
Thanks,
Bas
