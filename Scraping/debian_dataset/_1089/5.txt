Hello,
many thanks for your installation report.  Our current Debian installer
builds are based on kernel 4.13, but both the device-tree for the
Banana Pi M3 as well as a number of drivers that are necessary for
supporting A83T-based systems are only available from kernel 4.14
onwards.  Among the latter are support for the MMC controller in the
A83T as well as support for RSB (required for PMIC support), the PMIC
support itself, and USB support.
The situation with the H3/A64/A83T EMAC driver is a bit unfortunate. 
The driver itself was included during the kernel 4.13 development
cycle, but as some issues with the devicetree bindings for the driver
have come up, they have been removed again before the final release of
kernel 4.13 and the discussion about how to handle this properly are
still ongoing.  The driver author has sent in a new proposal a few days
ago, but the proposed changes haven't yet been accepted into the
upstream kernel and it is still unclear whether they will make it into
kernel 4.14, so for the time being, the driver is still unusable.
I am unsure regarding the missing console output without
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL.  In theory the existing UART driver for older
Allwinner SoCs should work on the A83T as well.  Could you perhaps
provide the output of "dmesg" on your board when booted with your
locally-built kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_LL enabled?  Perhaps we can see
something relevant in the kernel log.
Regards,
Karsten
