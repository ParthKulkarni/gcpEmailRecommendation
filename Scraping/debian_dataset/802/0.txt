I wouldn't exactly call them "simple", but src:dbus and src:glib2.0 both
do more than one build of the same Autotools project (one of which is a
cut-down version for the udeb) by doing more than one srcdir != builddir
Autotools build.
In cdbs, doing multiple builds in this way are referred to as "flavors".
I wouldn't recommend cdbs for new packages, but you might find useful
information by using that keyword.
