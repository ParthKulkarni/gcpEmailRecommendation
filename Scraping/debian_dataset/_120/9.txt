I agree that is a concern...

... but, well, that is pretty clear isn't it? "All" releases are
supported, and "stretch" is explicitely mentioned in the table. I think
we've done our part.

I'm not sure we're using it that differently. But it's true normal
stable releases don't immediately get marked as LTS. There are good
reasons for that, and those would be very hard to work around. To get
more explicit, we can answer your questions one by one:
> Should we:
>

No. That would be very confusing, as the stable releases are (to
simplify greatly) under the responsability of the security team (ST) and
the stable release managers (SRM), not the LTS team.

Hm... I'm not sure what that refers to or what you're proposing, but LTS
releases are *not* supported by the security team, but by the LTS team.
> 3) Stop using LTS as a "label" for oldstable releases?
I am not sure how that would help anything. :) I do like, however, the
idea brought by Jeremy Stanley in a reply to your email of using the
"Extended Maintenance" label instead of "Long Term Support" because the
latter is usually attached to a *current* release, while the former is
seen as an *extension*.
But renaming the project seems like a huge undertaking and I'm not sure
it would really resolve this conendrum.

Right. So maybe that's a piece that's been missing in our
communications, and that could be the reason why people still think they
should install jessie cloud images. ;)
So maybe we could make some proeminent statement on the LTS and
LTS/Using pages in the wiki?
> 5) Is that not true anymore with Extended LTS and CIP?
Sorry, what is not true? #4? If so, I think people should *still*
install the latest supported Debian release (stable or stretch right
now) and not LTS or ELTS, when deploying new systems.
I think the idea here is that we think Debian rocks. It's solid, stable,
and we love it. But we want to support it for even longer than what our
volunteer team can deal with right now, so we're hiring a bunch of
dedicated fanatics who can figure out how to fit a square peg in a round
hole for you.
But please don't make us any more square pegs and install Debian
normally. Don't break Debian! :)
