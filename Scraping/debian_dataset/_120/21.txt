Sorry; to be more precise, I meant that there's nothing wrong that can't
be remedied using entirely standard and well-established workflows, e.g.
dist-upgrade. There's no need to add custom apt sources, apt keys, or
anything like that. dist-upgrade is something I'd expect most users to
do pretty early in the lifetime of a cloud instance (and possibly
regularly after that, depending on how long it's expected to remain
active).
