because a build on any architecture will make the arch:all package
appear and then you cannot know whether it's a known missing feature
that the package doesnt build on $arch (or a new problem) or you would
need to introduce state tracking and then you still wouldn't know 
whether a build failure on $arch is a new problem or an old problem,
because maybe it's a temporary problem...
