the rather few people working on (fully and partly) automated QA have to

first, that's partly why I suggested 3 months delays/warnings for these
autoremovals. second, during this time, like for the testing
autoremovals, a simple mail to that bug could+should reset the counter
of that 3 months period again. third, ftpmasters are smart, if exactly the
same package gets reuploaded i'm pretty confident the ftpmasters
can+will detect that easily and make it go through NEW faster. fourth,
sometimes people need incentives to do some work, I believe autoremovals
provide such incentives.
