I'm not sure that's true. Bad advice in an installer is not a good idea.
I've always been unhappy about having it there, and as that previous
bugreport shows, so were you.
In addition, if we're going to change this recommendation, then now (at
the beginning of a new release cycle) is the best time for doing so.
I'd be inclined to agree it should be removed, but I'd be happy to
follow the consensus here.
