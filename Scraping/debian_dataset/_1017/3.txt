I was under the impression that there was quite a lot of evidence to
demonstrate that regular-change policies are a security disaster.
Continuing to recommend such an approach strikes me as pure inertia.
If we want to recommend that people change their passwords later if they
are incapable of choosing a good one immediately, that seems like good
advice, but advising regular changes is just encouraging people to
consume their often quite limited ability to remember decent passwords,
with the almost inevitable result being that they'll either start
choosing poor passwords, or recording them somewhere insecure, neither
of which are better than keeping a decent password that they can
remember.
Cheers, Phil.
