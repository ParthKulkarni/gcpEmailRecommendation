My reading of 7(b) of GPLv3 would be that it is not required.
Have any lawyers or the FSF been consulted on that?

If the ftp team believes that distributing GPL code without copyright 
attributions in debian/copyright is required for license compliance 
reasons, noone except the copyright holders can legally grant an 
exception that allows Debian to distribute that code.
If one copyright holder of a package with an existing ftp team exception 
package would take legal actions against a Debian mirror, what would be 
the official position of Debian regarding the legality of what our
mirror distributes?
