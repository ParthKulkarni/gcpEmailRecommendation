 It's hard, so hard. Because most of users don't use it until it is
 "Released" - Released, then complain about it (of course, there is
 an exception, but... ;)
 So, we should consider "automated testing", IMO.
 openSUSE people uses "openQA" suite, that seems to be useful.

 If we can put it into Debian, CI for live image would be easy.
 Some of components are already in Debian (that I did), but not all of
 them. Still working on it, I'll try my best.
