Alas, all ARMs I personally saw require a device-specific u-boot setup, and
don't allow booting from USB mass storage -- you need a supported kind of
boot device load u-boot, and only that may then chainload from USB.
This is different in those legendary ARMs that have UEFI support, but
they must be a myth.
