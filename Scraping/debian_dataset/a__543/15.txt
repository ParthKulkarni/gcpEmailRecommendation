Hum... You also have some misunderstanding here. Live-build has been
packaged in Debian, and fully part of Debian for *years* (well before
Raphael worked on it).
What changed is that, since Daniel Baumann doesn't build the live images
anymore (let's not go into details why this happened), Steve does it at
the same time as other Debian images. It's now included in a single
process of building images.
