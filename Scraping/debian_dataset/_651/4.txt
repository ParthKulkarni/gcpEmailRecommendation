The diff above is what etckeeper commited when upgrading
console-setup, console-setup-linux and keyboard-configuration, all
from 1.166 to 1.167. And there have been previous commits, so it
wasn't something pending from way past, it took place in the upgrade.
Also, as predicted, "cannot open file /tmp/tmpkbd.31u83e" appeared on
boot, yet mapping looked OK. Anyway, I invoked the other loadkeys by
hand to be sure.
After reading the man page, I decided to run "setupcon --save-only" by
hand... and now the file is back to sane value. Uh!? A bit flipped
during upgrade and naming choice got mangled?
