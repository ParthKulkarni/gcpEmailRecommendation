There is a chance, and I was pushing rather hard for that, but I don't
think this will happen in the near future. It's also one of these
cases where you ask others to do something for you which has never
been a big issue for them.
For the record, see https://forum.dlang.org/post/och4d8$1i1n$1@digitalmars.com
(Very) long-term, there might be a stable, shared ABI, in the short
term though, that definitely won't be the case.
