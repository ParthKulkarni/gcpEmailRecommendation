That was very much my gut feel but I am a little removed from the more core
moving and shaking and I didn't know what changed recently.
FWIW GNU R is an rather obsessively clean user of to the autotools stack, so
I would agree that it failing here is a good-enough proof for having to
possibly revisiting things in our stack. I would expect much more breakage to
follow.
