This was mentioned elsewhere in the thread, but just for the sake of
clarity, Policy doesn't say that.  Policy says only that maintainer
scripts should not hard-code paths.
Whether other binaries should or should not is a somewhat complicated
question that is a little case-dependent.  For instance, we decided in an
earlier debian-devel thread that Perl and Python scripts should hard-code
paths rather than using the env trick.
This therefore makes your point even stronger.
