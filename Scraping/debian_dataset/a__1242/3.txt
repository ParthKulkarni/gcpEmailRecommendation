I don't know how that would be possible.  If it's determined to
hardcode a path, the correct path to hardcode depends on the location
of the non-usrmerge system that the binary might later be installed
on.
Undesirable as baking build-time-detected paths into packages is, I
really don't think we can treat it as an RC bug.
