For scripts this conflicts with the requirement/suggestion to hardcode
the shebang line. I don't know a good general solution, it seems to
require ad hoc extra configuration to fix interpreter paths at build
time (i.e. upstream build system cannot really expect to find
interpreter paths if we move them between build and execution).
