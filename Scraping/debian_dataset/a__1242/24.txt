Are we sure this is fixed?
The build failures appeared in the last two days. These release and patch
notes are from Nov 9 (in the BTS) and before Nov 13 (for Repro Build summary).
As pointed out to me earlier today by Kurt Hornik from the (upstream) R Core
team (whom I have CC'ed here too), if we look at eg the i386 build of r-base
3.5.1-2 resulting from my upload this morning I see line 120 to 123 of
/usr/bin/R having (indented two)
  ## some systems have a more portable sed, e.g. /usr/xpg4/bin/sed on Solaris,
  ## so make sure that is used.
  SED=/usr/bin/sed
  export SED
and that is still WRONG as there is no /usr/bin/sed, only /bin/sed.
R itself use this in configure.ac (again indented two):
  ## we would like a POSIX sed, and need one on Solaris
  AC_PATH_PROGS(SED, sed, /bin/sed, [/usr/xpg4/bin:$PATH])
Similarly, I have had this for many years in debian/rules -- in part because
at one point had mulitple zip versions (until an IP related issue became
better IIRC), multiple print queues, multiple pages, multiple awks etc pp and
what not:
	R_GZIPCMD="/bin/gzip -n"			\
	PAGER=/usr/bin/pager				\
	PERL=/usr/bin/perl				\
	R_UNZIPCMD=/usr/bin/unzip			\
	R_ZIPCMD=/usr/bin/zip				\
	R_PRINTCMD=/usr/bin/lpr				\
	AWK=/usr/bin/awk                                \
We can surely work around / with usrmerge and do more checks -- but it
currently looks to me as if this is still borked for now.
And call me crazy or old-fashioned, but "baking" a configure-time choice into
a script seems preferable to searching the path each time.  We only move /bin
once every fourty years afer all ...
