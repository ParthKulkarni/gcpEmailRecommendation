The log rate-limiting is done in the kernel, so the log daemon doesn't
have to process all those messages.  However, the rate-limiting state
is protected with a mutex (actually a spin-lock) so even when the log
message is suppressed it involves an additional two memory barriers.
And I agree that this kind of rate-limiting isn't really sufficient. 
Warning once per process might be more reasonable, but there's
currently no mechanism for that in the kernel.
