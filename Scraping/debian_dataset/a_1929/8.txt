On arm64 kernels building armhf packages for the reproducible builds
builders, I'm seeing hundreds or even thousands of kernel log warnings
per second when building anything that makes use of
CP15_BARRIER_EMULATION (e.g. anything using ghc):
  [85740.553537] cp15barrier_handler: 115316 callbacks suppressed
  [85740.559358] "ghc-pkg" (29572) uses deprecated CP15 Barrier instruction at 0xf5beaa7c
  [85740.567344] "ghc-pkg" (29572) uses deprecated CP15 Barrier instruction at 0xf5beaa9c
That *might* be sufficient to actually impact performance; it certainly
makes it hard to read other kernel log messages on those machines...
There was a bug reported on ghc related to this:
