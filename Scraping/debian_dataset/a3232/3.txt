It looks as though Meson approximately follows the Autotools-like
build pipeline that dh assumes, so something like this should work:
override_dh_auto_clean:
	rm -fr debian/build
override_dh_auto_configure:
	mkdir -p debian/build
	cd debian/build && meson \
		--prefix=/usr \
		... more options ... \
		CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" \
		... more compiler flags ...
		../..
override_dh_auto_build:
	cd debian/build && ninja -v
override_dh_auto_test:
	cd debian/build && ninja test
override_dh_auto_install:
	cd debian/build && DESTDIR=${CURDIR}/debian/tmp ninja install
(This is all entirely untested and based on what was said in
<https://bugs.debian.org/795253>.)
This could be encapsulated in a debhelper Buildsystem class later, but
I think the first step would be to prototype it using overrides in a small
number of packages in experimental (or some PPA-like location).
If I was a debhelper maintainer, I wouldn't want to merge a Meson
Buildsystem class whose author hadn't prototyped it like this first.
