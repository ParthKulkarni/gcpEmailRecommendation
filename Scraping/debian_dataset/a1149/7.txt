Do you plan to use the aolserver4 name for that package?
If it's a straight replacement under the same name, I can see the
advantage in keeping the existing package around while you prepare
that replacement; feel free to close the proposed-removal bug #891633
(or leave it open to make sure aolserver4 isn't in buster if the
replacement isn't ready, whichever you prefer).
If it's going to be under a different name anyway, then there's probably
little value in keeping the aolserver4 package alive in the meantime,
since the new name would have to go through NEW either way.
