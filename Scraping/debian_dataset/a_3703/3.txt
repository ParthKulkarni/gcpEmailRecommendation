The patches appear to be one new ACPI match[0] and some changes to some
debug messages[1] (marked with a ".optional" suffix, so probably not
really needed). Forking the kernel packages for those trivial changes
is _way_ overkill for a first response. If those patches had been
submitted them upstream then I would expect them to be quickly and
easily merged into the relevant maintainer tree and thus be elligible
for application to the Debian kernels.
I don't know if the kernel config changes/requirements in [2] are
complete but if they are then they seem equally trivial and certainly
worth of a discussion with the Debian kernel maintainers before
deciding to fork.
Even simple forks are deceptively hard to back away from so avoiding
forking for trival reasons is usually a good default, or else you could
easily find yourself stuck with it for an extended period of time.
Googling around suggests that Cherry Trail is supported in mainline
Linux today, with some last issues having been resolved in 4.11 (see
e.g. [3]).
