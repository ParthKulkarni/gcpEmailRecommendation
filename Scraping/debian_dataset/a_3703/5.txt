Thank you for asking and for paying attention to the needs of your
users.
This seems like a good approach to me.
One thing you don't explicitly say is how you will distribute the
source code for your custom kernel.  It's sort of left implicit in
your email.  You absolutely must make available the source code.
(Reading your mail I think you probably know this but I wanted to make
it explicit.)
Best would be to provide both (i) a Debian-format source package (.dsc
et al) in your apt repository, so apt-source works and (ii) your
version control branch (git branch) on some git server.  Mention both
of these in some README that gets installed with the kernel.
Regards,
Ian.
