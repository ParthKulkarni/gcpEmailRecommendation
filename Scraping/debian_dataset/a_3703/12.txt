Thanks for the idea. The reason we don't prefer this at the moment is
two-fold:
1. This would lead to "forking" some parts of the kernel source and
having to track them separately.
2. More importantly, we hope that this is a temporary measure, since
we hope that the patches will be eventuall upstreamed and the kernel
configs will also reflect the changes required.
If this becomes a longer term requirement, I will use your idea
though.
Thanks.
Kumar

As usual, this being a 1.3.x release, I haven't even compiled this
kernel yet.  So if it works, you should be doubly impressed.
