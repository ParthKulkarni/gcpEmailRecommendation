Thanks for pointing this out. Indeed, I would agree that this is the
case. However, the current timeline doesn't permit me to wait for this
process to happen, though I'll try to do it in parallel. My
expectation is that the fork will be short lived, and eventually, the
repository will provide a transition to the general Debian kernel and
be removed soon. However, I'll try my best to avoid it in the first
place, if time permits.
