Hello,
our policy has always been to only add an entry for an
armhf/arm64 system to the flash-kernel database if this entry
works out of the box with the default mainline u-boot
configuration for the respective device.  Users usually expect
that a system boots out of the box without having to build a
non-standard u-boot configuration and modify the default
environment if the system is listed in the flash-kernel machine
db.
I'm open to arguments to the contrary, but for now I believe that
is makes sense to keep this policy.
Having to build u-boot with an undocumented non-standard
configuration and having to modify various non-obvious parts of
the default environment (which possibly includes having to find
out the platform-specific kernel_addr_r, fdt_addr_r and
ramdisk_addr_r values for systems where they are not already
defined in the default environment) to make the system boot is an
extremely high and completely unexpected hurdle for a "normal"
user, and I believe that we would do a large part of our userbase
a misservice by including entries that do not work out of the
box.
For somebody who has the knowledge to perform all the
aforementioned steps on the u-boot side, it's usually easy to
also add a corresponding local entry to /etc/flash-kernel/db.
I'm CCing debian-arm for further opinions on the matter.
Regards,
Karsten
