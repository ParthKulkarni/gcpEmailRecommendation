debian-installer is effectively an embedded OS for the purpose of
installing Debian -- trying to squeeze the ability to build ZFS into
that is a mistake IMO.
Given that you are assuming systems with a decent chunk of RAM, I'd
suggest that you instead boot from live media, thus getting a full
Debian system immediately, running in RAM, without the need to be
restrained by the limitations of debian-installer.
Then you ought to be able to simply install the zfs tools and modules
into the in-RAM system (assuming one can load them without reboot),
format disks as you require, and then install using e.g. debootstrap,
without needing to worry about what debian-installer can or cannot do.
I would guess that debian-live should be up to the task, but if doesn't
work for some reason, you could also look at grml.
Cheers, Phil.
