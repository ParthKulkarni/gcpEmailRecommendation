I would recommend the second of the following options:
1. Install using the non-free media with "Advanced options" -> "Expert install"
2. Install using the non-free media, then cleanup
#!/bin/sh
apt-get install aptitude
sed -i 's/ non-free//' /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update
aptitude search ?obsolete -F '%p' --disable-columns \
    | apt-get purge
...and the non-free packages should be gone.  And if you don't want
aptitude you can purge that too.  It's faster than an "Advanced
options" -> "Expert install", where I believe it is also possible to
install a system which pulls uniquely from main and contrib.
There are a more reasons to use Debian than just default package
selection... eg: updates policy, minimal sysadmin headaches, smooth
upgrades even from major version to major version, very high quality
packaging standards, etc.  These are pragmatic reasons to prefer
Debian.  In my opinion embracing CDDL constitutes ideological
compromise, because it forbids "mixing" with with GPL--the most
socioally conscious and not neoliberal license.  And if Debian isn't
'pure' enough, there are always these:
