>  Your thoughts?
sid is not a rolling release for the public, it is a development area.
Some users use it as a rolling release to get bleeding edge software,
but in fact they become a developer that way (not meaning DD).
If you think regular development prevents you from staying up to date
during the freeze, install the packages you need from experimental. You
are a developer, after all.
