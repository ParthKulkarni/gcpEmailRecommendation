I am not a member of the release team, but I am involved in recent
changes to some of the tools used for migration from unstable to
testing. Since the previous release, those tools and the QA they rely on
have moved in the opposite direction of what you want and have made the
request stronger to not upload disruptive changes to unstable during the
freeze. Also see the release team's statement on this topic [1]: "It is
usually better to revert the changes in unstable and upload the fix
there.". If you want to make this an option for bullseye (I believe it
is too late to properly implement and test this all now), I propose to
help improve the QA and workflow via testing-proposed-updates, as I have
the impression that the people currently involved in the QA and workflow
(including me) are not interested to work towards your solution themselves.
So to answer your question: yes, using experimental during the freeze
for uploads not intended to be included in the next stable release is
useful.
