The package is orphaned, there's no one who he can ask for permission.  The
guy who used to be the maintainer many years ago can probably give some help
but he hasn't been using it for a long time.

On the other hand, I quite don't see what's the upside of using bochs over
qemu.  Is there anything that bochs can do but qemu can't?
