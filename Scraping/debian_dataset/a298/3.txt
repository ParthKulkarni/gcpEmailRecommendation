Hi Frederic,

You seem to indicate that you need to use IPv4 to access the

Is the real failure you report that it did not configure IPv4 
correctly?
I managed to get the manual setup menus, by changing the priority of 
the
installer, also undoing the IPv6 (if I remember correctly) and so on 
but
wrong, but given the ip output, it seems it was in the middle of an 
IPv6
the thing is that you received an IP allocation from the IPv6 router on 
your subnet. That it's 6to4 makes me suspicious that it's a 
misconfigured ancient Windows Server with ICS on the same subnet. Is 
that possible?
We're kind of in a bound here in terms of IPv6: We have received IP 
addressing and routing but we're not allowed to call home to our servers 
to check if actual connectivity exists. So we assume that given that one 
autoconfiguration mechanism exists and succeeded that we don't have to 
prompt for the other protocol. (The same would happen for IPv4 if there 
would be a malicious IPv4 DHCP server and static IPv6-only 
connectivity.)
I'd somewhat argue that you need to keep your network sane or resort to 
manual configuration as you did. But it's likely that the latter needs 
some better documentation, so if you can point at what's missing where, 
we can add it. :)
It can be either if you're dual-stacked. If you don't receive an IPv6 
announcement nor IPv4 DHCP you're prompted for static configuration and 
you're unlikely to use another protocol in the nameserver prompt. I 
suppose it said "IPv6 autoconfiguration succeeded" somewhere in the 
process, but only very briefly. :/
default via fe80::4e96:14ff:fe59:d7f0 dev enP5p1s0f1  metric 1024  
expires 0sec
So 4C:96:14:59:D7:F0 provides broken IPv6 connectivity on the same 
subnet. It provided you with an address out of 9.3.1.95's 6to4 space. If 
it'd route and you'd use a valid IPv6 nameserver, you'd be fine.
However, there's another catch - the one why Windows made so many Linux 
boxes sad in the past and why things like RA Guard matter: the expiry is 
set to 0 sec. So it actually says that you shouldn't really send traffic 
there. And then I suppose that Linux thinks "well, it's better than 
nothing". On the other hand the address it handed out has a lifetime of 
5 months. -_-
Kind regards
