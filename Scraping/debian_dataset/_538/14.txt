Hi all,
(please CC)
is there anything known about the status of ftp-master? I couldn't
find any warning or announcement, but I did upload three packages,
one was rejected and re-uploaded with a fix (for a stupidity in 
lintian), but these three packages *never* got processed. Not
even an answer or whatever email, seems like a dead end where
files have been deleted?
The upload happened 2 days ago, so I gues enough time ...
Norbert
