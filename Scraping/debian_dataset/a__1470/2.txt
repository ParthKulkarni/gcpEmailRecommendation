No, the *[ ... ] syntax means an arbitrary number of the thing in the
brackets.
I've read that some of the IDNA rfcs added i18n for hostnames too which 
resulted in making "_" legal there too but I couldn't find that anywhere
Enabling HTTPProtocolOptions unsafe on the virtualhost doesn't work so 
you need to enable it on the global apache config - and the 
documentation notes it's "strongly cautioned against"
But arguing over the interpretation of different specifications is 
unimportant - as you mentioned underscores are widely in use right now, 
and as Ondrej agreed it's a bad idea to have such a huge breaking change 
whether it's intended or not.
