No, that's a misunderstanding.
"The information I need" is the Debian-specific modifications to the
current upstream source, separated into logically independent patches.
Having separate patches in debian/patches gives me this information very
quickly.
Having to run git log, and then to manually merge the the commits gives
me the same information, but it is not "very quickly".
This is the drawback of the single-debian-patch approach. The fact that
the patches are available in individual Git commits no longer helps
after a few merges.
Best,
