Sorry, i guess it's possible that apt is doing something fancier that i
don't know about, then.
gpgv on its own expects the --keyring files it encounters to be either a
sequence of raw OpenPGP packets that together form a series of OpenPGP
certificates (a.k.a. "a keyring") or GnuPG's "keybox" format.  AFAIK,
gpgv does not accept ascii-armored files for its --keyring argument.
maybe the apt folks can weight in on what's going on with armored
fragments?  If it's converting them before handing them off to gpgv,
maybe you can just count on it to convert the files that aren't in the
fragment directory as well?

agreed, we can expect these folks to get the details right.

bummer, no awk!

I hope you saw my followup using uudecode instead of base64.  However,
it's still awk-dependent. :/
