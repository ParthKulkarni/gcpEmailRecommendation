apt >= 1.4 uses basically the awk snippet (it is slightly more complex
to deal with two or more armor keys in one file, but that is implemented
more for our testcases than a real external requirement) [see apt-key
for implementation details].
Note that you can NOT use files in keybox format in exchange as apt
merges all keyrings into a big one with 'cat' to avoid both a dependency
on gnupg and to avoid running into limits on the amount of keyring files
(gpg has a limit of 40 keyring files in a single invocation â€“ and there
is always the looming threat of having that be 1 one dayâ€¦).
So, as long as you make it so that an armored file has the extension
'asc' and binary (OpenPGP packet) file has 'gpg' apt will do the right
thing with them in the fragment directory just as well as in Signed-By
[in stretch, but Signed-By is a new-in-stretch feature, too].

For the same reason I wouldn't worry too much about people using *.asc
files with binary format contents and vice versa to be honest.
