AFAIK. If it is armored, it must be called .asc, if not it must be
called .gpg. Armored files are supported since 1.4~beta1, that is,
starting with stretch and Ubuntu zesty. GPG might also support
unarmored content in .asc files (at least it does --unarmor with
an unarmored file).
So, the answer is probably yes, but you could try out just
storing everything in .asc files and it might work (but that's
a bit ugly...).
