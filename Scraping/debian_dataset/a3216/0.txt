Hi all,
FWIW I filed #861288 with a wishlist priority as I don't know :-
a. If debian-cd was the correct package to file it under or not
b. I am not sure how to proceed further than that or what's required
to tell/share it's important to have that in the image.

Bapiste, are you saying to first make a partition and then direct the
file there or how ?
Currently the default behavior of reportbug is something like this -
Submit this report on debian-cd (e to edit) [Y|n|a|c|e|i|l|m|p|q|d|t|s|?]? q
Saving a backup of the report at
/tmp/reportbug-debian-cd-backup-20170427-8431-6odlb26d
Bug report written as /tmp/reportbug-debian-cd-20170427-8431-a_vw0dtq
As can be seen quitting puts it in /tmp
So do I do it like this -
$ reportbug installation-report --severity=normal
-o=/dev/sdc2/installation-report.txt
This is when there are two partitions on the usb disk (sdc1 and sdc2)
made by fdisk/cfdisk (one of them) before.
OR label it and get it mounted and then
$ reportbug installation-report --severity=normal
-o=/media/shirish/USB-Brandname/installation-report.txt
If somebody has done the above and documented it somewhere, please share.
