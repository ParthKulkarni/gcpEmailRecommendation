Which upstream? URLs to upstream bug reports would be considered by me as well.
I am happy to talk to them and upstream patches that would be
acceptable to them.
Most build systems to build-time configuration to check if compiler's
default standards version is at least this much, and if not does it
support this much, and in that case it adds flags to force
higher/newer standards version. This sometimes causes integration
issues downstream in the distributions, but that bit is totally within
the realm of the distribution to fix / ignore / work-around as needed.
