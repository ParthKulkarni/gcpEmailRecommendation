Please excuse my ignorance, but which architecture do we still have with
2 GiB address space? The main point of removing s390 was that this was
unsustainable.

Yeah, IBM behavior has been incredibly frustrating here on the System z
side, too. Essentially they end up actively removing support for
anything they don't support anymore.
To some degree I understand this behavior: It's a real relieve to not
need to support something old and crufty when you're the engineer on the
other side having to do that. Even when such support is contributed,
someone needs to keep it working and they won't keep old hardware around
for that.
But it has very awkward implications on the people that still have that
hardware for one reason or another and don't actually rely on a support
contract.
For s390x I can say that the port was driven without any commercial
interest on both Aurelien's and my side.
Kind regards
