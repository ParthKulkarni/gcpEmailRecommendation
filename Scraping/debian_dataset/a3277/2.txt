Oops, my apologies. I think 'aiohttp-swagger' would be the more appropriate name, do you agree? I will then use 'python3-aiohttp-swagger' as the binary package name (since the package will only be targeting Python 3).

The other project is one that has not yet been released under an open-source license, although I have it on good authority that it will be over the coming months. Sorry I can't tell you much more or file at ITP at present, but I will do as soon as I can.
