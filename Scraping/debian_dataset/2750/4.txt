Why not? What does it cost you, other than a few bits on your hard disk,
to have those things installed?
It is an actual cost for users who do not (want to) understand the
technical background in why their iSomething doesn't communicate with
Debian properly, and it costs *us* time in support questions if we have
to explain to them that they just need to install this one little thing
here that takes a few MB (if that; haven't checked).
My laptop, which has a 240G SSD, is mostly full. That is, however, *not*
because of the amount of software that's installed; 90% of that storage
is in my /home.
I suspect that the same is true for most users, and therefore that we
just shouldn't care about it.
