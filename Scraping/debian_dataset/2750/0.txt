	As I’ve said before, having libgpgme11 installed enables me to

	that package.  If you know of a way to install the latter without
	also installing the former – I’d appreciate if you’d share.

	installing gnupg, which is via the equivs package.)

	Or not; it’s perfectly sensible to install libmariadbclient18
	on one host and have no MariaDB server running anywhere at your
	site.  It’s something I’ve been doing since before it was called
	‘MariaDB.’
	Similarly for, say, libaudio2: it was quite a while ago that
	I ran nasd(1), but I still have the library installed – simply
	because it allows me to install mpg123.  Or libavahi-client3,
	libdbus-1-3, libpulse0, and probably several other packages
	I cannot recall the names of right noow that I’m not interested
	in running the respective servers for anywhere on my network.

	I beg to differ, per the above.
