I disagree.
There will be users whose reaction to removal of python2.7 will be to compile their own.
Reintroducing /usr/bin/python as a python3 version risks their systems for no benefit (since all python3 stuff points to /usr/bin/python3 and works fine).  Just let it go and don't bring it back.
As far as when to drop it goes, I believe that the python-django maintainers are planning on releasing Buster with Django 1.11 as bilingual python2/python3.  Then they'll go to Django 2, which is python3 only, early in the Bullseye cycle.
For the chunk of the Python ecosystem that is built around Django, keeping python2.7 in for Buster would be a significant aid to transition.
