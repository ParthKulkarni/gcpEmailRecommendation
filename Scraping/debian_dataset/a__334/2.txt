An exception in my experience: In process is cheaper when the
(de)compressor is available in the PerlIO Layer as native C code.
Notable example being libperlio-gzip-perl where you use "open(my $fd,
'<:gzip', $file)".
  At least that was the case when I benchmarked on Lintian in 2.5.10 (2
releases ago).
