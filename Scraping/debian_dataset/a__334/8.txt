Yeah, this is likely it. Thanks for catching that; I'll fix this
codepath shortly.

I don't know whether it does or not; I went looking to see whether you
could trap errors on untie(), and untie doesn't return anything useful
that you can check.

I wouldn't have expected that either, but it appeared to be 4-5 times
slower than the equivalent code with fork a decompressor, which is why I
swapped it out. [I didn't bother to benchmark them, because the
differences between them was so stark.]

Yeah, the -e was inherited, but it has both as you note.
