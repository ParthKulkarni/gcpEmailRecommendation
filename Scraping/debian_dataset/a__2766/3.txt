Ahh, I see.
Geert: to be honest, I overlooked your changing in build.sh.
And now, double-checking that, it works. The header is there in
https://d-i.debian.org/manual/example-preseed.txt
So I have to correct myself a bit: 
The example-pressed.txt file would be ok so far, strictly spoken.
So, the only argument to still change something now, would be:
The whole content of example-preseed.txt is generated from text examples
within the chapter B.4 of the installation-guide.
To be consistent with this, it would require to apply my proposed patch.
It would also give possibility to explain, what this header line is for.
But: Applying my patch would make above's changing in build.sh useless, so
this would have to be reverted, right?
