I do not share your skepticism. We can benefit from imposing some structure 
and there is nothing wrong about exploring options to _improve_ the process 
while not necessarily aiming at solving social problem. What problem by the 
way?
Saying "people are the problem" is too harsh as you are basically giving up 
already, if not worse.
Disagreements are good. In unhealthy environment there may be no 
disagreements because either nobody have opinions to contribute or no guts to 
speak up. Disagreements allow to explore problems from many sides and produce 
deeper understanding.
I'd say let's try the tool and see if it works for us. In process of trying 
we may find some inspirations regardless of the outcome.
