Thanks for the answer! But, unfortunately, this is not related to what
I'm looking for. Your suggestion would work well for an *installed*
system. What we're trying to do is recognize an installation tree and
match it the OS that *will* be installed.
So, what I'm looking for is something like:
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/.treeinfo,
where the .treeinfo would  have something like:
```
[header]
version = 1.0
[release]
name = Debian Stretch
version = 9
[general]
arch = amd64
family = Debian
name = Debian Stretch
version = 9
platforms = amd64
[images-amd64]
kernel = current/images/netboot/debian-installer/amd64/linux
initrd = current/images/netboot/debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz
```
With that, we (as libosinfo) could easily match which Debian version
we're dealing with and, even more, exactly know the location from
where we could fetch the kernel and the initrd in order to perform a
"tree" based installation.
Is it more clear now?
Best Regards,
