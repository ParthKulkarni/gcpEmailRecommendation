You are wrong on your "impression", and I encourage you to verify your
facts before sending mails to the world.
*There is* an authority on the archive: that would be the ftp-masters,
who can one-sidedly decide whether a package can stay in the archive.

I find you attitude in this single email (as well in the others, but I
read with enough attention only this one), very, *very*
counterproductive (en_GB reading), and I urge you to change your tone
if you plan on interacting with the project.
And for you information, it's very rare that once a DD says a package is
no good, a random other DD oversteps the former and goes ahead uploading
it.
