Heh; I should have known that this hack already existed.

I think we'd also need a mechanism for packages/dpkg to track
non-conffile configuration files too.
And we'd still need the above hack when the configuration file should be
disabled on remove even if the admin has only modified the configuration
file.
Maybe we should consider breaking with the past, and moving
configuration files when a package is removed to some staging directory
or tarball, and just restoring them if the package is reinstalled
without an intervening purge. [Or whatever other creative solution the
dpkg developers decide is the best course of action.]
