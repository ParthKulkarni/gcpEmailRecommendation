(I assume you're talking about Pine64 -- PineBook has no GBe, being more a
SoPine than Pine64.)
Works for me fine with the new dmac-sun8i driver -- in fact, achieves a
better speed as the amd64 machine next to it.
The old near-mainline driver, sun8i-emac, gave only ~60% of theoretical
speed but otherwise worked without a hitch (using Icenowy's patchset).
I have no idea about the BSP kernel.
