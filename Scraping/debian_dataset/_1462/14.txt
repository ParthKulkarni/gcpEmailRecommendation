But is that information available in finish-installation.d/90console?

Are you sure that's the case? The code to enable the serial console
for systemd systems is definitely missing. It's there for upstart
and sysvinit but not for systemd. By default, systemd does not start
a serial getty unless you pass console=ttyS0 on the kernel command
line or enable the service explicitly.
Are you getting a serial console enabled by default on a fresh systemd
installation?

Well, I have just adopted this particular script for systemd and effectively
used the same mechanism as for sysvinit and upstart. Would you have preferred
a completely different mechanism?
There is nothing special about sparc64 in this regard.
