Wouldn't this normally be handled by having postfix delay mail delivery
if clamsmtp wasn't operational? So the ordering of postfix/clamsmtp
startup is less important.
Perhaps even better would be to have clamsmtp do socket activation, so
the sockets existed before either postfix or clamsmtp were started.

Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that
you do it.
