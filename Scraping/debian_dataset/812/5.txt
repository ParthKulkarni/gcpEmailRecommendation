Hi Jonas,
This is a very interesting discussion, it's IMO important to have it.

All I'm saying, is that copyright holder information / author list is
mandatory if the license mandates it. The case of an anonymous author
shows we've accepted software in Debian without a copyright holder.

I failed to see the part where the Debian Policy Â§ 12.5 mandates a
copyright holder list. All it mention is "copyright information" which
is more vague than a copyright holder list + license text. Either way
(yours or mine), this needs clarifying in the policy. Such clarification
would help a lot to ask upstream to follow a (clearer) policy, which so
far I of course failed to request because it's a blurred area (see what
Jeremy wrote in this thread).

I still don't understand why. I understand why it's a re-assurance that
the shipped license is correct, but I don't see why otherwise.
