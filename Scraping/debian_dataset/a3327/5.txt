That certainly helps, but it doesn't cover everything since the
mkdir's and ln's could fail. Those are easier to handle by adding -p
and -f, respectively, but that's a subtle change in behavior for ln
relative to the mknod change. In the mknod case, an existing device is
left as is. In the ln case, it would be forcefully overwritten.
It's not a big deal in my case (both OBS and debootstrap setup /dev
properly), but I don't know if that's important to others.
