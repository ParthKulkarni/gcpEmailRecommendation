This reply is going to be annoying, I fear:

I think the answer is "yes, we think that is unacceptable".
ftpmaster seem rarely to reply to these kind of questions.  If you
actually want the answer, I suggest you:
 - search for existing cases and see if they got REJECTed or ACCEPTted
 - upload and see

I don't understand how these are different to the previous question.

I think (and this is my personal opinion) that a licence
incompatibility is a bug in the depending package, and it is the
responsibility of the depending package maintainer.

I'm not aware of any useful tools and I hope someone else will be
able to help.

I guess.  It seems like a lot of work, and the cups transition would
be blocked.
You might instead consider simply filing bugs against the
dependencies, and setting a deadline by which they will be escalated
to RC.  You will want to discuss this with the release team.
Good luck.
Ian.
