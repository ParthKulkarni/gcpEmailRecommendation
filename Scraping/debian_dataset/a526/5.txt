It builds fine here on my machine using sbuild and also fine on the buildds
which are building with sbuild and "parallel=N" with N >= 2 [1].
You are building in an unclean build environment unless you are building with
something like sbuild and pbuilder, so your build results can have unexpected
results.
Please create a local sbuild setup and try again.
