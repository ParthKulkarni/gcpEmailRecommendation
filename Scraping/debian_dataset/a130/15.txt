One thing that has not been answered yet in this discussion (and if the
TC is to make a decision about it, I think it should be) is "why are we
doing this". That is, what is the problem that usrmerge is meant to
solve, and how does it attempt to solve it? As far as I know, the reason
usrmerge exists is so that no files will be installed in /bin anymore;
but that seems like an XY problem.
Also, I would like to ask why the traditional solution in Debian -- make
a policy change that says no package can ship anything in /bin except
for a compatibility symlink, and make that rule RC at some point in the
future -- is not being considered. That seems like a solution that would
cause far less pain than what we're going through right now.
