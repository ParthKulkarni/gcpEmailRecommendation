There were discussions about enabling this by default years ago, I
don't think minor issues should be a reason to delay this change.
Note that it has been delayed for after the stretch release as there
were major issues back then (it was enabled by default for a short time
in stretch).  It took >5 months for someone to find a problem this time
which is pretty good for any change.
