The before/after comparison for Debian and Ubuntu is apples and oranges.  
Before Ubuntu had the auto package test migration there we nothing other than 
installability blocking migration, it had (and still doesn't AFAIK) any notion 
of blocking due to RC bugs.
Back to my experience with postfix: I don't recall the auto package test 
catching anything.  When I upload it broken to unstable (and via autosync to 
the Ubuntu devel release) people notice pretty much right away.
I'm sure it's generally helped, but so far, I've found it mostly a nuisance.  
If Debian started enforcing auto package test pass for Testing migration, the 
first thing I'd do is remove the postfix tests (it's never worked on Debian as 
far as I've noticed, despite intermittently working on Ubuntu, and I've no 
idea why).  Postfix doesn't have rdepends, so at least for that package, I can 
side step the problem.
