No, that won't work at all. If you upload libfoo which regresses a reverse
dependency bar and bar's tests now fail, then removing libfoo's autopkgtests
won't help you *at all* in landing the new libfoo in testing. You'd need to
convince bar's maintainer to change/drop the test.
The carrot for adding tests is that the better they are, the harder you make it
for *other people* (i. e. your dependencies) to break your software. The stick
is that you then of course need to make/keep your own tests running so that you
can upload new versions of libfoo yourself.
So IMHO the incentives are quite right here.
Martin
