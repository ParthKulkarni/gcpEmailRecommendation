So I pushed and uploaded pkgsel 0.46 for #875858. For the remaining four
bugs, I have nothing against a review but I hope it does not end up
being stalled because nobody wants to review those changes. It's not clear
to me who is that person. In the iso-scan changelog, you are the last
non-translation committer and before that it was Otavio Salvador/Colin
Watson in 2012... in the hd-media image definition, many people committed
fixes for changes to udeb but I see no clear owner of that image either.
Colin, could you review the patches I sent in the above bug reports and
let me know if you think they are suitable to be committed ? You made
similar changes to mine in debian-installer-utils and you have a broad
knowledge of debian-installer.
Thank you in advance.
PS: Cyril, can you point me to the earlier attempts for these features?
Maybe I can double check that I did not fall in the problems that were
spotted earlier...
