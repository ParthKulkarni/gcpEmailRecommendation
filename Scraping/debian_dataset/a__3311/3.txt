FWIW, this sort of strongly-worded but non-specific remark isn't
particularly helpful to other reviewers (or indeed to the patch
submitter, since it seems that they weren't the same person as was
working on similar features last time round); it leaves us with the
vague notion that something might be wrong, but no clue as to what.  If
you know more about the history of these features it would be good to
give us slightly more in the way of details.

I've left a few UX and code review comments in #868848, #868859, and
#868900.  Without having tried actually running them or anything, they
seem reasonable to me otherwise.
I don't see anything wrong with #868852, but I haven't done much with
image building for some years so I don't know if there are any size
concerns or whatever.  If that's not an issue then it's probably fine.
