So, where is the benefit compared to the way, giving translators commit access
themself?
Of course, we limit access to the git repo, which can be considered as a pro.
But to achieve that, we need more manpower for doing the "accept pull requests"
jobs, that's the contra site.
Since manpower is always an issue on platforms like Debian, I would vote for
the "give translators commit access" way :-)
