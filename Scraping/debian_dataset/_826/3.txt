Dear all,
I had read https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/04/msg00006.html
so knew when the transition freeze is going to happen. For a blog
post/technical article I wanted to share about the transition freeze
and went to https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/ as well as
https://bits.debian.org/ but neither seems to have that info.
Shouldn't be the milestone including perhaps info. on tentative alpha
releases be put somewhere or are the dates subject to change ?
If the dates are locked down, it would be nicer to be able to
share/link to an official page on debian website rather than just an
e-mail.
Looking for info.
