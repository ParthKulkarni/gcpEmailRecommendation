Thank you for the suggestions.
I've tried adding "debug", removing "quiet", and adding "nomodeset".
Is that what you're referring to?  I just tried using netconsole, but
the system doesn't have an RJ45 jack, the Wi-Fi adapter requires
firmware, and the wireless network requires a password, so something
in there caused it not to work.  :(

I was able to get the system to boot by installing LILO instead of
GRUB.  Do you have any suggestions for investigating why GRUB doesn't
work?
