We're talking about /var/log/installer being missing? That would be a
first for me for an installation when the “Installation complete” screen
is displayed (that's shown by finish-install).

If there are really no logs after installation, maybe you could redo the
installation, check what's in /target/var/log/installer when that screen
is displayed, and save dmesg/syslog before rebooting?
Good luck.
