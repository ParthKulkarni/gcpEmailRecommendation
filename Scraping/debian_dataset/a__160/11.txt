tiny node packages are being accepted all the time, but you're still expected to
follow policy and do your job as a maintainer - otherwise, things will get rejected.
If you took a couple of minutes to write a proper package description that
wasn't "some package needs it", then your package would get accepted (assuming
there are no other problems) and everyone would be happy. And you would get less
complains on debian-devel@ to your ITPs as well.
It doesn't matter that your package is small and that users won't normally
install it directly. It's still mandated that it includes a description, and
ftpmasters are only doing their job.
Cheers,
Emilio
PS: many thanks to the ftpmaster for doing a (so often) thankless job!
