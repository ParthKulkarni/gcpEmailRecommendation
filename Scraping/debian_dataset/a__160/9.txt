That presumably makes sense to people that know what node is.
I'm somewhat aware what it means, having pondered quite a lot of these
ITPs, but it is pretty close to nonsense.
Someone that does not know what node is needs to decide if that should
be read to mean one of:
  tty module from [node core for browsers]
or
  tty module from node core, for browsers
or perhaps something else.
Having done that, they then need to wonder what a tty module might be.
Then again, they could try looking at the code, which astonishingly does
nothing other than throw errors about how none of this is implemented,
except in the case of the one function that does anything ('isatty')
which unconditionally returns false.
That being the case, one might have hoped for a description saying
something like:
  stub version of tty, to (barely) satisfy browserify's dependencies
The description that you are attempting to defend has been lifted,
unedited, from the github repository.
I'd suggest that it was already misleading to the audience that it was
aimed at, which is not the audience it is now being misapropriated for.
Cheers, Phil.
