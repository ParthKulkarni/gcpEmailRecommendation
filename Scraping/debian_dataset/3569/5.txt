I recently got this really neat hack from a Debian Developer
Balasankar's .gitlab-ci.yml file.
As I can see you have got an answer in the thread. just FYI, this is
another way to do it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- export BUILD_DEPENDS=`perl -ne 'next if /^#/;
$p=(s/^Build-Depends:\s*/ / or (/^ / and $p)); s/,|\n|\([^)]+\)//mg;
print if $p' < debian/control`
- apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends$BUILD_DEPENDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first is a neat perl hack to get the build-depends from the control
file, and the second line installs them nicely.
