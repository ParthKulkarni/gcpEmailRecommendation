Hi,
 I've imported some git repo to salsa and tried to use its CI via
 debian/.gitlab-ci.yml. As a harness, I want just get build dependency
 packages and build source. Then, what's the simple way to get it?
 "apt-get build-dep" depends on uploaded package, not source in repo,
 so it'd fail if its dependency would be changed. Using dpkg-scanpackages
 is bit tough to parse output.
 Any suggestions?
