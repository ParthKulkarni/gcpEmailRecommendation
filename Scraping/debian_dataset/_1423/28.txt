True.  But I still think it would be a good idea for unreleased
binaries to show up as such in the dpkg database.

(Of course such things should not end up signed, but, this point is
well-made.)
How about the following, which provides more flexibility for what
individual users want:
 * Unfinalised changeslogs should contain UNRELEASED in either
   the suite name or the version number.  (Currently there is
   no consensus about this.)
 * Where the suite contains UNRELEASED, it SHOULD NOT be simply
   `UNRELEASED'.   It should be `unstable-UNRELEASED' or
   `experimental-UNRELEASED' or such.
 * Tools which generates .changes files (specifically,
   dpkg-genchanges) should, if they find that the version contains
   UNRELEASED and the suite does not, append UNRELEASED to the suite.
   (This is to help save downstreams etc.)
 * The Debian archive will be taught to reject anything with a version
   containing UNRELEASED (as I proposed before).

Yes.

Yes, they should.

(`dgit push' already (thinks it) knows the answer to this question and
could insert the right information.)
I don't think debsign is the right place.
If the suite name is not globally unique, then the full qualification
should be in the changelog.  Ie, the changelog should contain the
intended target archive.
