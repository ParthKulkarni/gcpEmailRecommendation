The final line of a finalised changelog indicates who signed off on the
package: the person who said "it's time to upload this".
I think that we should continue to record the person who made that
judgement.  Someone who made a small change and whose name appears [in
square brackets ] shouldn't automatically have responsibility for the
whole upload -- but *someone* should have that overarching
responsibility.
