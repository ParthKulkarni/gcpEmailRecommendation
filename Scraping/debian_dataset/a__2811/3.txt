Thanks a lot for that patch. I have applied it to apache2 2.4.25-3+deb9u6, compiled apache2 using dpkg-buildpackage, and installed apache2-bin package on production webserver. So far no issues.
But I cannot tell you if it improved anything. The thing is, I couldn't reproduce the previous issue under desktop Safari right before patching Apache. I tried hard to reproduce it the same way I was able to reproduce it on Dec 14th. I switched back the relevant sites to HTTP/2 (Protocols h2 http/1.1) and tested in Safari checking web inspector console on a site where previously a bunch of jpg images were not loaded at all.
So, it seems that magically, the problem went away by itself. Could the original issue be related to any load / buffer issues on long running apache??
I am sorry that I cannot give you any more detailed feedback. It works fine with your patch as it did before...
Can you explain why this issue only occurred in Safari? If I check the mod_h2 Github issues and threads referenced in upstream changelog, there is no hint about this being related to Safari:
  *) mod_http2: adding defensive code for stream EOS handling, in case the request handler
     missed to signal it the normal way (eos buckets). Addresses github issues 
     https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/164, https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/167
     and https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/170. [Stefan Eissing]
