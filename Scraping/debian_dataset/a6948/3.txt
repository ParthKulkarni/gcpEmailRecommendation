As just a little color into what the autopkgtest for "debuerreotype" does,
it uses snapshot.debian.org to create a point-in-time reproducible snapshot
of Debian Stretch from 2017-01-01T00:00:00Z (
http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20170101T000000Z/).
I've managed to reproduce the change locally for testing vs unstable, and
"diffoscope" provides the the following insight:

So it looks like some recent change in "debootstrap" has either started
removing "run/mount/" or has changed whatever was triggering it to be
created?
