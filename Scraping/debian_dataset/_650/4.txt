It's still main, just unreleased/main rather than unstable/main. It may not be
ideal, but 1. it has no effect on release architectures 2. the one-off change
means porters don't have to keep a fork of debian-installer updated, which is
effectively how it is now, and that's clearly not working out very well either
given the lack of installer images for most ports. I've re-Cc'ed
debian-ports-devel; perhaps others have ideas for how to resolve this.
