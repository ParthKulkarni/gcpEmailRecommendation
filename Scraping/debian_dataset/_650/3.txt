Some data points:
alpha          : Missing srm-reader in archive. Builds after adding a
                 locally-built .udeb to localudebs (and working around the
                 crazy broken mirror setup on electro [one of the local mirrors
                 has no unstable -> sid symlink, but has an unreleased -> sid
                 symlink]*...  but that's not debian-installer's problem). If
                 alpha porters want installer images, I guess they should
                 upload and maintain srm-reader in unreleased.
hppa           : Builds after applying patch from #852260.
hurd-i386      : Builds without any further changes.
kfreebsd-amd64 : Builds if the netboot gtk image size limit is increased by 2M.
sparc64        : Builds without any further changes.
These were all done in chroots with just the build-deps installed. None of the
build results have been tested.

* This would not be a problem for http mirrors, since debian-installer would
  discard the mirror as invalid when generating the udeb sources.list, but
  since this is a file: mirror, it doesn't check for validity and assumes it
  works. In theory debian-installer could check file: mirrors too, which would
  work around this insanity.
