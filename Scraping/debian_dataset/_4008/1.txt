Do you mean the name "s"?  "short" was the primary intent here, since
this serves as an alias; making it longer would defeat the purpose.  I
intended 's' to stand for "secure" (and "seed").
Do you have an alternate suggestion that you consider more evocative of
its purpose, without defeating that purpose?
