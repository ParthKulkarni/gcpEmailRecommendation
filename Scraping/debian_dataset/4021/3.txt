There is a misunderstanding here and also in this thread. The Raspberry Pi has
the VC4 GPU which is hardware accelerated Desktop OpenGL 2.1 via the VC4 Mesa
driver.[1] This driver is fully open-source unlike the binary blob it comes with
that only supports GLESv2, but not via X11 nor Wayland.
So the only way to support Qt with hardware (not software) accelerated GL on
the RPi is with the VC4 mesa driver and Desktop GL.
As for OpenMW running on a RPi, it is fully hardware (GPU) accelerated via the
VC4 driver. It runs pretty darn well. You can walk around Morrowind (with mods)
right now at 25fps @ 1080p using a GPU-based VC4[1] OpenGL 2.0 renderer.
60fps in interiors. This is on a Raspberry Pi 2, likely better with the
RPi3 with VC4 being EoL, the next iteration of the RPi will likely be VC5/6
that is arm64.

There are more than 5 million Raspberry Pis were sold as of February 2015. All
of them with a VC4 GPU, Raspbian ships with the VC4 mesa driver enabled!
I'm of the opinion that the switch away from Desktop OpenGL to GLES was a huge
mistake and should be reversed as soon as possible unless there is a way to
provide for both on all archtictures.
