To play devil's advocate, isn't this just a more explicit summary of how 
security support works in debian generally? When a package gets to be to 
hard to maintain, it just stops getting security updates. When an 
architecture gets to be too much cost for the benefit of updating, it 
doesn't get LTS. I don't see how the fact that some people are paying 
directly changes anything; there are already debian developers who get 
paid for doing debian work, and it's not as though the people who are 
purely volunteers can be made to work on anything in particular any more 
than the people who are getting paychecks. As long as the packages which 
come out of this are available for everyone I think it's a net win for 
the community and a reasonable use of debian resources. If someone wants 
more packages supported they could always pay for it or do the work, 
right?
