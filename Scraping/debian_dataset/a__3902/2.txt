It would be better than running 'env' to test a single variable value,
but it is still not right to assume that the container environment
variable is inherited.  In fact, I checked with 'systemd-nspawn -B' and
it was not inherited by a login shell.
As I commented on the merge request, reading /run/systemd/container (if
present) and then pid 1's environment seems like it will be the most
reliable approach.
