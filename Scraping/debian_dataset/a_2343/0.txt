downgrade with "apt-get install packagename=version". Sadly this does 
not seem to resolve dependencies, and you may also need many 
dependency=version arguments. Many many. You could construct this from 
your log using regular expressions.
I always run "apt-get dist-upgrade -V -s" before dist-upgrade. This 
morning I neglected to notice that dist-upgrade was removing qpdfview 
and its dependencies, so I feel your pain. Fortunately I use XFCE so the 
damage was limited. sid is for people who pay attention.
One thing I miss from Fedora is yum history, which allows any update 
transaction to be rolled back. I found the Debian process to be tedious 
and error-prone. I would be delighted if anyone has a better suggestion.
Kind regards,
