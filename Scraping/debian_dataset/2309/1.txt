Yes. You nicely summarized it. Seafile for example has from/to versioned update 
scripts. And an update between several releases is easy: You just run all the 
update scripts in between. Owncloud didnÂ´t provide for this and David PrÃ©vot  
back then put a lot of work around it, only to be accused of irresponsible by 
 Jos Poortvliet.

Yes, and thats a principal mind gap between many web application developers 
and Debian.
I concur with your preference here. I donÂ´t want to upgrade to major new 
software versions all three month. Thus I plan to install Seafile instead, but 
AFAIK there are only Seafile client packages ready for Debian. IÂ´d love to see 
official Debian packages for the server component, but currently see myself 
putting time into this.

Fairly enough this was with Owncloud upstreamâ€¦ and more than a year ago. I 
believe many Owncloud developers moved on to Nextcloudâ€¦ so I belief Nextcloud 
upstream consists of mostly the same peopleâ€¦ I never really confirmed that 
belief, beyond anecdotical statements I read in several blog posts.
