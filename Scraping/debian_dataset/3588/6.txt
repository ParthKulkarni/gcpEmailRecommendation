It's amazing how my email seems to have been understood differs from
what I wanted to say. I thought it was clear from the "not
maintainable" part that I did not suggest we use minified source as
source code. I was merely pointing out that it technically still was
source code in the sense that the same compiler/interpreter yields the
same result with the minified code as with the original one.
For all practical manners this is irrelevant.

I absolutely agree with you that it does not work with our current way
of packaging, but that's what this discussion about. IMO it would be
great if we found a way to offer these applications to our users.
