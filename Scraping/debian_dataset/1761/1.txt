Thanks for the pointer. Just out of curiosity, do you intend on using
the blends framework for the pkg-security team?

Reading the description of wifiphisher, it looks awfully easy to steal
important credentials from anyone who is connected to any wifi,
including most "secured" connections, not to mention airport hotspots.
If you have pointers about those best security practices, I'll gladly
take them.
Quickly Googling "pkg-security" and "Debian security" did not reveal a
prominent central place for this sort of information. Although not
Debian-specific, a starting point at debian.org for raising awareness
for our users would be nice. If the pkg-security team could take it on
its shoulders...
Kind regards, Thibaut.
