This is a tool that is shipped in Kali Linux, a Debian derivative and we
are trying to merge back packages useful for penetration testers into
Debian. The benefit is clear for that category of users.

Given that this is mainly "social engineering", the best way to protect
users is to teach them about what can be done securely or not. I'm afraid
that this answer won't satisfy you but the job of the penetration tester
is to point out when some users do not follow best security practices
or when the current practices are just not secure enough.
