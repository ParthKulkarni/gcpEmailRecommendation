We should certainly continue to align package relations with Debian 
Policy - and therefore by extension continue to argue about that as 
necessary to evolve Debian Policy:
Upstream (or other) package relation hints can be a valuable _aid_ in 
resolving Debian package relations, but only that: An aid!
Debian packaging follows Debian Policy - other hints do not.
