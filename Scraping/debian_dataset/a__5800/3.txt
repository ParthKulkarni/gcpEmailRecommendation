Yes. I started a debian "reinstall" on a wheezy installation on the
QNAP, by running the kirkwood-qnap to detect the kernel version.
I don't recall getting an error, it just does:
echo "kirkwood-qnap: Unable to determine $machine variant " >&2
exit 1
So, I figured the model in cpuinfo (Feroceon 88FR131 rev 1 (v5l)) was
less important for the kernel version than
/sys/bus/soc/devices/soc0/soc_id and lscpi output and picked kernel-6282.
Then I flashed new kernel-6282 and initrd:
cat $kernel > /dev/mtdblock1
cat initrd > /dev/mtdblock2
I didn't change uboot.
Then I rebooted and got the stretch installer, and I tries install the
system at least 10 times trying to rule out that anything I did along
the way was a problem (like change DNS manually) ... but it kept
segfaulting at the same point consistenly.
I ran the tests on wheezy before flashing the installer for reinstall. I
could probably get back to the wheezy system (somehow, maybe using
TFTP). As of now I've left the system in this stretch-half-installed
state if there's need for debugging.
