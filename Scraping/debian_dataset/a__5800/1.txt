I received one other report about a segfault on QNAP (when running
anna) a few months ago.  (This was in private mail and wasn't reported
to debian-boot even though I recommened it.)
Unfortunately, I don't really know what's going on.

Maybe the QNAP firmware has changed.  If you can easily go back to the
QNAP firmware, we can look into this issue.
