That isn't actually what I said. As an upstream name, in context,
Recipes is fine. In an OS distribution that isn't particularly GNOME-centric,
it isn't. Mapping between the two is part of the OS distributor job.
Analogous: we call GNU Make "make" because we're a GNU/Linux
distribution[1], so the assumption should be that things with a GNU
version are the GNU version unless otherwise stated. The BSDs call it
"gmake", short for GNU Make, because they are not primarily GNU
distributions.
Similarly, I wouldn't be surprised if a more GNOME-centric OS distribution
like Fedora was happy to release recipes-*.rpm, but in Debian it should
be gnome-recipes_*.{dsc,deb}.
If upstream don't want to rename it, combining a renamed source
and binary package with ./configure --program-prefix=gnome-
and some trivial patches to desktop files and D-Bus and/or systemd
services should be reasonably straightforward.
