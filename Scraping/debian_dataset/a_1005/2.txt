I think this is too generic. The upstream name is Recipes, and that name is
fine within the context of GNOME (particularly when its machine-readable
name is actually org.gnome.Recipes), but within Debian/Ubuntu it would
seem more reasonable to call it gnome-recipes.
(Alternatively, you could consider packaging it as org.gnome.recipes?
But that's probably too unconventional within Debian.)
My usual rule of thumb is that non-indicative "brand names" like Evince,
Nautilus and Leafpad are fine without a prefix, but generic names like
(GNOME) Builder, (GNOME) Terminal and (lx)launcher need a namespace prefix.
