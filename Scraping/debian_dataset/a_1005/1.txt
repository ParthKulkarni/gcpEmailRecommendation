The rename is done. The upstream project is still named 'recipes' but
the binary and data directories are named gnome-recipes. The Debian
source and binary package are named gnome-recipes too.
Force-pushed since it's a new repo and I didn't know how to make
gbp/pristine-tar handle the rename:

Thanks,
