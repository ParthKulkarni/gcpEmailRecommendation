Interesting, but not ready for prime time yet, AFAIU.

Interesting, kinda :-/
Note that the OpenRISC isn't my main interest here, even if I mentioned
jor1k.
Simulating any other architecture may fit, as my purpose, so far would
be to try and run a Debian system inside the browser... and the
underlying CPU / simulator wouldn't matter much.
Jor1k is simulating an OpenRISC, but I don't mind trying with x86 ala
http://bellard.org/jslinux/.

Hmmm that lacks details if no one knows all the fancy names in
advance... but I might as well check and complement the page ;)
Thanks a lot.
Best regards,
P.S.: enjoyed Hacker noir ep. 1 ;)
