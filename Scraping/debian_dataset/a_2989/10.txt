Hi,
sorry, I've spotted this very late - may be it is helpful anyway.

Why do you think upload_history would be incomplete.
I wonder whether this query might be helpful.  It sorts the Debian
packages according to date in upload_history - you can draw your cutting
line wherever you want.
export PGPASSWORD="public-udd-mirror"
SERVICE="--host=public-udd-mirror.xvm.mit.edu --username=public-udd-mirror udd"
psql $SERVICE >packages_sort_by_age.txt <<EOT
    SELECT u.source, u.version, cast(u.date as date) AS date, s.release, u.maintainer_name, u.changed_by_name, u.signed_by_name FROM (
     SELECT source, r.release, strip_binary_upload(MAX(version)) AS version,
            row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY source ORDER BY r.sort DESC)
       FROM packages p
       JOIN releases r ON p.release = r.release
       WHERE (r.sort >= (SELECT sort FROM releases WHERE role = 'stable') OR r.sort = 0) -- 0 for experimental
       GROUP BY source, r.release, r.sort
     ) s
     JOIN upload_history u ON s.source = u.source AND s.version = u.version
     WHERE row_number = 1
     ORDER BY date, source
  ;
EOT
May be you want to drop all non-sid releases since they might be
irrelevant. 
Hope this helps
        Andreas.
