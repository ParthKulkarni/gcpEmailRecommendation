Given that we forgot to mention this issue at least once, I would like
to create a bug in the BTS for it.
This would have the advantages of being a good place to store the
latest status as well as being a convenient way to link others to it. 
I'd be happy to summarise the replies to the thread thus far, please
just let me know which package I should assign it to (general?
buildd.debian.org? I'm easy...)
Regards,
