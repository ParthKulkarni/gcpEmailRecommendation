hehe, very nice. 
Just the numbers strike me as odd: we currently have 28043 source
packages in sid/main (according to our stats on tests.r-b.o), soâ€¦
sid  debian-work:/var/lib/apt/lists$ grep -c ^Package: deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_source_Sources
33168
sid  debian-work:/var/lib/apt/lists$ grep ^Package: deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_source_Sources|sort -u|wc -l
  28049  
ah, ok, that explains, you counted some packages twice.
an then I was curious how big contrib and non-free were:
sid  debian-work:/var/lib/apt/lists$ grep ^Package: deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_contrib_source_Sources | sort -u |wc -l
    156
sid  debian-work:/var/lib/apt/lists$ grep ^Package: deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_non-free_source_Sources | sort -u |wc -l
    325
So in other words a bit less than 33% of the archive still needs a rebuild.
