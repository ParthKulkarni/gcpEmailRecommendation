Do you use di-netboot-assistant [1] or just the debian-installer netboot
packages/images [2]?

In di-netboot-assistant, a grub-EFI image is prepared which then
includes the grub.conf files of the debian-installer images, with the
correct paths.  You get an idea in [3].  Perhaps you can follow this
approach (or even better: use di-netboot-assistant) too.
On the other hand, if you are already talking about a problem with
di-netboot-assistant, we should open a bug against
di-netboot-assistant and take a closer look at what went wrong.  I
only tested the grub-EFI stuff in di-netboot-assistant within a
virtual machine setup, as I currently have no EFI system around.
Best regards,
