Just the netboot.tar.gz images.

Thanks a lot, I was not aware of grub-mknetdir (and di-netboot-assistant's menu building) so far.
OTOH, this still not answers the question if any functionality using paths relative to the
bootnetx64.efi is available in grub.
Should I open a bug report against grub or do you have another idea ?
Thanks a lot,
 greetings
