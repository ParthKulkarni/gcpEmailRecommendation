Hi everybody,
I plan to move di-netboot-assistant's directory within the TFTP-root.
Right now, '$TFTP_ROOT/debian-installer/' is used to set up and serve
the netboot-images.  If you also serve preseedings from the canonical
location '$TFTP_ROOT/d-i/', you have a slightly confusing setup.
The plan is to use 'd-i/n-a/' for di-netboot-assistant, to have all
installer stuff within the common '$TFTP_ROOT/d-i/' directory.
Any objections to move in that direction?
Best Regards,
  Andi
