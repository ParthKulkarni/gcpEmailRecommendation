yes, yes, yes. I remember this conversation starting and fading every                                                                                                                                                                                          
year or so (maybe each release cycle?. It doesn't matter)
I'd put a note that discourages people from increasing the severity of                                                                                                                                                                                       
a bug to RC and then take over the package maintenance
I'd go even further and require a specific workflow to be followed or a                                                                                                                                                                                        
choice between 2-3 workflows. (e.g. don't switch d/rules to cdbs, use
copied from QA/MIA process 
(https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/MIATeam).
I know that I am someone who also lacks time quite often. But still, 
this kills a lot of velocity and I wonder how many people will be 
motivated enough to follow up through a whole month of waiting. On the 
other hand if that gives you a blanket "it's now yours, do with it as 
you see fit, including taking over ownership", maybe that's not so 
bad.
(There's of course also the question of VAC notices to crawl, though. 
he won't be around for a year and that people should not take over 
his packages.
If someone went away for a longer period of time with an intent to 
come back, it should be fair game to fix the package and own related 
breakage but obviously not to just hijack it away from the original 
maintainer.)
Besides the thread, are you aware of anything written down somewhere?
