I don't have an opinion on whether this should be done on Debian
servers or not, but I have a comment on providing security support for
more than a decade. How do you plan to deal with the kernel? Do you
expect to backport security fixes to the wheezy kernel, or upgrade the
kernel to newer versions from time to time? A newer kernel may be
necessary for hardware support as well. What's your plan on that? In
addition to the kernel, the rest of the plumbing layer may need
upgrades to handle hardware support, security, changes elsewhere.
I wouldn't want to put a device with Linux kernel from the 2.2 era
(2013) on the Internet anymore. I wouldn't want to put a device with
4.15.4 in 2033.
Personally, I don't find backporting kernel and plumbing changes for
over a decade to be a viable approach. I find planning to upgrade
software on the devices is the way to go. On the other hand, I'm no
longer working on things expected to last 25 years, though I did do
that in a previous job.
While I'm sceptical, IÍ„'m not saying that it can't be done, so I'm not
objecting. Instead, I'm asking, what your plans for this are?
