I think the criteria for patch inclusion in CIP and Debian kernels are
very close.  If we align on a base kernel version, CIP may be able to
use the Debian kernel package as an upstream and send its additions
(for new hardware support) to Debian for inclusion.  (I'm not sure how
CIP would handle this technically, since Debian uses a quilt series in
git whereas CIP uses a normal git branch.  But there are ways of
converting from one to the other.)
