Package: debian-installer
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
I have been trying to fully automate installing debian on the SolidRun Clearfog through a preseed file.
However I cannot seem to skip the first two questions:
[!!] Select a language --> English
[!!] Select your location --> United Kingdom
I looked at the sample at https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt
To quote "# Preseeding only locale sets language, country and locale."
So I put the line 
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US
but I still get to see the question after booting with
setenv bootargs "auto file=/hd-media/preseed.cfg"
For reference I have seen this problem with two versions of the debian installer for testing:
http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/installer-armhf/current/images/hd-media/hd-media.tar.gz
https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/buster_di_alpha3/armhf/iso-cd/debian-buster-DI-alpha3-armhf-netinst.iso
and the daily snapshot of today (12/08/2018)
https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/armhf/daily/hd-media/hd-media.tar.gz
https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/daily/arch-latest/armhf/iso-cd/debian-testing-armhf-netinst.iso
Am I just doing it wrong? I have tried examining the output of debconf-get-selections --installer
but I couldn't find something helpful there.
Yours sincerely
Josua Mayer
