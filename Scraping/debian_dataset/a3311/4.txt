I believe that I have addressed all concerns of Colin. I have pushed
the resulting work in the various git repositories. The following source
packages thus have unreleased changes right now:
- iso-scan (the bulk of the work)
- debian-installer-utils (changes to list-devices)
- rescue (avoid duplicate entries with updated list-devices)
- partman-lvm (avoid problem when you try to auto-partition the drive
  containing the LV containing the ISO used by the installer)
- debian-installer (adding the required kernel modules in the hd-media
  images)
Don't hesite to ping me if you have any problem related to one of my
changes.
Cheers,
