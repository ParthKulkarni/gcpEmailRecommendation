So what option is left for us? We have to take their word for it and move forward without inconveniencing them. I don't think -backports ftp masters is going to accept this proposal (from the responses we already received), so I can live with all dependencies in -volatile.
Jftr, we never said anything about dependencies. If it qualifies for
backports, I don't see any reason for not having those deps in backports. We
never questioned that topic. If it qualifies: great. If not, please don't
upload it. 
A package qualifies for backports if: 
- it adds new features
- wasn't available before
- is in testing
- will receive support for the lifetime of the backports suite
so things like npm are perfectly fine for backports. And we never said
anything for libs, even if they are "standalone" (nothing in backports is
using those libs). 
The main problem with gitlab was: from our perspective several hundred
packages only had one uploader (to backports, other suites don't count) and
we wanted to minimize the risk of being alone with hundreds of unmaintained
backports. 
We solved that problem (by getting more people responsible for the backports)
and accepted it.
