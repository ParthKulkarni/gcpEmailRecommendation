Hi,
I intend to push a new version of gatk[1] which contains some large
files.  I imported the new upstream package the usual way.  But if I
want to push I get:
(master) $ LC_ALL=C git push

error: failed to push some refs to 'git@salsa.debian.org:med-team/gatk.git'
I installed git-lfs locally and tried the command above but it seems it
is really needed remotely on Salsa.  Am I missing something or is there
some action needed?
Kind regards
       Andreas.
