Lots of packages hard-code paths at build time. This is often not
considered to be a bug.
Flatpak's approach to this is to use bind-mounts (in a new mount
namespace set up by bubblewrap) so that the "app" (the leaf package,
together with any libraries that are bundled with it) always appears
to be installed in --prefix=/app, which can safely be hard-coded into
binaries that are built as Flatpak apps.
Flatpak apps are normally recompiled from source with --prefix=/app,
but I don't think it's coincidental that /app is the same length as
/usr and can therefore be patched in with a binary editor as a last
resort :-)
