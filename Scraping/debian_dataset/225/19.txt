I wish I could simply dgit push all of these, but our project is not
yet setup to work effectively across many packages for wide-sweeping
clean-ups, since not all of us use same/similar version control
systems and/or all of DDs having git commit access to all the
repositories. And as a follow-on, NMUs generate extra work for
maintainers to re-integrate NMU changes into their VCS.
I hope that this email alone is enough for at least some maintainers
to integrate/schedule this change without the bug overhead, as this is
low priority. Do note some packages may choose to still support
oldstable and/or no-change backports to those releases thus may
require additional changes to accomodate that.
Eventually, yeah, I will either file bugs or NMU packages for this clean-up.
