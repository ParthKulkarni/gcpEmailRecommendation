POSIXLY_CORRECT. Try it yourself:
ls / -l
POSIXLY_CORRECT= ls / -l
See also:
https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/manpages-dev/getopt.3.en.html
Since not every program does option parsing via getopt(3) the
situation is actually a bit more involved in general. There are
the following three possible things that can happen:
 - Programs that either use getopt(3) or manually implement
   POSIXLY_CORRECT will show the same behavior as ls or rmdir:
   use pure POSIX semantics if the option is set and use the
   GNU extension (which mainly boils down to allowing options
   after parameters) if it's not set.
 - Other programs that implement option parsing manually or use
   another library than getopt(3) will only follow pure POSIX
   semantics.
 - Yet other programs that implement option parsing manually or
   use another library than getopt(3) will only follow the GNU
   extension (or at least a variant thereof).
In the case of most programs such as cp, ls, rmdir etc.
getopt(3) is used and the environment variable does have an
effect.
