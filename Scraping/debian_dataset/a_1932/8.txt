Accurate representation of what they contain.  wnorwegian contains a
file «bokmål» which is the word list for the form of Norwegian known as
bokmål.  There's a convenience link between it and bokmaal so that
people without Norwegian keyboard (or without compose keys) can type it
too, but the canonical name is bokmål, not bokmaal.
(I see there's a small bug where the symlink is the wrong way around,
I'll get that fixed.)
å is in latin1, though so fonts should not be a problem in your
particular case.
