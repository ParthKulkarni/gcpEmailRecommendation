	It does indeed seem natural, when it comes to packages providing
	support for a specific language, to use filenames in that same
	language; I’m not going to strongly object to that.  However,
	I’d like to note that other wordlist packages appear to stick to
	English (and ASCII) filenames.  For instance, wfrench uses
	‘french’ (instead of français) and witalian uses ‘italian’
	(instead of italiano.)
	At the same time, were these files intended for mainly ‘machine’
	use, I guess I’d rather prefer them to stick to ISO 639 instead.
	Just like the ‘locale’ system already does.
	I’m still curious, are there any other uses in the archive
	beside the above?

	Yes.
