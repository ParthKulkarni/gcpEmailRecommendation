	What are the use cases for such filenames?
	FWIW, I more than just occasionally use Debian in environments
	with fonts lacking good (as in: ≥ 90%) Unicode, or even BMP,
	coverage.  (Specifically, I’m for the most part interested in
	Latin-1, -3, and Cyrillic characters only.)
	Do you suggest that there’re filenames in Debian packages that
	cannot be rendered in such environments?  If so, that’d
	certainly be a nuisance for me.
