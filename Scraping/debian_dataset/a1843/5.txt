In practice, this is rare, unless the developer doesn't try to run "make
distcheck" before a build (like they really really should).
The way to do this is:
cd $TOPLEVEL
mkdir build-1 build-2
cd build-1
../configure --this
make
make install DESTDIR=../debian/tmp-1
cd ../build-2
../configure --that
make
make install DESTDIR=../debian/tmp-2
(obviously separated out into the different debian/rules targets, but done as
above for clarity)

True.
