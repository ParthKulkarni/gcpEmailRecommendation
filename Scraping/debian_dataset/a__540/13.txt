There is one regression on powerpc/ppc64 (I know, not release architectures)
as a result of changes in the kernel packaging (linux-bootwrapper package)
that I would like to get fixed before the next upload.
I neeed some help from Ben though since I haven't found a suitable solution
yet. Should be a small patch though once I know how to fix it and I try to
get it committed as soon as possible not to block Alpha 4.
