As of now, I uploaded most of the packages with translation updates, and 
some more trivial uploades too.
(There are again a few translation updates pending, but I would not intend
to upload them for the Alpha 4).
There are still some more d-i packages to upload, but I don't want to do that 
myself (at the moment).
So, from my point, I would be ready for Alpha 4 so far :-)
Ah, maybe upload installation-guide?
Would be a good time for that. Also, to get installation-guide back into
testing (has been removed two months ago).
And:
I want to point to one package, on which I had to do some fix-ups today:
bterm-unifont.
Version 1.5 has been uploaded 5 months ago by bubulle, but apparently he
forgot to push the changes to VCS.
I did that today, which meant to revert Kibi's latest changes, set a tag
for 1.5, and re-apply Kibi's changes again for 1.6, to get the whole thing
into a clean state again.
I hope I got it all right.
This just for your information, to explain the backward-forward-dance.
Holger
