-no-pie is how PIE has been disabled in the packages where it was 
required, and this was already nearly finished before dpkg started
with the specs.

The mess is that gcc and dpkg both try to set policy on PIE.
This should be done in one place.
Both gcc and dpkg would be options for being the one place.
gcc also covers the many packages that are not yet properly
passing flags from dpkg to the compiler, and this default
is working fine for 3 months now.
The number of packages requiring -no-pie was so low that I do not
think any support from dpkg is required for dis/enabling PIE when
gcc enables it by default.

This is a very good suggestion.
When PIE works without problems on a port, a porter should request that 
it gets enabled by default for that port in gcc.
When PIE does not work without problems on a port, nothing should 
enable it on that port.
