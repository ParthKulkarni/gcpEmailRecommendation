Some more notes:
- the grub package will need some adaptions in l10nstat (grub is tricky, since 
  the source package is named grub2, but in the tarball it is grub)
- currently there seems to be no upstream repository for eject.
  It still points to https://git.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/eject.git (which
  is Alioth).
  I have already filed a bug on this some days ago ...
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=901714
- When things are running well for some time, I will change the references to 
  "cvs" into "vcs" ...
