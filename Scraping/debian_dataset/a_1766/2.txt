I've done some digging in the mailing list for the original upstream
project and found this thread:
https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/password-store/2017-February/thread.html#2728
Specifically take a look at this message from the author of the original
tool:
https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/password-store/2017-February/002799.html
The fork appears to have happened after that, but wasn't mentioned at
all on the upstream mailing list.
I haven't looked at the changes specifically, so I can't comment on the
issue of code quality at all, but that a relatively new user [1] forks
the entire project immediately after being shot down a bit for a patch
series (where the response was maybe a bit harsh, but not entirely
negative) doesn't instill me with a lot of confidence in the fork,
especially since the author of the fork hasn't mentioned any specific
use case why the changed functionality is needed at all, as far as I
can tell. (And making --help show extensions was something that devs of
the original project were interested in including regardless.)
Just my 2Â¢.
Regards,
Christian
