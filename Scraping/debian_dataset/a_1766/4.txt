  Description     : passh: a pass fork - stores, retrieves, generates, and synchronizes passwords securely.
Pass is a simple password store. This fork changes a few
things while trying to maintain most of it intact,
specially the core idea. I will keep pulling pass commits,
and also pushing my modifications to them.
