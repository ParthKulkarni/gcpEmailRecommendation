It might be less disruptive to add a new field like Subsection; that'd avoid
the need to change any of archive tools -- including ones not used on the
official archive, like reprepro.

Turns out you don't need to mess with dak; it's an one-liner to produce such
a Packages file:
grep-dctrl -FDescription firmware /var/lib/apt/lists/apt.angband.pl:3142_debian_dists_unstable_non-free_binary-amd64_Packages
(Obviously, this should be ÔΩ¢-FSubsection firmwareÔΩ£ or [-FTag use::firmwareÔΩ£
or whatever way you want to mark subsets.)
Then you generate Release and sign it.
Obviously encapsulating such a feature as an option of dak would be
reasonable, but it's in no way dak exclusive.

Apt (and aptitude) should work flawlessly: there's security.debian.org
jessie/updates, and we had non-free/non-us in the past.

Because Section: implies an unique section, while we want the same package
to be present in both non-free and non-free/firmware, I'd suggest
Subsection: or abusing debtags instead.
