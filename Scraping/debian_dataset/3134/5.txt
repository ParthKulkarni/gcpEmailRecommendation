Thank you for linking the bug.
Not speaking to this case specifically, but in general I would try
to convince maintainers with some combination of irrefutable
argument and well-tested patches (combined with a friendly demeanour
and a rhethorical flourish) rather than try and summon the "mob" from
debian-devel if I didn't immediately get my way.  ;)
Best wishes,
