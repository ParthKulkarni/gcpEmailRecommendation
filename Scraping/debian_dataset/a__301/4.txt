This sounds familiar. Maybe it's simply broken in 2.2.22. Can you compare with 
2.2.22-13+deb7u7 if that bug has been there already?
In 2.2.30, there is this fix, which is obviously missing from 2.2.22:
  *) core, modules: Avoid error response/document handling by the core if some
     handler or input filter already did it while reading the request (causing
     a double response body).  [Yann Ylavic]
I could not find a changelog entry about the 10s delay, but it's possible that 
that has been fixed as well. If the issue is not a regression, you should 
simply release the patch that you have. The fix for the error document seems 
rather invasive:
