It looks like it has been partially reverted upstream:
https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=10231
https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=9c143ce52da11ec3d21a3491c3749841d3dc10f0
However this doesn't work for us either because the changes to "showvars"
also affect the output of "set" which we are using to retrieve the
environment variables in env2debconf.
Apparently, kfreebsd has a working /proc/cmdline (thanks to linprocfs mounted
by default) so we might want to switch to that. I don't know about the
hurd though.
Cheers,
