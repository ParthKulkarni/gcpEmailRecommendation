I'm not sure its important, but when testing a similar script I came up
with something that seems to give better results on the (perhaps
demented) test case I was playing with.  Here's mine:
  's/\([^= ]\+\|\([^= ]*=\("[^"]*"\|'"'[^']*'"'\|[^"'"'"' ][^ ]*\)\)\)\( \|$\)/\1\n/g'
The sed is not as nice to look at though.  I attach my test script.
BTW Should we actually be outputting the bits that contain no '=' for this?
If not, we could just pipe into:
  grep =
Cheers, Phil.
