Right, that looks a fair approach. Worst case, if we come to the point
we need to get a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù busybox for the release (probably in a few days
too), we might end up patching code only for the udeb build, so that we
don't expose regular busybox users to that issue. I'm fine with working
on the logic change to make it possible if it isn't already.
