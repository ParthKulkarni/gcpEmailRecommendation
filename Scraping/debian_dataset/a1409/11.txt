The "PHY" I interpreted like a new kernel (module) is needed for your arm64 device
to get the network up and running. So a new kernel package is needed, unless
you want to run the final system with a module outside of dpkg.

Trying to clarify:
If you only want debian on one (or a few) special system (My case: Trying to get a
Banana M2 Ultra running with an Allwinner R40 ARM SoC) there are other ways to get debian
on such a system up. The way I used sometimes as describe above is to build the normal
kernel package (needed anyways for operating the debian system later on) and
use it for the installation (with some modules compiled in to avoid ramdisk module issues).
If you need something different, sorry if I caused trouble to you.
Greetings
  Hermann
