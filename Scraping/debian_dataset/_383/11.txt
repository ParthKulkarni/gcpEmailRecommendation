... as packages do in unstable, testing and ${stable}-backports. So it's
not a particularly good term to describe the unique feature of the new
repo either. In my eyes, 'fastpaced' makes the point far better.
But as said, the main argument against calling it 'rolling' is that it
would create confusion due to the name already being used in other
(Debian-related) contexts.
