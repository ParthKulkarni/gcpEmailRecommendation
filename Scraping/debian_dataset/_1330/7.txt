I don't think ftp.*.debian.org providers should do https with that name.
We regularly point ftp.*.debian.org to other places when mirrors go away
temporarily, and the only service we guarantee the new target has is
  http://.../debian/
Adding https just makes this a whole extra mess.
By all means offer https on your "base" hostname, like ftp.acc.umu.se,
but please don't do it on ftp.*.debian.org.
