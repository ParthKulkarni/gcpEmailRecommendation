So yeah, some clarification in order I think, and an explanation of 
use-cases.
I don't have a strong opinion on what 64 bit policy Debian should push 
at this point in time.  But I do have some experience with it on Cray.  
I found that FEniCS failed to run on multiple nodes using the standard 
(non-64) libraries (1 or 2 nodes was ok).  But I got it running and 
scaling well up to 60 nodes (1440 processors) when I built against the 
64 bit versions of the libraries (PETSc and others).  It didn't really 
make sense since my mesh didn't have so many degrees of freedom that you 
would have thought 64 bit pointers were needed.  But in practice there 
was a clear operational advantage to having the 64 bit libraries 
available.
