I wondered about this. The mail said that the BLAS/LAPACK ABIs do not
change, so I presumed that this was about internal data layouts for
the data being passed which. But reading the bugreps it does sound
like just a new ABI using ILP64. That would be properly done using
multiarch or multilib paths, and needs some thought about how best to
lay things out and what else would be needed to make it work. Are any
other packages likely to start wanting to use ILP64 ABIs? I guess it's
very much an 'HPC' sort of thing at the moment.
So yeah, some clarification in order I think, and an explanation of use-cases.
