You asked what I _think_ and I shared that with you.
I do not speak on behalf of Netatalk, just brought it up as an example 
of what inspires my thinking.  More specifically what makes me think 
they care about differentiated use cases is their blogging at some point 
about a NAS company using their code unfairly.  but again, I mention 
this not as a piece of fact but as inspiration on how more generally 
some may deal differently with licensing.
You may judge my input unreliable due to not being proven by fact, or 
you may judge my thinking "far out".
