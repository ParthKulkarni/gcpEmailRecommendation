As Carlos, it's hard for me to believe anyone will object to OpenSSL
linking, all the more when they implemented the support for it. Most
upstreams weren't just aware of the need to add an exception (or believe
this is not needed).
In some cases, we ignore the problem too (despite not doing a profit),
even in a case where the copyright holder may have a problem with
OpenSSL (because they would prefer people to use their own SSL
implementation). Here is an old example with Python (not GPL), OpenSSL,
GNU Readline (GPL, no exception):
