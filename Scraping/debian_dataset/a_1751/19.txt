I would like to suggest to treat more libraries as eligible for the
system library exception within Debian.
This would apply to OpenSSL (pre- and post-relicensing), and, perhaps
more importantly, to libgcc (a widely used C run-time library which is
mandatory to link against on some architectures).
libgcc been available under the GPLv3 for some time, and yet we still
use it to compile GPLv2-only programs.  (My understanding is that the
GCC run-time library exception that applies to libgcc does not make
the library licensing GPLv2-compatible, it only helps licenses without
copyleft-like provisions.)
Would it be possible to get real legal advice on this matter, with the
concrete goal to find a usable process to leverage the system library
exception in the GPLv2?
