The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the fourth alpha
release of the installer for Debian 10 "Buster".
Foreword
========
I'd like to start by thanking Christian Perrier, who spent many years
working on Debian Installer, especially on internationalization (i18n)
and localization (l10n) topics. One might remember graphs and blog
posts on Planet Debian with statistics; keeping track of those numbers
could look like a pure mathematical topic, but having uptodate
translations is a key part of having a Debian Installer that is
accessible for most users.
Thank you so much, Christian!
