It's marked as Orphaned in upstream u-boot for 3 months, and failed to
build from source whenever it was I disabled it. With nobody working to
fix it upstream, I dropped it from the Debian u-boot package. You'll can
probably continue to use it with an old u-boot version.
It might continue to work with the buster kernels... I would strongly
recommend testing it and reporting and fixing bugs sooner than later if
you want to make sure it continues to be supported.
Sheevaplug continues to build and is listed as Maintained in upstream
u-boot, but it's an old enough platform that I'd recommend testing it
for those who want to ensure continued support...
