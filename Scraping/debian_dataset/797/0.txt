The SELinux policy could be altered to either run everything that we 
know is not ready to be confined in an unconfined domain or put that 
domain in permissive (which would result in a lot of denials being 
logged), so it's possible to behave more or less the same way as 
AppArmor depending of how the policy is designed.
I feel that having Apparmor running and not doing anything will give 
people a false sense of security, on my test machine almost nothing was 
confined
TBH I'm a bit disappointed with upstream state of Apparmor (no D-Bus 
mediation,...) and other missing features that are still ubuntu only.
