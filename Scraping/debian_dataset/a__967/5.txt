Sharing with wider debian community, hoping to get some support.
Current version in unstable does not have any RC bugs, but recent
changes in the package made release managers not happy with the quality
of the package and it was removed from testing. Now their justification
to not accept unblock request is lack of time to review it before
stretch release.

Hi team,
A review will help with unblock request.
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=858180#37
Losing diaspora-installer after putting years long effort would be very
demotivating.
thanks
Praveen
