It might also be that the flakiness affects all tests.
For example, there is a race in gnupg2's gpg-agent which makes the
dgit test suite fail sometimes.  (#841143, reported in October; now at
last being worked on.)
As it happens, I have chosen (for other reasons[1]) not to run the
test suite during package build, so this is never a FTBFS.  But it
could easily have been a flaky FTBFS.
Ian.
[1] Mainly, that the test suite is computationally intensive and has
an inconveniently large dependency set; this makes it
disproportionate, particularly given that the actual package build is
almost trivial.
