Not exactly. I'm not advocating not failing a build if tests fail
as a general rule.
In this context, I refer specifically to flaky tests. What I call
questionable is keeping a flaky test making the build to fail when the
test fails so much that it's clearly a wrongly designed test.
Or, alternatively, if the test fail a lot and it's correctly designed,
it is questionable not to consider the bug as RC.
Thanks.
