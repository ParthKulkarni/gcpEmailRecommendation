Hi, 
The patch also needs task-gnustep-desktop added as an option to task-desktop, otherwise the live image ships with gnome:
Package: task-desktop
Version: 3.39
Priority: optional
Section: tasks
Source: tasksel
Maintainer: Debian Install System Team <debian-boot@lists.debian.org>
Installed-Size: 6,144 B
Depends: tasksel (= 3.39), xorg, xserver-xorg-video-all, xserver-xorg-input-all, desktop-base
Recommends: task-gnome-desktop | task-xfce-desktop | task-kde-desktop | task-lxde-desktop | task-cinnamon-desktop | task-mate-desktop | task-lxqt-desktop | task-gnustep-desktop,  xdg-utils, avahi-daemon, libnss-mdns, anacron, eject, iw, alsa-utils
Also, a question - your patch does not include default applications like firefox, gimp etc, which the other desktop environments ship with. I understand there are gnustep alternatives to these, is this why you did not include them? The default menus in the live image I've built reference at least firefox, gimp and openoffice (which fail to launch as they are not installed - from a user perspective this is not great). 
Thank you,
Ana
