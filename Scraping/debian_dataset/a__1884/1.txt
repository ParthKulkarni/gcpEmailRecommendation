As a member of the Debian GNUstep team I oppose this and suggest that
the bug is either closed or tagged "wontfix".
There is no official GNUstep desktop.  There were several failed
attempts but they were separate projects and not under the GNUstep
umbrella.  A gnustep-desktop task would be very confusing and
misleading for users as it is reasonable to expect that this
incomplete collection of unrelated apps constitutes a desktop (like
other -desktop packages do).
The packages from src:meta-gnustep already provide convenient ways to
install GNUstep packages en-bloc and should be sufficient for the time
being.
