Hey, -boot
vagrantc added support for the NanoPi in u-boot in version 2016.03~rc3+dfsg1-1,
and i've been playing with it since. Finally, with Linux 4.13, the
NanoPi emac driver has been mainlined, and it (finally!) is starting to
look sensible.
I've got my NanoPi booted and the eth looking happy, but I've not
completed an install yet. Attached is a patch to generate the firmware
image. I was able to test the generated image, and it booted.
Attached is a patch against debian-installer/installer, adding the
NanoPiNeo to the u-boot-image-config.
Thanks for maintaining d-i,
  Paul
