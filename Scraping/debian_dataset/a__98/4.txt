Noted. :)

They have two options (both are already implemented):
 dh_missing --exclude <string>

What made you consider the use of debian/not-installed discouraged?
I am not aware of any intentional warning against using
debian/not-installed.  The only two "warnings" related to not-installed are:
 * Wildcards are not supported.
 * It is not a fancy global "--exclude" mechanism; only a list of files
   that are (intentionally) missing.  I.e. it will not make dh_install
   ignore the file.

Your concrete example suggests this could be solved by wildcard support
in debian/not-installed.  Would that work for you? :)

You are welcome. :)
I was considering to punt this until compat 12, but then I found several
bugs in the interaction between dh_systemd_enable and dh_installinit.
The fixes caused a handful of RC bugs in other packages, which made me
realise that we should fix this sooner rather than later.
