Hi,
Thanks for the feedback. :)

Just a clarification; dh_missing is enabled by default in all compat
levels (being an no-op).  It is a no-op in all stable compat levels
(i.e. <= 10) because it mirrors the default in dh_install.

I have received several requests to make --list-missing or
--fail-missing the default (#650129 and #858834) and I intend to do so
eventually.  I am a little concerned with adding more changes to compat
11 (the list is rather long already), but I am happy with making
--list-missing the default for compat 12.
As for the sequences; we can add those to the next version of debhelper
(a sequence change the parameters passed to a helper).  If you file a
bug for it with how you envision that, then I am happy to add it in one
of the next uploads of debhelper. :)
Thanks,
