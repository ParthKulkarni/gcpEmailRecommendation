Â¡Hola Niels!

It'd make more sense to me to 
change that in compat 11 to be enabled by default and run with --list-missing 
(--fail-missing is probably too much at this point), or make it run with --list 
or --fail-missing, but not enabled by default, and make it an addon. So that one 
can have:
I think one of those two options would make more sense than the status quo, and 
I probably lean towards the first option (enabled by default with --list-missing).
I have received several requests to make --list-missing or 
--fail-missing the default (#650129 and #858834) and I intend to do so 
eventually.  I am a little concerned with adding more changes to compat 
11 (the list is rather long already), but I am happy with making 
--list-missing the default for compat 12.
Please consider adding wildcard support for the debian/not-installed files 
before making this the default. In the package pkg-kde-tools, the 
/usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/qt-kde-team/3/list-missing.mk make script implements 
a (rather primitive) support for wildcards in debian/not-installed which might 
be used as a base for dh_missing.

Otherwise, please make allow this functionality to be easily disabled.
Happy hacking,
