Hi,
the Debian derivative KNOPPIX comes with a boot option "adriane" that 
may help you.Â  An English page I found on 
https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/knoppix-adriane.html which is a bit 
old (2009). The latest version with the Ariadne boot parameter is 
described and downloadable on 
http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/knoppix810.html .
The problem with Debian for supporting blind users is that most of its 
developers are not (yet) visually impaired beyond wearing glasses. They 
don't have the devices which are costly and even if they had then they 
likely have nobody to test it. I have no immediate idea how to help that 
situation.
Cheers,
Steffen
