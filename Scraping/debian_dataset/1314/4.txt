Yes.
Normally a bug like this ("package will not build") is a serious bug,
but in this case it seems like it's "package will not build in
slightly-nonstandard environment".

See Sven's mail:

In the meantime this should be worked around in the Debian packaging,
by setting and exporting SHELL in debian/rules.
I would try adding
  export SHELL=/bin/bash
somewhere near the top of debian/rules.  If that fixes it, you should
send the diff to the Debian bug system and tag your bug "patch".
