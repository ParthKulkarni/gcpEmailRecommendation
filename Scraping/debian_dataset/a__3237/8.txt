Well, it's a bit horrible, but as long as you don't need to type the
kernel command line by hand it's OK.
The code that does the trick is here:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/qa/jenkins.debian.net.git/tree/cucumber/features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb#n217
which you can see the result of at about 27 seconds into this:
  https://jenkins.debian.net/view/lvc/job/lvc_debian-testing-daily/1341/artifact/results/00%3A01%3A57_Install_Debian,_and_boot_to_a_login_prompt,_Examples___1_.mpg
What that does is start a while loop that reads from /dev/ttyS0, and
runs the commands that you type, returning the STDOUT, STDERR, and
result code, separated by various control characters which you probably
don't care about.
If you do that, then you can use nc (or whatever) to connect to the TCP
port which is defined for the KVM's ttyS0, and type commands, and get
their output, followed by a result code.  It's almost like having a shell
prompt, other than the slightly odd ordering of STDERR and the result.
It would probably be better to have a udeb that contains a thing for
running the listener, like the debugging thing that is available in
tails -- theirs returns results in json, and lets one run as users other
than root, and can drop thing into the background, but we don't really
need all that in d-i.
Cheers, Phil.
