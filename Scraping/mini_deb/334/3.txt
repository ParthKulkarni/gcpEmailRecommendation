Yay, I looked into packaging this before, but the toolchain to build this
from source wasn't available then (and I don't know it so I'm not trying to
challenge your claim for this package).
Here's the only bit from my WIP that you'd want to keep:
.--====[ /etc/fonts/conf.avail/30-comic-sans.conf ]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
<match>
  <test name="family"><string>Comic Sans MS</string></test>
  <edit name="family" mode="assign" binding="strong">
    <string>Comic Neue</string>
  </edit>
</match>
</fontconfig>
`----
which is to be symlinked from /etc/fonts/conf.d/30-comic-sans.conf
This handles the whole reason to have this font installed.

Your desc is not hostile enough.  Mine was:

Description: less horrible remake of Comic Sans
 This font is an attempt to fix worst issues in the world's most reviled
 typeface while staying true to the general idea.
 .
 You're still not supposed to actually use the font yourself, but thanks
 to fontconfig substitutions having this package installed will help you
 survive weaponized uses such as the LibreSSL announcement or a html email
 from aunt June.

Ie, using even this remake in text your write is still an offense punishable
by shooting, installing systemd on your machine then dancing on your grave,
but having it present makes _foreign_ text far more palatable.
Meow!
