I completely agree. This led me to look at #813471 ("network access to
the loopback device should be allowed"), and... Well, it seems to set
the stage to the issue we are tackling now: #813471 is opened as a
reaction against #770016 ("Clarify network access for building
packages in main").
I fully agree with Guillem's suggestions, although Pabs has a point in
cuffing the build process more strongly.
But anyway, #770016 worries me as it seems to deal with main only;
however, the precise issue we are discussing was mentioned then as
well by Henrique:
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=770016#48
  And it is is not just for main, I don't think contrib is supposed to
  hit the network during *build*, either.
Bill explicitly mentioned he was not targeting contrib on this bug's
proposed (and accepted) changes:
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=770016#58
  I have no idea abut contrib.
