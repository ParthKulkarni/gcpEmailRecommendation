You are conflating two issues here.
1. Whether packages can be uploaded to contrib temporarily when their
build depends are not in main.
2. Using network during build.

I did not say I will continue to use network access using build, I
already agreed I will use pre-built binaries instead even though I was
not convinced.

Because the shown folly is only in theory and it is never in practice.
As these packages are always uploaded as binary included and never built
on the buildd (as buildds already prohibit network access during build).
If I include pre-built files, nothing changes in practice and only in
perception, hence I'm not convinced.

Indeed, that is the authoritative source when there is a difference of
opinion.

Indeed they are the people who are supposed to ensure this requirement
of policy.

Isn't that how differences to be settled when developers can't reach a
conclusion?

I think you are showing wrong attitude and acting as if you have more
authority over me/others. You are wrongly pushing an opinion that was
not mine. What I asked was the suitability of being in contrib and not
for using network during build.
