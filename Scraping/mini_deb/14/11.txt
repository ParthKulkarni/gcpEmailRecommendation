Minor update on the issue:
The check command provided in the advisory to test for hyper-threading
doesn't work: it will always report hyper-theading as enabled.  A better
command is provided below.
Note: this also means the perl script will give some false-positives.
I apologise for the inconvenience.

The above test (using "grep") does not work, and will always report that
hyper-threading is enabled.
Please use the "lscpu" utility from the util-linux package in a command
line shell (e.g.  xterm):
    lscpu
If the lscpu output reports: "Thread(s) per core: 2", that means
hyper-threading is enabled and supported.
If the lscpu output reports: "Thread(s) per core: 1", that means
hyper-threading either disabled or not supported.  In this case, the
specific defect mentioned in the advisory will not trigger.
