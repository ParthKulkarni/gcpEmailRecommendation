Thank you so much for a content-free and entirely useless message. Note that
I emailed here only after raised a voice because it was five + one week.
Now, in the last six months alone I must have had three or four packages in
NEW, and they never take more than two or three weeks.  But then there are
exceptions : another related package (r-cran-aer, not mine) has been sitting
there for six months.  It is impossible for me to tell "why".  And you did
not help AT ALL with the more germane issue of us ("developers") being
entirely unable to get feedback of WHY a package HANGS when it does.
Which sucks. And is a FTBFS for my package.
Dirk
