Actually, in most cases that I've seen, upstream cares more about *also*
supporting older standards (for the benefit of users using older
distributions whose default compiler doesn't yet support the newer
standard) than they care about the default standard in use.
I think this question originated from a desire to manage C++ ABIs
better. It's true that introducing a new C++ compiler which defaults to
a different ABI will cause issues if not handled properly. However, we
already have plenty of tooling in place to manage ABI differences, and I
don't think this adds much.
Currently, when the default C++ compiler changes ABI, what's needed is a
coordinated transition where every C++ library package is updated in
turn. Adding a default C++ ABI at the package level does not change
that, and therefore I don't think we need to introduce it.
