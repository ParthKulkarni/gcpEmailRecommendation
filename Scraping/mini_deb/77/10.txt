Often mainline Linux doesn't support particular embedded/mobile
systems (especially ARM/MIPS) or has a bug that isn't present in the
vendor version of Linux.
Here is an example from debian-arm recently where Debian userspace
requirements blocked part of an investigation of a mainline Linux
kernel bug:

Pretty much any ARM mobile device that ships with Android only has the
possibility of running Debian in a chroot.

Another example is one of my ADSL modems, which can run a Debian
userspace in a chroot under the vendor version of Linux but is never
going to run Linux mainline. In addition, Debian bumped the MIPS
baseline for some reason so it can't run anything later than Debian
jessie anyway.
