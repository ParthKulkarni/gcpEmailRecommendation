Ping?
As you uploaded the package to t-p-u before the release, it has now
ended up in proposed-updates.
However, it is *still* unfixed in unstable. What's your plan for getting
that sorted? We will not be including the package in a stretch point
release until the fix is applied in unstable.
(As a side note, given that you are the maintainer of the package, why
was the upload version -2.1?)
