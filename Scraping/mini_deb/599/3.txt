The relevant question is whether there is a non-zero amount of packages 
where a 1.11 -> 1.15 switch would be hard.
One important package that is hard to convert to 1.15 could be enough to 
keep automake1.11 even in buster (we have 5 different autoconf versions 
in stretch...).

What you describe is somewhere between "minor" and not worth reporting.
But several packages have
  automake1.11 | automake (>= 1:1.11)
Ouch.
