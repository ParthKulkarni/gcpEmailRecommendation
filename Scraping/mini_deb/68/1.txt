https://wiki.debian.org/BusterPriorityRequalification has some interesting
discussion.
Making things non-Essential is indeed hard, but making them Important[1]
is easier as for most tools these two are considered synonymous.
As we're very early in Buster's cycle, a somewhat cavalier approach could
be acceptable: to degrade programs and see what breaks.  It's safe for
upgrades (tools really dislike removing Important) and for new regular
whole-machine installs; only uses that might have issues are chroots
and small containers.

I've done some research, and:
* user-facing tools support Important well enough, as of Stretch:
  while dpkg itself doesn't protest, frontends like apt, dselect, aptitude,
  synaptic, gnome-packagekit, apper are all _too_ paranoid here.  This is
  actually good for ordinary users -- converting a full machine to a
  container isn't exactly a common use case.
  The only frontend that doesn't stop you is cupt, but with popcon vote of
  23 it's not much of a concern, especially that you tend to remove Buster
  packages using Buster tools.
* on the other hand, current dpkg-gencontrol does not support this field
* the Policy doesn't mention it either
Thus: it's not legal to use Important yet but there are no blockers to
have it for Buster.
If you'd like to play some more, my test packages are in:
deb http://angband.pl/debian essimp main
(-src, https), key:
wget -qO- https://angband.pl/deb/archive.html|apt-key add -
"test-essential", "test-important"

As Steve Langasek mentioned, not all containers are alike.  Unlike old-style
implementations like vserver or openvz (even they let you allow ccaps
SECURE_MOUNT and BINARY_MOUNT), modern containers are a really fuzzy
concept, with a mix-and-match of chroot, cgroups, namespaces, seccomp.
But there's a pretty common set of things typical containers don't need.
They don't need to manipulate partitions, fsck, etc.  That's most of
util-linux's size.

Yeah but a container has a host which can rescue it, and then you can
install anything you want into the container.  So it's about minimal
functionality only.
Meow!
[1]. A poorly chosen name, because of confusion with priority:important.
But AFAIK it was repurposing an ancient hidden feature rather than a new
design.
