Hi Adam,
Thanks for the feedback. :)

I have not, but my gut feeling does indeed agree that it will the vast
majority that "just works(tm)" or FTBFS.  That said, checksums +
diffoscope should assist with anything in between.
(Reminder: static ownerships are still not covered at the moment, so
packages needing those must be in the FTBFS bucket with RÂ³=no).

I do understand your concern. However:
 * This proposal is primarily an interface between the package and
   buildpackage/the builders tool.  The debhelper part is just gluing
   this together so it becomes easy to adopt in the average case.
 * The compat level is an interface between the package and debhelper.
   IOW, it would be ill-suited to support RÂ³ as it is not an interface
   to one of the most important members of the specification.
 * Even if we could use a debhelper compat level to introduce RÂ³, it
   would have neutered the adoption rate.  We got plenty of packages,
   where maintainers want to have their package backportable to stable,
   oldstable and even oldoldstable (not to mention various Ubuntu LTS
   releases).
 * For those concerned about mirror metadata (was not mentioned in
   Adam's mail), the RÂ³ field is not inserted in the .dsc with dpkg
   1.19.0.  Accordingly, this has no affect on the size of the
   Sources files.
Thanks,
~Niels
