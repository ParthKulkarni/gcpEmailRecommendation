Oh, regarding the Ubuntu installer:
please configure the keyboard layout _before _prompting for the
LUKS passphrase!
and don't prompt for eCryptfs-protected /home, when LUKS is already
configured.  (Or remove support for this completely).
If the user configured a network connection already, it would be nice if
the latest packages were fetched (rather installing old ones from the
install media, and upgrading in a later step).
