I have been using IBM/Lenovo T Series for > 15 Years and never had major
issues. Given that with APM nobody expected suspend/resume to work,
optimus grafic is a PITA and a waste of money. I have a T420 currently
where everything works, we have tons of T460 at work and dont have any issues.
There is stuff which does not work - Hot Plug Monitor for example
is an issue. With digital ports e.g. HDMI/DVI/DP this typically
works out of the box - The new display gets detected - The point
is that for me the only desktop which remembered the Display positions
was gnome2 - Its broken since then. So when i dock at work i have
a shell script which uses xrandr to shuffle displays around.
Hotkeys for Suspend/Resume get more or less redundant as the typical
Desktop environment login/logout procedures contain all the
functionality.
