I'd like to know why giving the world (Other) read access is even under 
consideration. If user wants a file to have Other readability this 
should be on the user to set it, but it should not be the default.
What is the justification that every user be able to read everyone 
else's documents?
This discussion should be on whether to set a default UMASK of 077 or 
027.
NOTE: this discussion is moot at the present time anyway because it is 
impossible to set a UMASK at all on Debian Stretch. None of the usual 
ways work within gnome on Debian Stretch. Can anyone comment on this 
fact?
