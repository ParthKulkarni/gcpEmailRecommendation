Surprise to the users if they still use the old package - which they
shouldn't since it has been of support for a long time, but these things
happen.
Another surprise, if they found a recommendation for the old package but
get the new one.

In my opinion: Wait until the old package is burried and forgotten. So the
gap should rather be somewhat ten years.
Or: Never ever re-use a package name. Also: Reject NEW packages with
short names (say, less than six characters) since it's quite likely they
will collide semantically with something else.
Or: Introduce package namespaces, this is a big change. The existing
flat model one with somewhat hundred thousand (wild guess) entries over
the past 25 years worked quite well most of the time, although not
always (git, node). But it's obvious there is a problem in the very long
run, and it seems wise to think about that before it becomes pressing.
For a start, there is the Section: information, then a sound/dino and a
net/dino could co-exist.
