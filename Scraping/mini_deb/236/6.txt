Neither does our PTS for packages in still supported releases, nor BTS ever,
nor user machines that still have the extinct dino installed.  But that's
easily fixable by making sure your version number is higher (use an epoch if
you must).
There is another concern: I'd refrain with reintroduction until at least one
dino-less release.  Oh wait, stretch is already out.
