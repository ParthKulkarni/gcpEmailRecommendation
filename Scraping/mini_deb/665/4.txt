Perhaps --primary-keyring will help because it marks one keyring for use
with key-importing commands. I haven't tried it but it would seem that
all other keyrings are then read-only.
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf:
    primary-keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
    keyring /usr/share/...
    keyring /usr/share/...
    keyring /usr/share/...
