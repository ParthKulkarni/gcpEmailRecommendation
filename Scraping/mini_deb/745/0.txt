Sorry, I was unclear in my original email, but you missed the second
part: it's a convenient way to install most or all of the "simple"
GNOME games, some of which were never even in the original gnome-games
binary package.

Several packages depend on the gnome-games metapackage and it's not
practical to change all of them this late in the stretch Freeze. The
best that could be done would be to make it a transitional package for
stretch. Remove it for buster and then re-use the name in buster+1.
But I don't think it's worth it.
You can do like I did and complain to the developer for re-using the
name if you want. And then move on, if the arguments don't work. (It's
still not packaged in many distros and I wouldn't mind renaming it in
Debian.)
Thanks,
