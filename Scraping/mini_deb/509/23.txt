Just wondering why we need to control the branch name of proposed topic 
branch, or even use a single repo to receive contributions.
My thought is that all we need is the "Pull Request / Merge Request" feature 
on Alioth, where random contributors (who might have absolutely no permission 
anywhere) can create forks (forked repositories) freely and request for review 
and eventual merge from the forked repo into main repo if necessary. People 
are much familiar with such workflow similar to GitHub / GitLab's fork-and-
merge behaviour.
That would also be much easier than setting up custom access control rules 
based on permission inside a single repository.
