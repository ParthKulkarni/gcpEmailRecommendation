Isn't the obviously correct and policy compliant approach to just
Conflicts/Replaces (or Breaks/Replaces depending on the force you want
to apply here) with the init-select package from one of the grub
packages, and on that grub package ship a stub init-select.cfg with
just a comment explaining what's going on. And in the next release cycle,
just make that package remove its (now) own conffile?
Thanks,
