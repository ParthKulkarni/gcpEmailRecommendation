It occured to me that I can provide data on how much such a rebuild would
take.  Of course, a fat elebenty-core machine with gobs of RAM can do the
whole archive in hours, while a shit ARM SoC takes over two months, but
proportions should be roughly same.
Packages with an OpenSSL build-dependency are pretty heavy: there are 714
ones depending on libssl-dev, taking 7.7% of total archive rebuild time.
As for libssl1.0-dev, it's 271 packages taking 2.5% of time.
On said shit SoC that's 5 and 1.6 days respectively.  I don't know what's
under your desk, but I don't suspect you of using a machine that can't do
such a rebuild under a day.
Meow!
