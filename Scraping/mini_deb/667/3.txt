Mine is very basic. As you noticed, I had (and have) a host side bridge, to
which I bind all my virtual machines.

My setup has network-manager, which remains independent of the host bridge
managed by systemd-networkd. NM is used for the Host's networking needs to
external interfaces, which is mostly wifi.
I don't think I ever tried setting up a bridge through network-manager. But NM
does show my systemd-networkd based bridge in its listing.
