Hi folks,
I've never done much in the way of cross-compiling before. I understand it was 
once very hard, is now much easier, and is considerably easier for "simple" 
packages (including the kernel) than others.
I do not need to use multiarch for my builder, yet dpkg-buildpackage (if I 
supply -a aarch64, interestingly ARM64 doesn't work) complains of unmet build
dependencies, which I have resolved for amd64.  But perhaps -a to 
dpkg-buildpackage is the wrong approach.
