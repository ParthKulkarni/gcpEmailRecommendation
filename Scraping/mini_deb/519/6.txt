Gregor,
Sorry for the late reply. Were you able to file a bug in apt-listbugs
or should I ? I'm still seeing the same  issue/bug still.
[$]  apt-listbugs list wpasupplicant
                                                             [5:32:13]
Retrieving bug reports... Done
Parsing Found/Fixed information... Done
grave bugs of wpasupplicant (‚Üí ) <Outstanding>
 b1 - #849122 - With 2.6-2 i dont have the wifi adapter in the
(network-manager) list available.
serious bugs of wpasupplicant (‚Üí ) <Outstanding>
 b2 - #849077 - wpasupplicant: [Regression] Updating wpasupplicant
makes not possible to connect to encrypted WiFi
 b3 - #849875 - broadcom-sta-dkms: Wifi association took too long,
failing activation
Summary:
 wpasupplicant(3 bugs)
I don't know much about 'epoch' but I could make reference to the
discussion on debian-devel. That might be enough for the apt-listbugs
maintainers to take some call.
Btw pkg-wpa-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org seems to be a moderated list
and haven't heard anything from them till yet as well.
Looking forward to your advice/answer.
Till later.
