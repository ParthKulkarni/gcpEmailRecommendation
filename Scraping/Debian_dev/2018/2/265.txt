  Description     : Ultrafast consensus module for raw de novo genome assembly of long uncorrected reads
Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct raw
contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a
consensus step, such as Miniasm.
The goal of Racon is to generate genomic consensus which is of similar
or better quality compared to the output generated by assembly methods
which employ both error correction and consensus steps, while
providing a speedup of several times compared to those methods.

The package is relevant to the field of genome assembly and will be
maintained by the Debian Med team.
