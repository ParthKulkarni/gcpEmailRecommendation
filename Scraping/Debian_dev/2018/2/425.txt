Indeed it does, but not necessarily the way we handle it now.

Maybe you answered your question yourself. How about we tie our
security support to upstream's? Instead of fixing and backporting
ourselves we promise our users that this section of the archive will
get upstream's latest fixes even if that means the version number
changes.
This way the users would get a lot of benefits from using Debian but no
 drawback compared to the self-installed alternative.
