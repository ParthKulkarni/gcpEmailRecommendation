How can we avoid upstream not making source available for their
binaries? Because this is fundamentally the issue with shipping only
minified javascript without any sources or reference of where it comes
from. This also isn't a problem in Debian, it's a broken JavaScript
ecosystem that's driven by very poor software developers who tend to
want to smack together anything that will work for a little while so
that they can get paid for their work and move on to the next bad project.

Which requirements are you referring to? If it's relaxing the need for
source for minified javascript, then no thanks.

What would this solve and how will it solve it?

As someone who intends to package software that contains some embedded
low-quality JavaScript code, yes, certainly frustrated. But with the
JavaScript community and their underdeveloped ideas of how software
works, not with Debian.
