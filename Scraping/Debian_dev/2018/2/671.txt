Sounds cool. But why would this application run only on this particular
Live CD and not any Debian-based OS? You mentioned Tails as being too
heavy to implement this there and ask people to download and run Tails -
understood. However, if your application were available as a Debian
package, Tails / Debian_unlive / Ubuntu users could also benefit from
it. And people would not have to download an entire Live System but
could simply do that in Tails :)
Anyhow, this is a comment which does not help you search for a mentor,
sorry about that & good luck!
Cheers,
Ulrike
