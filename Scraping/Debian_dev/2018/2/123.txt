Depends on what you mean by hurt. I see epochs being used w/o much
tought or care, on many situations where they are not supposed to be
used, and they are permanent stigmas. In addition to
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/04/msg00203.html>, they
also reset the monotonic versioning increment, marking version
barriers at which points making comparisons becomes useless.
IMO pushing epoch bumps upstream, or doing epoch bump races to compete
with external or third-party repositories (like what happened with the
debian-multimedia packages) would be a mistake, because as I mentioned
on that referenced mail, we'd be dependent on epoch blunders from all
our downstreams, and might end up with such a mess of our version
space to make it unusable.

This is not a hack, this is how it's supposed to be done. dpkg has
supported different source and binary versions for a very long time,
if not forever.
