Hey list,
I would like to ship some example files with my package. My Makefile.am
has something to the effect of...
    examplesdir=$(docdir)/examples
    examples_DATA = \
        $(srcdir)/Data/Examples/some_example_file \
        ...
    EXTRA_DIST = \
        $(examples_DATA) \
        ...
This installs the example files as expected in
/usr/share/doc/foo/examples/, but I was still left to wonder what the
best practise was given that dh_installexamples(1) exists and seems to
want to do the same based on the contents of debian/foo.examples?
