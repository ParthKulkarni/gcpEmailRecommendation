I am not talking about introducing packages to Debian, I am talking
about keeping packages that Debian is already providing to users as 
part of the current stable.

QA-maintained orphaned packages are *a lot* better maintained than 
NMU-maintained packages that have a "maintainer".
E.g. when I find an easy to fix FTBFS in an orphaned package I can
just make a QA upload right away instead of submitting a bug report.
For any other issue no matter how important or trivial anyone
can also make a QA upload of an orphaned package immediately.
And there are plenty of people reading the bug emails for orphaned 
packages, fixing many reported issues quickly.
For an NMU there has to be a good reason for doing an NMU,
and NMUs should contain only necessary changes.

I am just pointing out the problem that we are currently forcing
a maintainer to shame herself/himself when orphaning a package,
while executing zero-reason RM requests quickly and silent.

All is solvable for DSA as user.
A normal user doesn't have any chance to have such own metapackages
included in Debian.

Chances are this will either result in no answer,
public maintainer shaming, or both.
Like in the case at hand of a zero-reason RM, where it would be 
appropriate to Cc the mailing list of the affected port when
asking the maintainer.
