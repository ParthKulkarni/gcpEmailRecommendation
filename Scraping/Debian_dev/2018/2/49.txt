The place that contains all such data (including RM bugs)
for a package is tracker.debian.org.
It also contains many other information that could be relevant for
you in that case, for example it shows when the package is orphaned or 
when there is an open RFS request (that might already fix your problem).
Duplicating tracker in the BTS doesn't sound like a good approach to me.

If someone file an RM bug against a package without the consent of the 
maintainer and without Cc'ing the maintainer when submitting the RM bug,
then the problem is the person who submitted the RM bug.
