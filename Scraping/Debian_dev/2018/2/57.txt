Copyright problems don't make the package any less useful.

What if it crashes on startup only with systemd?  This currently means the
majority of users, but doesn't make the package any less useful for me.

What if it FTBFSes on s390x?  What if it may cause serious data loss on ext2
with a split /var setup?

I have only a limited amount of tuits.  The package works fine for me, an
unrelated problem with it -- or perhaps, a library for iCrap it transitively
depends on -- is not an immediate problem that affects me.
As the release freeze nears, I'd probably get off my butt and at least work
around the problem to get the package back in testing, but I'd grumble while
doing so.  I'm also a DD, which most users are not -- their means of getting
a package they need into shape are limited.
I do look at packages that don't affect me (I for one usually look at
orphaned stuff), but I'm not going to fix something written in PHP, Go or
Cobol even if it's a dependency of something I need -- unless perhaps just
before release, at a cost of effort that would be a lot lesser for someone
else who actually knows that language or package.
