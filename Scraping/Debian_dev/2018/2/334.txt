Hello everybody,
the fact that I had to request the removal of dolibarr from Debian makes
me sad (see below for the reasons) and I believe that we should be able
to do better to provide complex applications to our end users.
Dolibarr is not alone:
- while gitlab is packaged in Debian, its packaging took years and the
  result is brittle because it can break in many ways whenever one the 
  dozens of dependencies gets updated to some new upstream version
  (BTW salsa.debian.org does not use the official package)
- I have the Debian packaging of distro-tracker (the code behind
  tracker.debian.org) available in the git repository for years
  but I never released it into Debian because it embeds a few javascript
  libraries (bootstrap, jquery) and I don't want to validate that
  it does work with the versions currently in Debian
I'm sure we are missing lots of good applications due to our requirements.
What can we do to avoid this?
I don't have any definite answers although there are ideas to explore:
- we could relax our requirements and have a way to document the
  limitations of those packages (wrt our usual policies)
- we could ship those applications not as .deb but as container
  and let them have their own lifecycle
What do you think? Do you have other ideas? Are there other persons
who are annoyed by the current situation?
Cheers,
