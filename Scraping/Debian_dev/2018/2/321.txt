The name for the source package should use the python- prefix as in
Python the language. The python3- prefix is intended for the binary
package providing the modules for the Python 3 interpreter.

Thank you for the comprehensive description and personal motivation.
You did not mention why this package needs to be packaged though (as
opposed to being installed via pip). Is it required by another package
(or upcoming update of) currently in the archive?
