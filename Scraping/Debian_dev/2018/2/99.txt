  Description     : Wizards API
Provides a simple API and UI for Wizards, a commonly used UI pattern in GUI 
interfaces. Traditionally, everybody has needed to write their own 
Wizards from scratch, and such code is painful and hard to get right. 
This library aims to provide a simple, relatively bulletproof API 
for writing Wizards. The UI for Wizards is pluggable; the default
implementation conforms to the JLF usability guidelines for Wizards.
This library was originally designed as a replacement for NetBeans' Wizard API,
and takes into account the long history
of that API and issues encountered with it over the years. It provides a 
simple, easy-to-use solution that enables any Swing application to provide 
Wizards with a minimum of code and effort.
This library (albeit being abandonware) would be needed for VASSAL engine 
integration. Similar functionality can be provided by Netbeans, but the
API is radically different.
I'm going to maintain it by myself, not much of activity is spotten on
the upstream.
