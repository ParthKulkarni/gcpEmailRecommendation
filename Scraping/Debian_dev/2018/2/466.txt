Why do you think Didier's proposal, in particular, represents an
opportunity to do this?  Is it simply that it will require whole new
tools to prepare and distribute the .vdebs, so we might as well not use

No, but we might often have reason to maintain a small delta.  We patch
upstream source for all sorts of reasons; it is hard to believe it
wouldn't come up.
