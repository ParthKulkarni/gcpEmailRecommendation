I think we should keep software that doesn't meet our standards
outside of Debian. There are plenty of ways to deploy such software,
we do not need to diverge from upstream's deployment methods
(containers etc) unless that software is suitable for packaging within
Debian; under a free license, source-only tarballs/VCS available,
builds everything from source, no embedded code/data copies etc. These
are violated a *lot* already for packages already in Debian, I think
we should aim to reduce that rather than increase it.
