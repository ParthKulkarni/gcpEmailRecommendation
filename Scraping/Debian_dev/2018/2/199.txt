  Description     : Equinox OSGi framework
This package includes the Eclipse Equinox OSGi framework, which
can be used outside Eclipse. Equinox is an implementation of the OSGi
core framework specification, a set of bundles that implement various
optional OSGi services and other infrastructure for running OSGi-based
systems. The Equinox OSGi core framework implementation is used as the
reference implementation and as such it implements all the required
features of the latest OSGi core framework specification.
More generally, the goal of the Equinox project is to be a first class
OSGi community and foster the vision of Eclipse as a landscape of
bundles. As part of this, it is responsible for developing and
delivering the OSGi framework implementation used for all of Eclipse.
This package is already in Debian but is currently built from
src:eclipse. To improve the maintainability of libequinox-osgi-java
and since it is rather difficult to maintain the Eclipse IDE as a
whole (#681726) we go this route to reduce complexity and to ensure
that reverse-dependencies of libequinox-osgi-java continue to function
even when the Eclipse IDE does not.
