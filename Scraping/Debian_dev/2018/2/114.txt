rsync and scp have similar behaviour.
Basically, `:' is annoying in filenames.  Encoding it would have been
possible but we don't encode anything else.  And I think a rule
against reusing the same upstream version with a different epoch is
entirely sensible, anyway.
There are a lot of things I did many years ago which now turn out to
have been mistakes; I don't think this is one of them.
Ian.
