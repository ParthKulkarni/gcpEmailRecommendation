  Description     : Privacy Badger blocks spying ads and invisible trackers
Privacy Badger is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other
third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you
look at on the web.  If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple
websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that
advertiser from loading any more content in your browser.  To the advertiser,
it's like you suddenly disappeared.
Git has already been created for webext-team on salsa.
