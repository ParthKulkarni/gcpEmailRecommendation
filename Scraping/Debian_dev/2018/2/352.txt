We cannot feasibly provide security updates when there is more than one
version of the library in the archive.  We do not, and probably never
will have, the required manpower.
This applies to the nixos/guix solutions too -- we cannot expect our
security team to go around backporting patches to all the different
versions we're offering to users.
