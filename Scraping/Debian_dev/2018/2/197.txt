  Description     : Parser for Ducktype, a lightweight documentation syntax
 Ducktype is a lightweight non-XML syntax for Mallard, a topic-oriented
 markup language for help files. Mallard is primarily used in GNOME help.
 The ducktype package contains the ducktype command-line tool, which
 can be used to convert Ducktype documents into the Mallard XML format
 for further processing by the tools and stylesheets in the yelp-tools
 and yelp-xsl packages.
 The python3-mallard.ducktype package contains the Python 3 library.
Ducktype is used for a document in dbus providing D-Bus API design advice,
which we don't yet ship in Debian. It might be used for help files in
GNOME in future, but as far as I know all GNOME apps use the XML variant
of Mallard at the moment.
I intend to maintain this in the GNOME team, or possibly the Python
Modules team when they switch to gbp-pq and salsa.debian.org.
Co-maintainers welcome (indeed, sole maintainers welcome if someone
wants to take this away from me).
