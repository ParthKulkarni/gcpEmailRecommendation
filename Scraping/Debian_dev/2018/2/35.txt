True, it hasn't. But if you look a little bit closer, you'll see both RC
bugs it had were quite trivial to fix: two sourceless files (would be
fixed by linking them to the packaged versions instead), and an failed
attempt to download a build-dep (actually, fixed by an NMU while fixing
another bug, just never marked as done).
