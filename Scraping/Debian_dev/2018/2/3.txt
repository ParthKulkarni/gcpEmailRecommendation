Sounds like a very good idea. For me, I could automatically parse these
and check against the list of packages installed on my systems, or are
used to build packages (thanks for .buildinfo files) outside the archive.

The short period, but not *that* short. I'd expect any reaction will be
pretty soon but allow people to be offline for a week. In the situation
where removal is obviously the right thing to do, waiting months is
mostly horror.

Certainly, packages to be removed from (old)stable in a point release
should go through that procedure aswell.

For this I'd prefer to have a guideline so this isn't entirely left to the
submitter's discretion. It boils down to "do no harm". So removing cruft
like NVIU certainly can do done straight ahead, while ROM/ROP/RoQA
should get some audience and time.
