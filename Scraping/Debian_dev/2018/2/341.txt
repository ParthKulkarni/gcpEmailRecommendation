Quoting Holger Levsen <holger@layer-acht.org>:
If I understand Samuels idea correctly, he likes to have multiple
versions of the same (JavaScript) library installed on Debian.
Not "stuff", but proper Debian packages, with all bells and whistles.
Only that you don't remove necessarily the old version, when the new
one comes in. Similar to C libraries, kernel, etc. but with a different
way to actually use the files, of course.
The underlying problem is that:
 - We package a JS library. Everything is fine.
 - A new version comes. Incompatible? Maybe. Probably.
 - If we keep the old version, people complain how outdated we are.
 - If we upgrade the package, both packaged software and customer
   installed programs break.
This is very much a web application problem. Other software is
less affected in my experience.
Maybe we just have to package JS libraries with their version
number in the package name in the first place?
Cheers
