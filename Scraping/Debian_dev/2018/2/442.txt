Hello, as a sysadmin and Ubuntu derivatives[1] at work, I remembered
having the nice surprise of some incompatible changes in MySQL some time
ago.
Backporting the fix was not possible/too complex so new upstream patch
level was integrated, modifying something around comments handling in
.sql files IIRC.
Finding the erratic problem, fixing it and distributing it was quite
‚Äúintensive‚Äù.
We monitor the -proposed repository but the change passed unseen by our
jenkins.
So please, before considering following upstream, consider what a
sysadmin needs to do to upgrade/test/deploy the configuration.
I'm dreaming the day every configuration file will be managed by
Config::Model but even this is not bullet proof ;-)
my 2¬¢.
