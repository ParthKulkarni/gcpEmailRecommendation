This is true. We would have to be clear, that security support
would have to be limited to one (the latest?) version. This is
still a difference to some arbitrary compressed js files with no
source code, no copyright information etc. which people use when
there is no Debian package at all.
But it's probably too much work, preparing infrastructure etc.
Anyway, relaxing requirements on source code availability,
building from sources with tools within Debian, free license,
etc. is not an option for me. Not only in the context of Debian.
