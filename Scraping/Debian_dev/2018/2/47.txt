As the FTP team is the single most important one in Debian, and also quite
overworked, I'd refrain from anything that makes their workflow more
tedious.  If they have to read every bug over and over to check if it's good
to be acted on, it'd waste a lot of their time.
Thus, it's good to keep RMs as something that can be acted on immediately.
That's why I proposed to have the burden of that "unripe RM" state carried
by wnpp.  There are other good proposals, like an usertagged bug on the
package itself -- all that matters is a way to query these in bulk, to get a
list you can automatically compare to what you have on your system[s], etc.
Meow!
