They are not.
Ideally Debian should provide and support the software, but support that 
might suddenly go away without any clear option forward is the worst
option Debian could offer.
What is the user supposed to do when Debian announces that some 
software essential for that user is no longer supported in the
stable release the user is using?
At that point the options for the user are either to continue using 
software that might already have known grave vulnerabilities, or to
do a rushed attempt trying to find some way to self-install an upstream
version that is still supported.
This is clearly worse than using a self-installed version from the 
start, which gives the user the knowledge how to use the self-installed 
version (that might differ from how Debian provides the software) and 
gives a clear picture from the start when upgrades to new major versions 
will have to be planned.
