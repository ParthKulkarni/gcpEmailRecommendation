My reading is a way more radical. To me:
RFA: Please adopt it, I lost interest and the package is bit-rotting.
I'm doing the bare minimal work.
O: Package is unmaintained, hurry or the package is in danger to be removed.
ITR: No meaning, see "O:" that already covers it...
If you introduce ITR, then RFA will become meaningless. Let's not do
that and improve the RM bug procedure as you suggest below.

Orphaning is already a sign of urgency, since it means there's no
maintainer anymore. We don't need anything else.

Having ITR wont change the fact you have other priorities (ie: to be
read as "no time for it", as this is the same thing).

There's many reasons why a RM can take place, sometimes it's not at all
about stopping maintenance. For example, I was maintaining
python-pyldap, which was a fork of python-ldap, but it got merged back,
so pyldap had no meaning anymore as soon as ldap was in version >= 3. In
such case, RM as quick as possible is the way to go.
However, in the case we're discussing (ie: lost of interest by the
current maintainer), I agree we could add a mandatory delay, probably by
adding some kind of field in reportbug.

Definitively, IMO it should be kept within the boundaries of the RM bug.
That's the thing we could improve to avoid RM-ing packages too fast, and
advertise when a package is being removed.
