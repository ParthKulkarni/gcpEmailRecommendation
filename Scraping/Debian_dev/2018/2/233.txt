The answer was "yes", in fact.

I'm unsure how you've deduced "i386 wasn't a problem" when the above
clearly shows that the lack of a lua-torch-torch7 package on several
architectures is a current blocker for the migration.
The lack of lua-torch-torch7 on i386 would also have been the cause of
your original issue - arch:all packages must be installable on both
amd64 and i386 currently; if they are not, you need to ask the Release
Team to consider adding a hint to force the testing migration scripts
to ignore the issue.
