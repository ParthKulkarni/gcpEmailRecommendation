Felipe,
Many thanks for this. Your point is well made and I have now got a working
version that lintian doesn't complain about.
However, in trying to understand more fully when postinst is called with
configure and reconfigure arguments, it appears that reconfigure is not
currently supported at all. It is not mentioned in the Policy and ancient bug
#215549 was closed as wontfix. So although reconfigure is in the postinst
skeleton the distinction is not observed. The only possible way to distinguish
is using the hack that DEBCONF_RECONFIGURE=1 is set in the postinst
environment. See debconf-devel(7).
Or am I missing something?
