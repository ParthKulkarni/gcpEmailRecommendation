Description: simple system monitor app for GNOME
 Usage is an application for GNOME that allows monitoring of system resources
 such as memory, CPU, and disk space.
Other Info
--------------
This is the first release of GNOME Usage. I think the intent is for
this app to replace Disk Usage Analyzer (baobab), GNOME System
Monitor, and GNOME Power Statistics (gnome-power-manager) in core
GNOME in a future GNOME release.
But baobab and gnome-system-monitor may continue to be maintained to
provide more powerful features. GNOME Usage doesn't provide power
statistics yet.
Packaging is at
