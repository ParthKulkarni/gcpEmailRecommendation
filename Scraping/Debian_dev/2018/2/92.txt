Dear mentors,
Following the checklist for new packages on debian mentors FAQ [2] I'm
approaching the review point: "Ask on the debian-mentors mailing list
for people to check your packaging..."
So: Have anyone time to check my package ddupdate[1] for errors and
mistakes?
packaging-wise, ddupdate is a small python3 application with very few
dependencies.
As can be seen below, this is the second time I send this message; the
first time was too early.
Cheers!
