Hello,
I am trying to upgrade apt-cacher to Standards version 4.1.3. In particular
using DISABLED=yes|no in /etc/defaults is now prohibited.
apt-cacher can be run as a daemon or from /etc/inetd.conf and this configuration
is set in response to a debconf question.
I have a working version of the postinst which I believe complies with the new
policy by no longer changing a value in /etc/default/apt-cacher, however it
contains multiple calls to update-rc.d (one to register the init file and then
calls to enable/disable as appropriate in response to db_get). This produces the
lintian error: duplicate-updaterc.d-calls-in-postinst.
Is my approach flawed or is lintian being overzealous?
Any other suggestions?
A pruned version of postinst is below.
Thanks for your help.

Manual configuration of apt-cacher startup selected. No changes made.
If you are operating legacy CGI mode, this is deprecated and you really should
consider changing to one of the daemon modes. See cgi_advise_to_use and
cgi_redirect in man apt-cacher(8) for help in redirecting your clients.
To change your choice, run 
  dpkg-reconfigure apt-cacher
