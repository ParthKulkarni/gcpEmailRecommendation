This seems really wrong.  Note GregKH's commit message:
# It's time to get rid of IRDA.  It's long been broken, and no one seems
# to use it anymore.  So move it to staging and after a while, we can
# delete it from there.
You just disproved that "no one seems to use it", and you also volunteer to
do the work fixing it.

Maintaining an out-of-tree module is drastically more work than in-tree.  It
doesn't get testing (even if compile-only), doesn't see updates when people
change internal interfaces, and notoriously gets out of sync with current
kernels.  Quality requirements for staging drivers are really low precisely
to discourage people from working out of tree.
I think you really need to talk to GregKH and submit your fixes there.
Meow!
