Is it a goal of Debian to accumulate applications? It is a priority to
offer a robust and solid system: Other Debian derivatives accept
relaxations: I think Debian must maintain its line.
I believe that the right way is to
convince developers of the need to generate applications that respect
the principles of free code.
And another strategy, is to get developers to write "specifically" for
Debian.
