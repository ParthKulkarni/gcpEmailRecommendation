Noone talks about a committee, this is about a pre-removal grace period
where people can raise objections.
testing removals have a grace period, which gives me and others a chance
to fix issues.
Do you have any suggestion better than "ITP immediately followed by 
orphaning" for packages I consider useful but don't want to maintain 
myself long-time?
Note that as sad as it is, the QA maintainance of orphaned packages
is better than the (non)maintainance of a huge part of our packages
that officially have a maintainer - keeping my name in the maintainer
field would be worse than having the QA team there.

A human problem is that it is quick and painless to submit
a zero-reason RM request.
It is much harder for many people to orphan a package,
part of the reason is that this feels like admitting
that she/he has not done a proper job.
Making RM requests as visible as orphaned packages
(e.g. in a weekly debian-devel post) would help here.

If you have a 0.1% probability of being killed by a car every day
you cycle to work, would you call that "virtually a non-problem"
or "life expectancy reduced to 4 more years"?
There is also not much time for a removal to become controversial
in a way that you would notice.
Only a tiny fraction of our users are using unstable.
In this specific case it was DSA, and they were using the package
from unstable. That's a rare exception.
If users notice that a package important for them is no longer
in Debian, they will typically notice when it is no longer in
a new stable release.
At that point there should be a removal reason better than
"maintainer who hadn't maintained the package for years
 suddenly decided to have it removed".
