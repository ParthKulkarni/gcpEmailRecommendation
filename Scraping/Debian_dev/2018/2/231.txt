  Description     : blockly plugin to enhance the package Aseba
 This package allows one to program small robots with the "blockly" approach,
 it enhances the package aseba.
 .
 Aseba is a lightweight virtual machine, small enough to run on
 any 16 bits microcontroller.  In Aseba, all virtual machines are
 linked in a network and all their programs are developed and debugged
 from a single application, Aseba Studio.
 .
 Aseba allows one to program Thymio, a small robot to discover the
 universe of robotics and learn a robot's language.
This package is relevant, in the non-free/devel section:
as the upstream developers distribute this blockly plugin for end-users which
drive their tiny robots Thymio under Linux, it may be useful to provide
this same feature for Debian users, without compelling them to run the
boldweight Google's Closure engine, which is used to build the application.
