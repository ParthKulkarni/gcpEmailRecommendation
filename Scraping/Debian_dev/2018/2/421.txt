Putting security support over all else is surely how some people see it. 
But some upstreams also complain if you are going to ship ancient 
versions because the most recent ones contain all of the fixes. It's 
certainly more work to validate security fixes when backporting them to 
older versions. So it's also the "stable" guarantee (whatever it is seen 
as) that might need some re-adjustment.
One of the values is that you get some set of software that works 
together as a base and doesn't change, but then people install software 
on top of it that provides their service and if it's actually the thing 
they want to provide it's most likely not packaged anymore at this 
point. Because you'd want the latest features of the product you're 
using. So there's already a disconnect of essentially two tracks: the 
system's base at a solid version and whatever it is you want to offer at 
a fast moving pace. That's also a reality in 2018. And coming up with 
arbitrary deadlines of support are not all that helpful. Users don't 
care if the ancient version of the software they need in stable is 
security supported until mid-2022. If it doesn't satisfy their 
requirements anymore, they move to testing or to another distribution.
