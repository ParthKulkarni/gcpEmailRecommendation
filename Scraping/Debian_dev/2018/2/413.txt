From https://backports.debian.org/FAQ/:
Q: Is there security support for packages from backports.debian.org?
A: Unfortunately not. This is done on a best effort basis by the people
who track the package, usually the ones who originally did upload the
package into backports. When security related bugs are fixed in Debian
unstable the backporter is permitted to upload the package from directly
there instead of having to wait until the fix hits testing. You can see
the open issues for jessie-backports in the security tracker (though
there may be false positives too, the version compare isn't perfect yet)
