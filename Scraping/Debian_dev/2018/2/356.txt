Sure, I don't see a problem with this.

Right, although merely technical since there is source code, albeit not
very legible or maintainable.

I might have missed the missing license problem, but I'm pretty noone
wants to see unlicensed software in Debian, which also would be
illegal.

This one really worries me. I wonder how many similar cases we already
have, where somebody took some code and changed it slightly before
including it.

The problem is probably less the amount but more the manual work to
find the canonical sources. Packing a go "library" for instance does
not take a lot of time, because it can be done mostly automated.
