That would be the "causing problems" part. Legally we may not be able to
redistribute it if there are copyright problems.

That sounds like an "important" bug to me, then. If the bug indeed does
not occur with other init systems, that means the package is not totally
useless.

If the package is not likely to be useful on s390x, then ask for the
removal of just the s390x binaries, and downgrade the bug severity. The
other example seems somewhat contrived and unlikely; I doubt such things
are actually a problem in practice.

[limited time]
I understand all that, and it does make sense. But Debian as a whole has
a limited amount of time for everything, and it makes sense to not get
distracted by things that nobody's interested in.
If you care about an orphaned package, and there's an RC bug, it doesn't
hurt you to say "I want to fix this bug so the package can migrate
again, but I don't have the time right now". That should be enough to
ensure people don't file removal bugs on it.
Finally, a removal isn't a way of saying "this package has no purpose
being in Debian". It's just a way of saying "we're sorry we couldn't fix
this package, but it seems unlikely". If you care enough, you can always
take the last version of the package, fix it, and reupload it. There's
no real reason why it wouldn't get through NEW.
