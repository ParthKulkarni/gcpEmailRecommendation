Right, covered too in:

Yeah. If we decided we wanted epochs present somehow in filenames
(#551323, for which I think I've got most code in some dpkg branch,
but I'd expect there are going to be tons of things assuming filename
patterns in external tools), we'd still need to decide first how and
if to encode it, and second when to encode it. As you say, we can
consider to add the epoch to the upstream tarball or not; because in
the end that's a Debian specific construction in the same way as our
revisions.
If upstream is releasing different content using the same version, then,
well, this so broken I'm not sure it's worth supported anyway. :)
The problem could have also been introduced by Debian, by using an
inexistent version that then upstream starts reusing, which IMO then
deserves a Debian-specific versioning scheme, such as +ds or similar.
The former can also be worked around this way. So I think it does make
sense to ignore epochs for orig tarballs.
This means we still could consider introducing epochs for the rest of
the filenames, .dsc, .changes, .deb, .diff.*, etc. The problem of course
is still *.debian.tar.*.
In any case, I agree with Colin that the problem here is with DAK
forgetfulness, because all filenames ever seen by DAK should be unique
and never contain different content regardless of the time frame.

We've already had this exact conversation before:
