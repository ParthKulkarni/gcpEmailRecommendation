I second this, for multiple reasons. If we go to a 'container capturing
a non-Debian build' approach we should always capture the sources
involved - for security tracking at least. e.g. Maven for Java seems to
be particularly bad at pulling JARs and other components randomly, often
over HTTP not HTTPS and without signatures, etc.  Gradle even does <pull
fragment of code from http:x and insert here> which is scary.
One step towards a fully proper Debian build and packaging is an 
infrastructure to at least capture all the sources involved in
containers and track them.

Commander Vimes didn’t like the phrase “The innocent have nothing to fear,”
 believing the innocent had everything to fear, mostly from the guilty but in the longer term
 even more from those who say things like “The innocent have nothing to fear.”
