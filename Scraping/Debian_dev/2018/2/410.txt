I don't know what's your point. You acknowledge we already ship not
security supported software. We could put a large dialog box when
installing/upgrading LibreOffice, like for other not security supported
software. Or we could put those software in a special repository (called
"unsupported"), a bit like backports that are not security supported
either.
Ubuntu does that since many years (everything in universe/multiverse is
unsupported) and nobody cares.
