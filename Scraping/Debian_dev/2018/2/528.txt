FTR, I'm not involved in CIP and thus I can't speak for them but since
I was in contact with them, I have looked at their wiki and you will
find their plans related to the kernel here:
https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/civilinfrastructureplatform/cipkernelmaintenance
And as you see, we have Debian people involved since Ben Hutching is
currently maintaining their "Super Long Term Support" kernel which is
based on Linux 4.4.
That said I'm not sure if their SLTS kernel will ever be suitable for
use in Debian. Maybe Ben can comment on this.
Cheers,
