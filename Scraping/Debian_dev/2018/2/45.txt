How would that help?
Example:
Subject: RM: hello -- RoM; obsolete
Control: affects -1 src:hello
For the few days or hours between the RM bug being filed and the
package actually being removed, this would show up at
  https://bugs.debian.org/src:hello
The chances of someone looking at this specific BTS page during the
short amount of time between it showing up there and the actual
removal are close to zero.

BTW: And then the next problem would be that the ftp team tends
     to ignore non-maintainer objections in RM bugs and removes
     the package anyway.
