Hello guys,
I encountered a weird situation where a package
doesn't migrate to testing:
  Assume source package "sA" yields binary
  package "bA" with Architecture=any. "sA"
  turns to be a valid candidate to migrate.
  Source package "sB" yields binary package
  "bB" with Architecture=all Depends=bA.
  Pakcage "sB" is not considered to migrate.
For instance, package lua-torch-xlua[3]
(= 0~20160719-g41308fe-4) is an Arch=all
package which depends on lua-torch-torch7
(arch=any). lua-torch-torch7 is shipped by
testing, but lua-torch-xlua doesn't migrate[4].
I tried to change Arch to any in the
0~20160719-g41308fe-5 upload to figure out
whether the missing of dependency in some
release architectures such as i386 caused
this situation, but the answer is no.
I cannot find useful information about testing
migration in policy[1]. Devref[2] listed some
conditions for a valid migration candidate.
However that doesn't explain what I encountered.
Does anyone known how to handle such situation?
Does devref need an update about migration?
A similar topic was sent to d-mentors by @olebole
a month ago but there was no response[5].
So I'm sending this to devel.
Thank you.
