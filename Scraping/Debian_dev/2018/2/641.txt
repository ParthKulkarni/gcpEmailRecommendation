  Description     : IrDA subsystem and device drivers
The IrDA subsystem and device drivers got moved to staging and scheduled for
removal upstream in Linux 4.14 [1] and consequently disabled in the Debian
builds [2].

As I personally do have a use case for IrDA and am sure that I am not the only
one, I moved the code (from 4.15; not compatible to 4.14!) into a GitHub
repository [3], converted the build system to Kbuild files, and added a DKMS
configuration and a Travis CI configuration to check the build with current
kernel releases.

I already prepared the packaging files. See [4] for copyright and license.
