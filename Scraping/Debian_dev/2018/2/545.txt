While I agree completely with your mail, Phil, I would add even more concerns
about the general usability of a distribution tailored for just a few target
users in terms of security support. I think other users (than the sponsors) of
this distribution should be warned very clearly about the specific and
restricted security support.
Since we (most probably) don't know at this stage which subset of all packages
will be supported it is really difficult to assess the benefit of this
distribution and if it can be recommended for general usage. Therefore I
would consider it finally better to not use the Debian infrastructure at least
for the distribution of these packages.
