rhkramer:
Intentionally cross posted. Aside: For those on the debian-user lists, 
the thread came from the debian-backports list, but my frustration 
should probably be expressed more to the debian-user list (or 
debian-developer list, assuming there is such a list (to which I am 
not subscribed). [...]
But the various names and use of those names gets very frustrating for 
me, and I suspect I am not the only one. The numbered versions, the 
Toy Story names, and then the testing, stable, old stable, old old 
stable is just frustrating.
Tangentially to that, it seems that someone needs to pick up the dropped 
baton and update the pictures.
