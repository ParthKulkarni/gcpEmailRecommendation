I was bitten by a similar issue; I maintained Drupal 7 for several
years (was included in 3 stable releases). But I gave up when
packaging Drupal 8, much for the same reasons:

However it saddens me, that's... Well, the right thing to do, IMO.

I would not like us relaxing our requirements. If there is a need to
distribute webapps as container images, that can be done, and much
probably it can be done by ourselves - But that's not Debian. That
means, distributing a container with dolibarr or with drupal8 will not
allow us to build packages that depend on them (such as
drupal7-mod-civicrm), or packaging helpers (such as
dh-make-drupal). Maybe few webapps introduce full ecosystems as Drupal
does; we had a similar issue a couple of years ago with OwnCloud, and
it would fall in the same case. And I think examples will be too many
to list.
