Hi!
The Debian GNOME team has continued working on removing obsolete GNOME
2 libraries and we wanted to provide an update on our progress and let
you know what's next.
We have identified the list of libraries we are targeting for removal
from Buster and have filed bugs for affected packages. Several
libraries have already been removed from Buster.
Soon, we intend to raise the severity of the remaining bugs to serious
to try to finish up these removals from Debian Testing.
Honestly, the best option for many of these packages is for them to be
ported to GTK3. If you are the maintainer for one of these packages
that is no longer maintained upstream and if you don't intend to port
it to deprecated libraries, you can help us out by filing a removal bug
for the package.
Thanks,
Jeremy Bicha
