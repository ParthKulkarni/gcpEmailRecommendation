  Description     : EDA layout and schematic package
 Electronic design package, covering the complete design flow from 
 schematic entry to gerber export. Includes interactive routing,
 rule-based DRC, 3D board layout, and a unified, netlist-aware, editor
 from symbol to board. The fundamental difference from KiCAD is the
 modern library management based around actual part IDs. It's a C++
 application that runs on Linux and Windows.
This is a fairly new package, presented at FOSDEM 2018. It is still
early in development, but it's already quite useable. It is an
alternative to KiCAD differentiated by fundamentally different choices
about library management.
I've packaged it in order to try it :-)
