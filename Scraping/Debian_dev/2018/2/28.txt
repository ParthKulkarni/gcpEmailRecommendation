I don't think it should be the sole decision of the maintainer to get
a package removed.
Like in the case at hand:
Last maintainer upload was in 2014.
Maintainer does nothing (including no action on a "new upstream release" 
                         bug from a user in 2014).
Maintainer files RM bug in 2018.
Why does the maintainer have the sole decision here?
The package would have been in a better state had it
been a QA-maintained orphaned package since 2014.

This works nicely, assuming the user who needs the package is a DD and 
notices immediately.
For normal users who are not following unstable the situation
is less rosy.
And if a normal user would notice immediately, what could he/she do?
Even an RFP to get a perfectly working package re-added just like it
was before the removal has close to zero chance of being acted on.
