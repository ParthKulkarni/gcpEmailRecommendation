 Description     : node builder tool for Doom-style games
ZDBSP is a node building-tool for Doom-style games, such as
Doom, Doom 2, Heretic, Hexen and Strife. Doom-style games
require "Nodes" (binary space partition trees) to be built for
custom maps. Compared to similar tools, ZDBSP is very fast.
ZDBSP generates the additional lumps required by GL engines.

I'd like there to be at least one BSP tool in the archive. At
the moment we have glbsp (which was orphaned and I have just
adopted) but I think we should switch to ZDBSP. I did some
performance comparisons, and on a particularly evil map ("choz"
from the WadC examples) and build time on my laptop dropped
from 4-ish minutes (glbsp) to sub-second.
I'll either maintain via collab-maint (Salsa Debian project)
or pkg-games.
