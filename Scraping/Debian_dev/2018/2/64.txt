I think it would be bad to move even more to a revolving door 
situation where we are adding packages to a stable release only
to remove them in the next stable release.
For users it is a problem when packages they use disappear in a new
stable release.

But RM is the wrong side to attack this problem.
Typically a removed package is not in a much worse shape when it got 
removed compared to when it was first shipped in a stable release.[1]
At that point the actual question is why we did allow the package
to be ITP'ed into Debian at all.
