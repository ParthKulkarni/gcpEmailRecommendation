Please don't get me wrong, that decision was a team decision done at the
spring (and I didn't even voted for it) - however I stand behind such team
decisions and follow them like they are my own. 
I think I owe you some reasoning. It was decided that relying again on a
service wouldn't be the best idea if the would have to move to some other
solution - the whole fun would start again. We also took into account that
the may be another implementation of a git service. We decided that the best
solution would be another new, authorative backend for guest users and dms,
that can work independently of the service. 
However, I hoped that someone else would take care about that new hypothetic
service/backend. Appearently that wasn't the case, until yesterday noone
expressed interest in *doing* the work. Therefore I decided that I should
take care about it and started the gsoc project (I even applied as admin to
ensure it will really happen). I also invited you to take part in the project
- the response wasn't very enthusiastic. 
I do really hope that we can have a good backend for guestuser and dm
authorisation and authentiction at the end of the summer. Something like
ud-ldap that can serve us for the next years. 
I still hope that you will join us in that mission.
