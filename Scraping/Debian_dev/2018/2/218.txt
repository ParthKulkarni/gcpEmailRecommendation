  Description     : carml is a command-line tool to query and control a running Tor
You can do things like:
        list and remove streams and circuits;
        monitor stream, circuit and address-map events;
        watch for any Tor event and print it (or many) out;
        monitor bandwidth;
        run any Tor control-protocol command;
        pipe through common Unix tools like grep, less, cut, etcetera;
        download TBB through Tor, with pinned certs and signature checking;
        ...even spit out and run xplanet configs (with router/circuit markers)!
It is written in Python and uses Tor's control-port via the txtorcon library.
- why is this package useful/relevant? 
  helps monitoring tor 
	
- if there are other packages providing similar functionality?
  no, there's txtorcon, which this package depends on
- how do you plan to maintain it? inside a packaging team? 
  maybe pkg-privacy
