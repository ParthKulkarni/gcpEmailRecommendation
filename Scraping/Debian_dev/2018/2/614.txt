Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I request assistance with maintaining the gnome-shell-extension-caffeine
package. It's currently unmaintained upstream, so if it stops working
in a future version of GNOME Shell and I'm not able to fix it, it'll
have to be removed. I can't commit to being able to take over upstream
maintenance myself.
The package description is:
 This GNOME Shell extension provides an icon which can be toggled to
 inhibit the actions that would normally be taken when the system is idle,
 including screen locking, screensaver and automatic suspend. By default
 it also inhibits idle actions while any window is full-screen, and it can
 be configured to inhibit idle actions while user-specified applications
 have any window open.
 .
 Please note that each user will need to enable the extension manually, for
 example using the gnome-tweaks application.
