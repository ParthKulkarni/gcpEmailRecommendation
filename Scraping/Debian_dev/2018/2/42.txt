But #871004 wasn't filed elsewhere - it spent a month as a non-RC bug
against Hyde itself.

The rc-alert tool in devscripts fits in this gap, it gives a list of
all open RC bugs against locally-installed packages, and the output
can be diffed with a VCS to see which bugs are newly added to the RC
list.
It wouldn't have spotted #871004, but having a policy of filing
"should this be removed?" bugs as RC would solve that. IMHO, it was
correct that the mass-bug-filing including #871004 wasn't RC, because
it would just lengthen the list of RC bugs against packages that
already have an RC bug.
