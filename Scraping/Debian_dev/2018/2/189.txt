Once again, I dispute that this is a bug in Ubuntu.  We just have
somewhat more stringent checks for duplicate file names, which any other
derivative or indeed dak itself might easily also have (indeed, dak does
check exactly this kind of thing, but has a shorter memory).

Simply jumping back to -12 seems perfectly reasonable; there's no need
for fake changelog entries.  There's no requirement to increment
versions one by one.
