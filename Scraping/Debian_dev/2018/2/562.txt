 These are in the early stages. We will try to maintain stability, but please
 vendor if you are relying on these directly.

 Contribute
 .
 This package may not cover all the use cases for btrfs. If something you need
 is missing, please don't hesitate to submit a PR.  .  Note that due to struct
 alignment issues, this isn't yet fully native.  Preferrably, this could be
 resolved, so contributions in this direction are greatly appreciated.
