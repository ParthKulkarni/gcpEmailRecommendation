I think the RM bug should include both what is being requested (removal)
and why.  I think the two are closely related enough that they should
share the title of "primary purpose".
However, I know that you and the rest of the FTP team do a tremendous
amount of work (thank you very much!), so I will concede that this is
one item that should be the responsibility of the bug filer and doesn't
need to be on your plate.

True, but that happens after the fact, and sometimes time has a way of
helping information to get lost.
