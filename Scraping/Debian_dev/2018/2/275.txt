  Description     : Mode S decoder specifically designed for RTLSDR devices
Main features:
 - Robust decoding of weak messages, with mode1090 many users observed
   improved range compared to other popular decoders.
 - Network support: TCP30003 stream (MSG5...), Raw packets, HTTP.
 - Embedded HTTP server that displays the currently detected aircrafts on
   Google Maps.
 - Single bit errors correction using the 24 bit CRC.
 - Ability to decode DF11, DF17 messages.
 - Ability to decode DF formats like DF0, DF4, DF5, DF16, DF20 and DF21 where
   the checksum is xored with the ICAO address by brute forcing the checksum
   field using recently seen ICAO addresses.
 - Decode raw IQ samples from file (using --ifile command line switch).
 - Interactive command-line-interfae mode where aircrafts currently detected
   are shown as a list refreshing as more data arrives.
 - CPR coordinates decoding and track calculation from velocity.
 - TCP server streaming and receiving raw data to/from connected clients
   (using --net).
For now, I intend to maintain this myself under my salsa namespace. In the
future this will likely be moved to a team who might share interest with
this package.
