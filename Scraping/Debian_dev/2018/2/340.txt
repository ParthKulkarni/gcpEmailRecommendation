Which is where Debian (and other distributions which care about
freeness, security, etc.) has lost relevance for these use cases. And I
see a lot of growth in the use of this stuff, to the point that I wonder
who will still care about the underlying distributions: will young
developers really care about the ground?
I see more and more READMEs on github telling to just use pip install or
such, the host distribution is basically only used to provide a python
interpreter and/or container host.
