Sigh.
Indeed he had no reason to bump the epoch.
He couldn't see solutions, but the truth is that all he had to do was to
switch to 3.0 (quilt) with the -12 upload and clean up its sources.
moon-buggy_1.0.51.orig.tar.gz had never been uploaded, and even if it
was the epoch would have not allowed him to replace it as the upstream
version doesn't change with epoch changes.
This is one of the many situations where I'd like developers to *ask*
when unsure or uncertain of something.
So, in fact, the epoch bump was totally useless, and as it often happens
in those cases, it's causing headaches for somebody.

Well, for sure bumping -1 â†’ -12 is ugly...

I agree this is an Ubuntu issue with their infrastructure.
Have you tried asking the ubuntu archive admins, maybe they could get it
through manually?

Please don't consider the Debian Policy like a stick.  Or a all-kwowing
never-wrong oracle.

If I were the maintainer, I'd just bump the version to get it through
LP, but I'm biased as I'm also a Ubuntu developer.
Otherwise, just manually merge it, doing the 1.0 native â†’ 3.0 quilt move
properly?  Just that then the version are not going to match anymore for
a long while, and MoM is surely going to be confusedâ€¦
