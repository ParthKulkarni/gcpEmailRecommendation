I don't know where you got figures to support this case, but I have the
inverse feeling (and no figures either). Arch is taking away our desktop
users, Ubuntu is taking away our cloud users, Alpine is taking away our
container users and CoreOS/Atomic Host are taking away users interested
by container orchestration solutions.
