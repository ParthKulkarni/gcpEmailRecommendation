I wonder where this representation of "epoch" as a "stigma" comes from.
They're a part of a version number. They're as much a stigma as the "57"
in "libavcodec57". What's the big deal? Just use it if you need to, and
be done with it.
There's really really really nothing wrong with using an epoch. If some
of our (or someone else's) infrastructure has issues dealing with them,
then that's a bug in the infrastructure and we should fix it. But nobody
should be afraid of using an epoch when the upstream version number
changes incompatibly, because *that's what they're for*.
Jeez.
