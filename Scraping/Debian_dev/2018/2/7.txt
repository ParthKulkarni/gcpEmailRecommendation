Except that apparently the OP is complaining about removing a package
with RC bugs open for 3+ years with nobody caring enough to notice them
and *triaging* (as apparently one was even already fixedâ€¦) them.
I seriously doubt ITRs or somesuch would help, you wouldn't notice them
anyway.
If you can parse a list of ITRs you can equally easy parse a list of
packages with open RC bugs with next to the same effect.
RoQA packages without RC bugs is very rare (and I don't like them
myself), and ROM shouldn't be second guessed anyway (as an ftpteam
member stated).
(btw, many removals requested by Moritz Muehlenhoff are marked RoQA but
really are RoST (but did that acronym disapper from the list?!), and
that covers a bunch of of the "orphaned pkg removed despite no rc bug")
