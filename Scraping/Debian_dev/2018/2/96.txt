Please don't sent RFS requests to debian-devel; the proper list is
debian-mentors.  Also, a mere mail tends to be forgotten unless acted upon
immediately, please file a bug instead.  Just:
[~]$ reportbug sponsorship-requests
which will DTRT.
(Not needed this time -- your package looks good; in NEW.)

There's a separate team set up for themes:
https://salsa.debian.org/groups/desktop-themes-team
which you even have already joined.
You may consider moving the VCS for this package to this team.

Done!
