I very much disagree that Debian is loosing relevance, like many software 
projects Debian usage is still growing. and other projects grow as well. 
Debian was just again voted best linux distro by linux journal. Debian
(and other traditional distros) surely lost relevance in the "web
hosting plattform" "niche" but even there, in numbers we're still
growing. just container based solutions are much more popular today and
they ease installing crap^wstrange bundles.

you can use their package managers, and thus these features, on Debian
today. there's also docker containers and other options if you want to
use bundled "stuff".
