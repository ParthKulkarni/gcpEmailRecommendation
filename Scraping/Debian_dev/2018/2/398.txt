It seems like you're not reading what other people have said--tt has

stable base of software that interoperates. A collection of unrelated 
independent modules which must be dynamically built off the latest git 
repository may be interesting, but it's not a coherent distribution. 
Other people are already trying to do that thing, it isn't clear what 
value debian would add. Conversely, we know what the current debian 
distribution provides, why throw that out to chase some new shiny thing?
