Dunno.
As a sysadmin, I know I can trust that most of my system is OK if I
just apt update / apt upgrade every so often. And I know the maybe
five to ten software packages I have hand-installed. I know I must be
aware of their alerts and whatnot.
I know that being a 15-year DD does not make me the average
sysadmin. But that's one of Debian core values to sysadmins. I guess
I'm not the only one appreciating that.
