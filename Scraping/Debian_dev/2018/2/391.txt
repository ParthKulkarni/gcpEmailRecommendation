Hi Sean,

please have a look at for example CVE-2017-18077 [1] in the security 
tracker. This CVE affects one little JavaScript library and is marked as 
<unimportant>. There is also a note attached, saying: "nodejs not covered 
by security support"
Basically all other CVEs for node-modules are marked as <unimportant> as 
well. So we do track all Javascript issues, but we don't create DSAs for 
them and don't include them in point releases (as you can see for example 
in CVE-2016-1000236 [2][3][4]).
Other javascript libraries like libjs-* and *.js even don't get a CVE. So 
either they are secure or nobody cares.
From a security manpower point of view, there is no difference whether we 
have hundreds of little JavaScript libraries in only one or in multiple 
versions.
