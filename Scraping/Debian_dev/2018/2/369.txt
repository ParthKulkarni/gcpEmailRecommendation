It's not "without source code", it's just that the source code of a single
.min.js is not another non-minified javascript file but a whole git
repository that you can't just drop near the .min.js file to please lintian.
And building ourselves the non-minified file together with the corresponding
minified file is just too time-consuming on the long term when you rely on
dozens of libraries.
