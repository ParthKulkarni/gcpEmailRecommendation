  Description     : http.Agent for having keepalive mode in http requests
 http.Agent for having keepalive mode in http requests
 .
 The Node.js's missing keep alive http.Agent. It supports http and https.
 .
 What's different from original http.Agent?
  *keepAlive=true by default
  *Disable Nagle's algorithm: socket.setNoDelay(true)
  *Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the
   free-sockets queue.
  *Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the
   active-sockets queue.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 .
 This package is a useful dependancy of NPM 5.0
 .
 I am planning to maintain this package as part of a javascript
maintainers team.
 Pirate Praveen has agreed to sponser this package.
