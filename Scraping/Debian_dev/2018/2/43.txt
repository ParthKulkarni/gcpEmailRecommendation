Currently, RM bugs are filed against ftp.debian.org.
It might make sense to have them filed against ftp.debian.org *and* the
package to be removed, instead. That way, people who care about the
package are more likely to see that it is about to be removed, and can
take corrective action if they don't want to have that happen?
I don't think a package that is orphaned, has long-standing RC bugs
against it, and hasn't been in a released version of Debian for a long
time requires much consideration before being removed, however. Those
are cruft, and we should get rid of them...
