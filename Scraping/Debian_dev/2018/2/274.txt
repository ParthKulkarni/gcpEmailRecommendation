  Description     : Pure Java implementation of the NaCl: Networking and Cryptography library
 jnacl is a library that implements some of Daniel J. Bernstein's NaCl
 encryption primitives. The functions are written in pure Java, and are
 therefore very straight-forward to make use of in a Java application
 without the use of native libraries and bindings.
 
 The following primitives are included:
 
 - curve25519: Elliptic curve key agreement
 - salsa20: Stream cipher
 - poly1305: Message authenticator (MAC)
 It is open-source and available on GitHub.
 
 Even though it has not been comprehensively benchmarked, jnacl performs
 exceptionally well, even on resource-constrained Android platforms.
This package will be maintained by the Debian Java Team.
This library is a new dependency required to update jeromq.  Note that
the upstream author hasn't tagged releases in [0], therefore the
packaging will track the releases of this fork [1].
