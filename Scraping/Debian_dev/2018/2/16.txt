That would be redundant, merely a yet another stage that's not really
needed.
RFA/O are about whether there's someone willing to do the work, without
a message about the package being useful or not.
ITR (or an usertag) would be a query if the package is useful, with no
statement about whether you're willing to do the work or not.
Ie, there's no "somebody take over", as you may be okay with keeping the
package -- you no longer need it yourself, but can continue maintaining it,
as long as there are actual users who care.

I wouldn't want to spam the FTP team with a thousand of RMs they're not
supposed to handle yet.
