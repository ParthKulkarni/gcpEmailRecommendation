Which would mean that in that case, the dependency should not be
declared as "X (>= *:1.8)", but instead as "X (>= 1:1.8)".
(We might at some point discover that we want to update the whole scheme
so it also supports "X (>= [1-*]:1.8)" to cover a combination of the two
cases that you and I just described, but really?)
