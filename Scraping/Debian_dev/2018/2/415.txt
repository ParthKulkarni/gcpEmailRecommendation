I don't see where is the confusion. There is no security support. It's
written verbatim. This doesn't mean there is no security update, but
these updates are pushed on a best effort basis.
Moreover, backports do not accept security patches. You can only push a
version in testing (or unstable). Notably, if the version in testing is
not easily backportable (because of new dependencies), you may wait
quite some time before you get a security update.
