Also? What was not true? The Debian Backports FAQ?
The exception you mention is not documented. It is also likely to just be

 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-roundcube-maintainers/2017-November/002070.html
And the backport team has been pretty clear this is not the right way to
maintain backports:
