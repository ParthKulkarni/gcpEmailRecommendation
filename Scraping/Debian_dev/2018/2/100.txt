  Description     : Peer To Peer Chat
Provides peer-to-peer chat classes and two applications 
(AWT- and console-based)
This library (albeit being abandonware) would be needed for VASSAL engine 
integration, where it's used in unit tests.
I'm going to maintain it by myself, not much of activity is spotten on
the upstream.
