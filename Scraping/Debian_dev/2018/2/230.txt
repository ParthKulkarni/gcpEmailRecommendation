  Description     : adapter trimmer for Oxford Nanopore reads
Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford
Nanopore reads. Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and
when a read has an adapter in its middle, it is treated as chimeric
and chopped into separate reads. Porechop performs thorough alignments
to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence identity.
Porechop also supports demultiplexing of Nanopore reads that were
barcoded with the Native Barcoding Kit, PCR Barcoding Kit or Rapid
Barcoding Kit.
More information and download links are on the Porechope repo:

The package is relevant to the field of genome assembly and will be
maintained by the Debian Med team.
