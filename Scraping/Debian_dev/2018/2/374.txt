I should have been more specific.  What I was suggesting was that
providing a repository of containers/flatpaks/whatever would enable us
to provide different versions of libraries which would not receive
security support.
By having them in flatpaks/etc. we would mitigate somewhat the need for
this security support, and also draw a clear line between "this is the
stuff that we provide security support for" and "this is the stuff we
don't, but we've wrapped it up so it's a bit safer".
