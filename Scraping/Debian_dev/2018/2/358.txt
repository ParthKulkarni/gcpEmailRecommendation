I disagree, it is not maintainable source code, yes, but source code
nonetheless. According to wikipedia source code is:
In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions,
possibly with comments, written using[1] a human-readable programming
language, usually as plain text.
I guess minified source code does qualify. However, this discussion is
mood since the bigger lies in the modules that get included without any
real documentation.

Agreed this is ugly and I'm all in if we can find a better solution.
but just not having all these applications does not strike me as a
better solution.

I get your point, I just don't accept the consequence that we should
not package these applications.
