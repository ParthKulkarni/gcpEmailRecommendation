tar will treat a filename with : in it as a command to connect to a remote
machine via rsh and execute /etc/rmt remotely:
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_127.html
The git repo shows that GNU tar had --force-local in 1994 (f_force_local):
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=d3fdd8259b1dd0e5ec05d1540b10d2deba7cc864
Perhaps not using colons in filenames directly comes from not wanting to
require --force-local on every single tar invocation for decades to come?
