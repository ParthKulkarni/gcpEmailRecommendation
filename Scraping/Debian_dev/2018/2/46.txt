I think we are going to modify the pending removals page to indicate which 
requests are recent or have recent activity on the bug.  I think that will put 
at least a little cushion in.  As the FTP team member processing most of the 
rm bugs recently, what I mostly want is to have to touch the bug once.  Once 
there's a visual indication it should be left to ripen for now, I'll be glad 
to do that.

If in the maintainer's opinion it's better to remove the package than to leave 
it in the archive unmaintained, I think this is generally appropriate (see my 
previous mentions about not thinking FTP team should second guess 
maintainers).  The one exception is if a non-maintainer objects to a removal 
and the objection includes them saying they will take over maintenance.  Of 
course that almost never happens.
