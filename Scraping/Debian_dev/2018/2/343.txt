That's not a good justification for doing something if it doesn't fit

In the current world Debian[1] has an 8 digit userbase on the
Raspberry Pi.
These are existing Debian users, and the Raspberry Pi ecosystem
is culturally much closer to Debian than the JS universe.
If you (or anyone else) wants to spend effort on attracting new people 
to maintain Debian, the Raspberry Pi ecosystem would be the more
logical choice here.
