Ubuntu can use epochs.  Neither Debian nor Ubuntu can have two deb files
that generate the same filename (which doesn't include the epoch).
There isn't really a difference here except that Ubuntu breaks more
obviously and earlier, whereas such packages seem like they work in Debian
but then break other tools outside of DAK that expect filenames to be
unique.
