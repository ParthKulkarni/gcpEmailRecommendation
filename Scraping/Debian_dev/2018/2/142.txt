I was thinking it might be better to go to a "wildcard" epoch:
Depends: X (>= *:1.8)
would mean
"For this comparison, ignore the epoch, and make sure that the version
is at least 1.8 or above".
Beyond that, the usual semantics of all the operators would apply. No
need for "special" operators or metadata format changes.
I was thinking for a moment that it might be useful to have that
implemented as a "general" thing, but then I cannot think of any
situation where a dependency of the form "any version of this package,
as long as it has a Debian revision of 2 or above" might be useful.
Given that, it might also be good to state that wildcard version
comparisons may not include the debian revision, only the upstream
version number.
