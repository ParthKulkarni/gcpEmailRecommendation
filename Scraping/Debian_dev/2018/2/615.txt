Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I request assistance with maintaining the
gnome-shell-extension-top-icons-plus package. It's currently unmaintained
upstream, so if it stops working in a future version of GNOME Shell
and I'm not able to fix it, it'll have to be removed. I can't commit to
being able to take over upstream maintenance myself.
The package description is:
 This GNOME Shell extension alters how the Shell displays freedesktop.org
 system tray icons (status icons, notification-area icons). In the upstream
 GNOME Shell code, these icons appear in a small pop-out panel in the
 bottom left corner of the screen; this extension moves them to the
 top bar, between the clock and system menu.
 .
 Please note that each user will need to enable the extension manually, for
 example using the gnome-tweaks application.
