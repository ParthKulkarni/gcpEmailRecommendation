  Description     : Reset Password extension (Request Tracker)
 This extension allows users to get a reset password link in Request Tracker.
RT doesn't come out of the box with an ability for users to reset their
passwords if they forget them, or if they aren't set. This extension
adds that ability.
The intial packaging work has been carried but by myself for my employer.
Ongoing maintenance will be by the Debian Request Tracker Group (of which
I'm a member).
