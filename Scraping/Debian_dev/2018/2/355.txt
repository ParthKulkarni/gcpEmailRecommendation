Depends how it would be done. Nixos style would probably very
difficult for Debian. Packages with version number in their
name would be no packaging problem at all, but we would have
to make clear, that security support is not likely.

Is was a relevant part of the problem mentioned in Raphaels bug
report: Minified JS libraries without source code. this was one
of the starting points of this discussion. (#890598)
The bug report mentions two orthogonal problems:
 - libraries without source code or no license information
 - libraries which are needed in specific versions
I add a third one:
 - libraries that are not packaged, because there are too many
