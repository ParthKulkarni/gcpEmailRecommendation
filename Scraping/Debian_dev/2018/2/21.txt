Oh wow, I didn't realize x3270 got removed. :(
As a user I'd be deeply disappointed by that removal bug because it has
zero context. I do feel like there should be at least some. It's fine to
say "RoM, dead upstream". But to provide literally no reason is not.
I agree that you shouldn't second-guess, but I think you can at least
enforce some comment to be present. As someone who now ponders to
re-introduce the package I have zero context as well as to why the
package got removed and if it's sensible to re-introduce it in the first
place.
(Note that nothing here is intended to assign some kind of personal blame.)
Kind regards
