Me too likes to extend the removal notice for few weeks/months.
Especially removal from testing when outside freeze periods.
Packages removed from testing outside of the freeze can be easily
re-added to testing once the underlying RC bugs are fixed. So RMs
should
continue to remove early, and remove often. [When this has happened
with
my packages (see lilypond), it's resulted in more people helping with
the maintenance of them, and brought some issues to a wider
audience.]
I agree. Removals from testing should have no artifical delay. Removals
from the archive (i.e. unstable), a two or four week courtesy delay
seems ok to me, giving the person listed in Maintainers a chance to
reply, seems ok.
So far, every time this comes up, there's no actual volunteer to invest the time to update the removals page to make this reasonable to do in practice.
I think some normal delay is reasonable, but it needs to be integrated into the pending removals page so the FTP team member processing removals gets an indication the request is new.
