Can't we treat a .deb file like a container in the sense that it may
include additional source if needed? I'd very much like this.
I know that this does create some problems for us, e.g. on the security
side, but the alternative is, as you mentioned, manually installed
software and that surely is worse.
Maybe we should restrict this approach to areas where this problem is
very common, like javascript? At least initially.
