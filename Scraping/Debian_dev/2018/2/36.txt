I'm sure they are - *many* RC bugs are trivial to fix. That doesn't
necessarily make them the best use of our limiting resource: volunteer
time/attention/motivation. If I could spend an hour fixing trivial RC
bugs in undermaintained packages with few users (and trying to work out
how to smoke-test the result to make sure I'm not uploading something
fundamentally broken, which is usually the more time-consuming part),
or alternatively I could spend 10 minutes proposing their removal
and spend the rest of the hour fixing non-RC bugs in widely-relied-on
packages like dbus or GNOME, I suspect the latter is going to have a
larger impact on the quality of Debian.
If you disagree (different people have different priorities), there are
plenty of unmaintained or undermaintained packages you could pick up.
