Why would it be? You're always allowed to open a bug with "serious"
severity under the "in the opinion of the maintainer, this bug is
problematic enough to warrant RC-ness" definition. I've occasionally
used that to prevent a package of mine from migrating to testing for a
few days, even though there wasn't anything RC-wrong with it as such.
"I don't think this package is as useful anymore as it once was, and we
should get rid of it" sounds like a perfectly valid use of the "serious"
severity to me.
