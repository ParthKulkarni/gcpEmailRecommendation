debian/copyright points to http://aolserver.sf.net/ where the latest news
item is about it being copied to github in 2010.
https://github.com/aolserver/aolserver got its latest commit in 2009.
This looks fairly dead to me, and unless its maintainer knows better, I
don't think there is going to be any upstream security support.
It has also not been uploaded since an NMU that went into stretch, so
if it's removed from unstable, it will be trivial for prospective users
or maintainers to retrieve it from stretch.
If you want to keep this package around in Debian, please close this bug.
If not, please send the following commands to control@bugs.debian.org,
replacing nnnnnn with this bug's number:
severity nnnnnn normal
reassign nnnnnn ftp.debian.org
retitle nnnnnn RM: aolserver4 -- RoQA; unmaintained upstream, alternatives exist, low popcon
thanks
(or replace RoQA with RoM if you are the maintainer)
