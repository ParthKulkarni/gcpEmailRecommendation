The software might integrate properly into Debian - and allow everyone 
on the internet to take control of your computer.
On the server side we are talking about software like Node.js or gitlab.
On the desktop side the MUA that comes with our default desktop renders
HTML emails using a web engine that is not security supported by Debian.
An example what "no security support" means in practice:
If you are running Debian stable and haven't yet installed the
LibreOffice security updates Debian published a few days ago,
then opening a document is sufficient to make LibreOffice silently
send your gpg and ssh private keys to whatever server the author
of that document wants - no dialog, no warnings, you won't notice.
If Debian would provide LibreOffice without security support,
how many of our users would have been aware of this problem?
