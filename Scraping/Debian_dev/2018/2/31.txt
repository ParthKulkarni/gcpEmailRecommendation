My point is: who decides.  Raising objections absent actually doing work isn't 
particularly helpful.  I did already mention that we plan to change the 
removals page to indicate which rm bugs have recent activity so we can give 
them a pass, so it's safe to stop asking for the FTP team do that.  It's in 
the plan.

Yes.  Don't introduce them into Debian.  Every package introduced causes work 
for volunteers.  If you  don't think it's worth having in stable eventually, 
then I don't think it belongs in Debian.  If you know you aren't going to take 
care of it, it's an imposition on the rest of the project that's impolite at 
best.

Could be.  I've seen plenty of packages that are really maintained by NMU, but 
I don't think that's germane.  There was a rm bug filed in the last day or two 
about a package where the web service it connected to no longer worked with 
the package due to API changes and the maintainer said he was not able to keep 
up with the package anymore.  That kind of package is pointless in the archive 
without someone to watch over it.
Some unmaintained packages are fine as QA maintained and some aren't as I 
already said.

This is a slightly different type of problem.  Removals are eminently 
reversible.

Somewhere in this thread someone managed to whine about removal of a package 
that had already missed multiple releases.

If their metapackage were in the archive, it would have shown up as 
problematic.

I agree (and already said), that would be better and anyone who cares is 
welcome to ask the maintainer why they thought it should be removed and 
document it.
Of course one way to get longer to between when the rm is filed and when the 
removal is done is long, rambling, 80% pointless d-devel threads like this.  
I've been spending the time I would be doing FTP team work this week writing 
d-devel emails instead.
