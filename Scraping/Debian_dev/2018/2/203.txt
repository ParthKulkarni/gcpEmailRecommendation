I don't actually know much about debconf, sorry. I just followed what 
debhelper is doing, but it appears you need to add that check with 
DEBCONF_RECONFIGURE, otherwise a dpkg-reconfigure will always be a NOP 
(because defaults and defaults-disabled become NOPs when the service is 
already enabled or disabled).
