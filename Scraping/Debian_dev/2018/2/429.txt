I don't understand how this connects to what I, and others, were
saying. Nobody ever suggested to leave users in the dark, we talked
about documenting very clearly what they get and what they don't.
Besides my personal experience is that most people do not set up the
infrastructure you mentioned so they get caught unaware no matter what.
