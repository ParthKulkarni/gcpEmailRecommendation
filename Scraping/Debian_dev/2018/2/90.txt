  Description     : two-player board game with randomness
 El-Ixir is a board game that has apparently been invented by Isoft in 1981,
 released as a booter floppy.  This is a quite faithful remake, like the
 original using text-mode graphics.
 .
 Every turn, players are presented with four random squares they can place
 a block on.  The object of the game is to connect as many blocks to the
 board's corners as you can, possibly “embracing” areas while doing so.
Just a thingy I made in 1990.  Probably a curses-like same-computer
interface won't make it popular today, now that everyone expects to tap a
phone even if the opponent sits next to you -- but there are stronger
contenders for the title of the crappiest package in the archive.
And those of us whose beards are grey enough know how to use a shared
tmux for remote play.
