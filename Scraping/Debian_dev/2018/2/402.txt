In the year 2018, any kind of "properly maintain" includes security support.
Please elaborate how Debian can provide security support for packages 
like gitlab and all their dependencies in buster until mid-2022.
If Debian cannot provide security support for the lifetime of a stable 
Debian release, it is better for our users when they are installing the
software from upstream with the security support provided by upstream.
