Sure. But as a packager, I don't want to have to do this manually. So
one possible idea might be to extend our copyright file format. We should
be able to put there the URL for the sources of something that has been
embedded in the application and some debian.org service would ensure that
we keep a publicly-accessible copy of all those sources for as long as we
want them.
BTW we could also rely on our copyright file to document the fact that we
have vendored copies of some software.
Cheers,
