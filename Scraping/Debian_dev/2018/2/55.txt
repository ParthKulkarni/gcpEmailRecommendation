I'd say we want to _increase_ the speed of removals.  Less cruft is good: if
a package is in hopeless state, shipping it is a disservice to the users.
However, a package being orphaned doesn't make it a lot less functional: an
user who's a DD or contributor, will fix it the moment it gets problematic
for his particular use case -- and conversely, no one gives flying carnal
knowledge about "a file in the testsuite has bad license" or "might cause
data loss on unclean shutdown on ext2 in an unusual configuration".
If it's orphaned+RC-buggy but it Works For Me‚Ñ¢, it's good to stay, right?
Thus, mere orphaning doesn't seem to be a good marker, especially for non-DD
users.
