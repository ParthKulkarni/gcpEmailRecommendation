Every change that gets published as DSA or part of a stable update gets 
automatically installed on millions of machines.

Sometimes that is true and sometimes it is not.
And what are the latest features today will likely be included in the 
version in the next Debian stable.
The main question is what Debian can offer throughout the distribution.
Installing some or few (open source or proprietary) products on top of 
the distribution is often required for various reasons.
If Debian ships an older version of one of these products that is not
a problem.
What is a problem is if such a 3rd party product suddenly breaks due
to an update in the stable distribution, or becomes vulnerable due to
unfixed CVEs in the stable distribution.

Let's make a real-life example:
salsa.debian.org and gitlab.
salsa currently runs a manually installed gitlab.
At some point after the release of buster salsa is expected to be
upgraded to buster.
If buster ships a gitlab package with no security support from Debian, 
would you recommend that Debian uses this package on salsa until 
bullseye gets released?
If buster ships a gitlab package that is supported by Debian by every 
once in a while upgrading to the latest upstream gitlab, would you 
recommend that Debian uses this package on salsa instead of continuing
to use a manually installed gitlab?
Even if gitlab would have been part of stretch it is clear that salsa 
wouldn't use the version in stretch. The "ancient version of the 
software" in buster will likely be recent enough for salsa, but for
such a central and exposed service security support and no regressions
are also important.
