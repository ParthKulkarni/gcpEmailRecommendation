  Description     : Cross-browser extension to detect and download media resources
Bulk Media Downloader is a browser extension (add-on) to detect all media
(video, audio and image) sources by monitoring network activities. In oppose
to the other similar extensions, Bulk Media Downloader has zero impact on your
browser performance when the grabber window is closed. To grab a media, open
the Media Tools window and refresh the browser tab that has the intended
resource and wait for the resource to be fetched by browser one more time. You
can use filters to declutter resources area and you can bulk download resources
by selecting multiple items at once.
This will replace some extensions for firefox that no longer work and will be
maintained inside the pkg-mozext group.
