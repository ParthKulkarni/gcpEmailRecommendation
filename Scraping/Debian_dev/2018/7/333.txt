It's not an "uncomfortable reference to (a) part of (the) human body".
It's a wholly inappropriate reference to a part of the *female* body
often associated with sex, which therefore is a mysogynistic and
demeaning reference to women.

not for matters of (bad) taste.

Nobody is suggesting that we rename a person, we only suggest to rename
binaries and/or a package. Therefore this is not being pushed too far,
and your tangent is irrelevant.
