Well, upstream has chosen these names. Besides from the fact that the 
project and its applications are known by these names (how would you tag 
the package, so that someone who knows the project would find the right 
package with apt or apt-file?) it has something to do with politeness (in 
my opinion). If you wish to package the work of others you should use the 
right names (we donâ€™t have any name clash).
If you have a problem with the names but upstream doesnâ€™t (it seems to be 
a Frensh project, even with female developpers), youâ€™re free to drop the 
package. Or, as Marvin Renich noted, you can fork the project. Then you 
can do as you please as long as you do the work. Then time will tell if 
you win the users of the old project.
