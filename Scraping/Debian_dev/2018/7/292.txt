Agreed, we should ensure all fixes are in all versions and I'd be glad

Upstream agreed to fix the referenced problem without discussing, which 
is encouraging.
So we should check the messages further and report them to have them 
fixed if any other insult slipped through.
You're welcome to try convincing them. They were clear they did not want 
to rename but maybe they could agree on having a variant of the binaries 
along with the original ones.
I also like the idea of a single binary with subcommands, would be 
easier than remembering all the commands.
But as I said unless upstream does agree on something, we're not going 
to maintain an alternate version.
