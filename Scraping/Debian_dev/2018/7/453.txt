--------
I apologize if this is a dup -- I've been experiencing problems trying 
to post to this mailing list.
I have been trying to find out if it's possible to escape the /cow 
chroot set up by the casper init scripts when one boots into a Debian 
based Linux live-CD/DVD. I want to know how to access the /cow/upper 
overlayfs directory for a live session that was booted _without_ the 
persistent option. Is there any way to do this? I've tried many 
different suggestions from the web but none have helped.
Any help or suggestions would be appreciated...
Thanks,
Jonathan
