  Programming Lang: Ruby
  Description     :  provides the methods of an IO object based upon
on a few simple methods provided by the including class:
unbuffered_read, unbuffered_write, and unbuffered_seek. These methods
provide the underlying read, write, and seek support respectively, and
only the method or methods necessary to the correct operation of the
IO aspects of the including class need to be provided. Missing
functionality will cause the resulting object to appear read-only,
write-only, and/or unseekable depending on which underlying methods
are absent. Additionally, read and write operations which are buffered
in IO are buffered with independently configurable buffer sizes.
Duplexed objects (those with separate read and write streams) are also
supported.
This ruby gem is part of dependency chain of rails 5
I want to maintain this as part of ruby team
