This attempt to manufacture excuses for upstream is absurd.
There is a ton of context here, both from the imagery on the upstream web
site and the other program names in the package.  It's completely obvious
that the word "boob" is referring to female anatomy, and the rest of the
package is an extended riff on that joke.
You can certainly disagree about how important that is or what impact it
might have, but let's at least be honest about the obvious intent.  Not
the slightest hint of mind reading is required.
