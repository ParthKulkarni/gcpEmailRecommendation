  Description     : Fully interactive, realtime, and modern text-based browser
If you only have a 3kbps internet connection tethered from a phone, then
it's good to SSH into a server and browse the web through, say, elinks.
That way the server downloads the web pages and uses the limited
bandwidth of an SSH connection to display the result. However,
traditional text-based browsers lack JS and all other modern HTML5
support. Browsh is different in that it's backed by a real browser,
namely headless Firefox, to create a purely text-based version of web
pages and web apps. These can be easily rendered in a terminal or
indeed, ironically, in another browser.
.
Browsh can also use MoSH to further reduce bandwidth and increase
stability of the connection. Mosh offers features like automatic
reconnection of dropped or roamed connections and diff-only screen
updates.
The packaging will require some time as many dependencies are missing.
I plan to maintain it within the Go packaging team.
