It would be good if women involved in the Debian project would speak up 
here. Of course I understand any hesitance to do so. I felt hesitance 
myself often enough, even as what is usually called male.
What would be required to help women to feel more comfortable to post 
their opinion on this mailing list? I think it would be beneficial for 
the project to improve the current situation, to make clear that women 
are welcome. I see the project as the people in the projectâ€¦ everyone 
can contribute.
I bet most of the hesitance is due to bad experiences of women in the 
past. I do not recall any situation on this list, but I only read a very 
small part of it. So there may be some I either do not remember or did 
not read. Past experiences do not need to determine the present moment. 
There are in the past already.
It is in collective consciousness of our so called civilized western 
societies (and likely many other societies as well). So what concrete 
steps would help to start shifting that in the direction of more respect 
between the different genders?
In the end we are all human beings or expressions of the same one 
consciousness in different soul-mind-bodies.
Ciao.
