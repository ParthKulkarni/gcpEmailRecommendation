Seems you elaborated only that it is ridiculously slow so use CPUs 
instead of [non-free blob'ed] GPUs - not that it is *impossible to use 
CPUs.
If I am mistaken and you addressed the _possibility_ (not popularity) of 
reproducing/modifying/researching with CPUs, then I apologize for 
missing it, and as if you can please highlight the the essential part of 
your point.
Bill Gates is famously quoted for ridiculing the need for more than 640 
kilobytes of memory in personal computers.  Computer designs changed 
since then.
