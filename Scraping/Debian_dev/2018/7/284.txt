Remove libcrypt from glibc first, with a dependency on a libxcrypt that 
replaces it. I don't think it's safe to try as a diversion. You could 
maybe have fun with symlinks (see the /bin/sh saga) if you wanted to be 
able to switch back and forth, but if libcrypt is really leaving glibc 
there wouldn't seem to be any point to that.
