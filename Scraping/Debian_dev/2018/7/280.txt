Given that this new package is going to replace a part of glibc, it
will need to behave as if it was part of the pseudo-Essential package
set. When it comes to the diversion that means it needs to be added
*without* the rename, so that we always have the libcrypt.so.1 present.
But otherwise why would it be broken?

This one is tied to the major.minor glibc version, so I think you
should just ignore it. I'd expect at most glibc itself to perhaps rely
on it, anything else using it would not be very sane IMO.
