  Description     : Cell based view for text terminals
 Package tcell provides a cell based view for text terminals, like xterm.
 It was inspired by termbox, but differs from termbox in some important
 ways. It also adds substantial functionality beyond termbox.
This is a depdendency of browsh (ITP #904132).
The package will be maintained in the Go team.
