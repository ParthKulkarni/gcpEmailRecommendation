it is used to some extent. E.g. the python interpreter packages are built using 
PGO/LTO optimization on some architectures, and some upstreams support building 
using PGO as well.  You need to find some way to create the profile data, which 
usually requires some extra packaging work.  There is also autofdo, using a more 
general profile data format suitable for both GCC and LLVM, so you could try to 
include that data into the packaging, and use it in the build process.
Don't assume too much speed improvements. I usually see around 3-6%.
