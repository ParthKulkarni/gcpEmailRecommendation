-Changing a program's name is much more easy than to change a first name
of a person

In fact its bad naming reduces its usefulness: Although there are some
useful programs contained, I know there are people which wouldn't
recommend it because of its naming (not only the package's name but
also because of the programs contained in the package). So if the
package stays in the archive, but would be renamed, its usefulness
would probably be increased.

It is not about an ancient work, those programs are fairly recent.

Probably not, but it would be bad, if we killed an animal for every
vegetarian entering the restaurant. As it is is bad to have every one
creating a Debian mirror distributing this insulting content, which
itself already creates an environment encouraging objectification of
people having boobs (note that one of the programs contained the term
"cook" and wasn't changed for an extra joke).

Did anybody ask you to do so? You didn't have to continue reading this
thread if it only wastes your time.
Kind regards,
