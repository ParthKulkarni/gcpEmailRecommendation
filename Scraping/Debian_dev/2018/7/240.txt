  Description     : module for recursive copying of files and directories
File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced is a Perl library which provides subroutines
exported on request which are intended to serve as drop-in replacements for
certain subroutines found in CPAN distribution File-Copy-Recursive.
It exports three functions on demand which are substantially equivalent to
their File::Copy::Recursive equivalents:
 *   "fcopy()"
 *   "dircopy()"
 *   "rcopy()"
These functions are quite appropriate in situations such as test suites where
the user has full knowledge of the files, directories and symlinks to be
recursively copied and does not need to manipulate the environment by setting
localized versions of File::Copy::Recursive's package global variables.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
