  Description     : Python based library for HPE iLO RESTful API on iLO 4 and iLO 5
 The Python iLO RESTful library is the platform on which the HPE RESTful
 tool was built on. It’s main purpose is to simplify the inband and
 outband communication to the HPE RESTful API. The HPE RESTful API for iLO
 is a RESTful application programming interface for the management of iLO
 and iLO Chassis Manager based HPE servers. REST (Representational State
 Transfer) is a web based software architectural style consisting a set
 of constraints that focus on a system’s resource. HPE REST library
 performs the basic HTTP operations GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE on
 resources using the HATEOS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application)
 REST architecture. The API allows the clients to manage and interact
 with iLO through a fixed URL and several URIs.
I've to deal with HPE hardware and servers mostly every day and the
python library provided by HPE seems to be useful for managing mass
configuration of that hardware. As HPE is one of the main contributors
of the Debian project and also using hardware from HPE I guess it's
worth to package this library.
The source is also providing a Sphinx based documentation and some
examples how to library can be used.
I'm not an experienced Python library packaging person so I'm happy to
find other people to co-maintain this library, talk to me on DC18 please
or by email!
So far I could read and study the ilorest-library isn't fully python3
ready, I'd start by packaging only the python2 variant for now.

Carsten
