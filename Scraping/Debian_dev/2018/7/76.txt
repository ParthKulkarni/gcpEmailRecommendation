Yes "Share groups with groups" is great to have.
But for now I can live with setting "share with group" for each project.
If a repo is in Debian (debian), then share with Debian Input Method
Team(input-method-team).
If a repo is in Debian Input Method Team(input-method-team), then share
with Debian (debian)
Then for non-DD, we only need to add them to Debian Input Method Team.
