While I agree that renaming the files in an arbitrary Debian package
should not be done without good reason, I do not agree that it should
not be done.  I believe the names in this package provide more than
sufficient justification to carry a local Debian fork (as was done for
Firefox/Iceweasel for many years for a different reason).
However, the maintainer of weboob has clearly expressed that he is not
willing and/or does not have the resources to maintain a local Debian
fork, so I did not suggest this.
