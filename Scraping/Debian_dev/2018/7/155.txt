  Description     : Core Eclipse components providing basic headless platform infrastructure
Eclipse Platform defines the set of frameworks and common services that
collectively make up infrastructure required to support the use of Eclipse
as a component model, as a Rich Client Platform (RCP) and as a comprehensive
tool integration platform. The core component provides basic platform
infrastructure that does not involve any UI.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to update
the Eclipse ecosystem in Debian and complete the transition to Java 11.
