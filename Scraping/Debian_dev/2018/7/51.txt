Whilst everything Colin wrote is true, there is also the detail that we
do a copyright and license check for every file shipped in the tarball.
If there are too many convenience copies this can easily outgrow the
patience (or more simply the available time) of the maintainer, at which
point repacking the upstream tarball is way simpler, easier and quicker.
It's a convenience call the maintainer decides, but one that IMHO always
ought to be done because with our current tooling removing files from
the upstream tarball is an automated process that takes seconds, where
the license check easily takes much more.
