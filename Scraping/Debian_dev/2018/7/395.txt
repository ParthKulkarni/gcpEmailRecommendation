  Description     : Public transport client, for the Västra Götaland county
 Västtrafik is the agency for public transport in Västra Götaland (Sweden).
 .
 This package provies a CLI to access their API and plan trips or see the
 incoming vehicles at a given stop.
The package is nice to use, since the web client is very heavy and slow.
I made it, I use it, I saw some activity on github but since it required
getting your own API key, it never became mainstream.
Now they changed how API keys are managed, so one user can get more keys, per
application, so I can publish the key and the software no longer requires
creating an account.
It is only useful in the specific area where västtrafik operates, but after
a discussion on the mentors IRC channels, it seems that it might be good to
include this in Debian.
