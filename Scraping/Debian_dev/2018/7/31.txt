To be honest: If the fact that get-orig-source is not part of Debian
policy any more would have the effect that people get motivation to
replace the old copyright format by the modern one I would stop asking
for re-introducing get-orig-source.

Codesearch will give you the exact number.  I've checked on my local
clones of Debian Med packages (released and in preparation):
   266 out of 901 are using Files-Excluded
Remark: I'm using Files-Excluded even when there is a need to write an
get-orig-source script and parse debian/coprright for it.  It might be
different over the whole package pool but for my use case its more than
25%.
Kind regards
    Andreas.
