We had discussed this some weeks ago.  My answer was:  Policy should
enforce that any random person gets a tool to reproduce the upstream
tarball.  Usually it is uscan but if there is no chance to accomplish
that task with uscan some alternative should be provided.  I have seen
many such "edge cases" and IMHO policy should cover all packages
including edge cases.  We are extremely picky to document the copyright
and license of every single file in a source tarball.  I fail to see a
good reason why we should not encourage maintainers to also provide code
to fetch those files.

I understand that the sense of the policy change is that it is package
specific and that I'm allowed to use it.  However, I'm now missing a
highly ranked documentation to point a newcomer to which answers the
question how to fetch the source code if uscan fails.

Not really, I do not want to use README.source or something like this.
I have a *personal* policy:  I will not sponsor any package if there is
no code I could run that recreates the source tarball.  May be I'm to
strict and the sponsee might find some other sponsor.  The Debian policy
change simply weakens my point where I think there are very good reasons
for.

I would love to create a new bug report but this would rather be:
   Provide get-orig-source target if (and only if) uscan would fail.
The previous discussion seem to show a tendency that this bug will
be at best tagged wontfix which for the moment prevents me from
calling reportbug right now.
Kind regards
         Andreas.
