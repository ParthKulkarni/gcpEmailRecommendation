  Description     : TAP test harness for Perl 6
Provides a TAP based test suite and report printing, in and for Perl 6.
TAP is the Test Anything Protocol used to Perl and other languages to
communicate results between unit tests and the test harness.
This package is critical for developing a Perl 6 ecosystem as most other
Perl 6 modules will have it as a build dependency to run tests.
There is a Perl 6 / rakudo packaging group and we plan to maintain all
Perl 6 modules together.
