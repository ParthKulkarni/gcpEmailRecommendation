  Description     : A raft transport that uses HTTP to initiate connections between nodes
 golang-github-canonicalltd-raft-http provides the rafthttp package, which can be used to establish a network
 connection between to raft nodes using HTTP. Once the HTTP connection is
 established, the Upgrade header will be used to switch it to raw TCP mode, and
 the regular TCP-based network transport of the raft package
 (https://github.com/hashicorp/raft) can take it from there.
This is a dependency of LXD 3 (ITP: #768973) and will be maintained under the
Go team umbrella.
