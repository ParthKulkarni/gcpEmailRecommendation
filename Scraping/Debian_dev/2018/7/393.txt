  Description     : Emacs interface to a Transmission session
This package provides an Emacs interface to a Transmission session. A
variety of commands are available for manipulating torrents and their
contents, many of which can be applied over multiple items by
selecting them with marks or within a region. One can add,
start/stop, verify, remove torrents, set speed limits, ratio limits,
bandwidth priorities, trackers, etc. Also, one can navigate to the
corresponding file list, torrent info, or peer info contexts. In the
file list, individual files can be toggled for download, and their
priorities set.
