  Description     : python library for reading and writing PDFs, powered by qpdf
This is a new dependency of the latest upstream release of OCRmyPDF.
I intend to maintain it under the Debian Python Modules Team umbrella.
After discussion with upstream, I plan to upload to experimental,
because the library's API is not yet stable.  Upstream expects it to
have stabilised in time to upload to unstable in time for the buster
freeze.
