For some it was an acceptable stopgap, for others a temporary solution, 
but as upstream is unwilling to rename this would mean an endless and 
painful chore. Also when do you stop renaming? Would having all

pretty sure there would be some to object having Python code with 
readable puerile things in it.
So that's true I did not explain this: I'm already struggling to have 
enough "spoons" to do useful things in Debian and other projects, so I'm 
not going to consider this non-solution.
I've drawn the line and if the software happens to go beyond it and 
upstream refuses to fix in a timely manner I will myself remove it from 
the archive. I may also refine my criteria and reevaluate later.
