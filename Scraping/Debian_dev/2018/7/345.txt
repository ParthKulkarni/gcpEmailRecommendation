With respect, I think your analysis is seriously flawed. As has been
pointed out in this thread (by Miriam, for instance[0]), there is harm from
the sexualised atmosphere that weboob contributes to[1]. That you, as a
man, don't perceive that harm is, I'm afraid, part of the problem. You
should listen to women's experiences (and the harm they experience), and
accept that they are authoritative in this regard. Therefore, you should
rename the offensive parts of this package.
There is a general point here, that people in the majority often fail to
appreciate the harm done to minorities, but I don't think now is the
place to belabour it.

I'm afraid I won't be at DebConf, so email will have to do :)

[0] As she points out, women shouldn't have to weigh in on every thread
of this sort.

has already been mentioned in this thread
