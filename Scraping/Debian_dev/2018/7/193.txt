  Description     : Basic building blocks for text and text editors within Eclipse
Eclipse Platform Text is part of the Platform UI project and provides
the basic building blocks for text and text editors within Eclipse and
contributes the Eclipse default text editor. It consists of five parts:
 * The text infrastructure provides facilities for text manipulation,
   position management, and change notification.
 * JFace Text provides UI components for editing and presenting text.
   It offers support for rule based styling, content completion,
   formatting, model reconciling, hover help, and vertical rulers.
 * The text editor framework provides the abstract implementation
   of an Eclipse text editor.
 * The File Buffers plug-in which introduces text file buffers for
   shared access to the content of a text file in form of an IDocument
   and and associated IAnnotationModel.
 * A concrete editor implementation: the Eclipse default text editor.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to update
the Eclipse ecosystem in Debian and complete the transition to Java 11.
