It would be intresting if we look at some real examples. 
I emphasized GPL becase I see the project[1] mentioned in the original post.
is released under GPL. However, it didn't clearly clarify the license
of the pretrained network that the upstream distributes.
However, according to [1]'s readme: "Recomputing the AlphaGo Zero weights
will take about 1700 years on commodity hardware". Well, I guess that
means pure free software stack can never reproduce this work.
Apart from that Alpha-Go project, actually I see more pretrained models
released under MIT/BSD/Apache2, or public domain. Here is another example
about ImageNet, which is a typical dataset in the computer vision field.
   https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/models/bvlc_alexnet/readme.md
   Framework: Caffe(BSD-2-clause), repro code: (BSD-2-clause),
   pretrained-network: (public domain), dataset: ImageNet (???) [2]
   -> Software stack is free, but not the ImageNet dataset.
   -> Debian cannot distribute related applications in the main section.

OK, then what if the model is released under a more premissive license
such as MIT/BSD, given that the model is trained from non-free academic
dataset by a non-free software stack (replacable by CPU implementation
but with ridiculous time cost)? I think in this case that kind of
network can enter contrib.

The Computer Vision research community is eager to release their code
and model under premissive licenses such as BSD/MIT. Many related
conferences publish the papers without access restriction. The biggest
problem lies in the big data.

hmm... It appears to be quite incompatible to DFSG, but that's another
complex story :-)

    I searched and found no explicit license declaration of ImageNet.
	But according to the agreement text, the dataset may be non-free.
