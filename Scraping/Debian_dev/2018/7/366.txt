Please read
https://blog.valerieaurora.org/2017/08/15/what-white-supremacists-dont-want-you-to-know-the-paradox-of-tolerance/
and apply it here. It has a slightly different topic ( (In)tolerance ),
but most of it fits pretty damn well the point of inclusive or not.
Working software is not neccessarily much more important than hurt
feelings. Not if hurt feelings make us a worse place to be. And, unless
its "hurt feelings" of intolerant nazis[1], it doesn't matter if it's only
a single group or not. They are important. And hey, its not a just a
random group of 5 - its about half of humanity (and way to less of em as
members of our community)...
Now, can we all please stop being ridiculous and stop this thread?
Anyone who disagrees with the maintainers decision can either ignore it
or appeal to a higher body (FTPMaster, GR). More discussion won't make
it any better. Especially not as nearly all people discussing the matter
are mysteriously missing the body pieces so prominently featured in that
little-kid-selected-names of binaries.
[1] The one set of people valid to be excluded everywhere, no further
question asked. Stupid shitheads.
