I had a further thought about the names. Asides from the issue at hand,
there is no consistency between the command names. Some are prefixed
"boo", some are suffixed "oob", neither of which is particularly great
at identifying the parent project, and many are neither.
So a completely orthogonal rationale for renaming the tools would be to
unify them under a common, identifying prefix or suffix, or some other
common pattern. This would also permit the future development of a
subcommand pattern like git uses, "woob weather", "woob parcel", etc.,
should that be desireable.
I think the next best step for this particular suggestion would be for
me to take it upstream, and, assuming it meets with some kind of
positive response, I would also be happy to work towards implementing
it. So I will raise this in upstream's Gitlab.
