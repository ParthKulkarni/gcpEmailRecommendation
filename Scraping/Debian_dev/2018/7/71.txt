    Description: distributed FUSE filesystem backed by a Consul Key-Value store
 ConsulFS implements a FUSE filesystem that is backed by a Consul Key-Value
 store. Each key in the key store is represented by a file. Read and write
 the file to get and put the key's value. "/" characters in a key name are
 used to break up the keys into different directories.
