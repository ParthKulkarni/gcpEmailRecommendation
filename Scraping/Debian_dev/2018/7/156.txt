Go engine with no human-provided knowledge, modeled after the AlphaGo Zero paper
A Go program with no human provided knowledge. Using MCTS (but without Monte
Carlo playouts) and a deep residual convolutional neural network stack.
This is a fairly faithful reimplementation of the system described in the
Alpha Go Zero paper "Mastering the Game of Go without Human Knowledge". For
all intents and purposes, it is an open source AlphaGo Zero.

No network weights are in this package. If you manage to obtain the AlphaGo
Zero weights, this program will be about as strong, provided you also obtain a
few Tensor Processing Units. Lacking those TPUs, the author recommends a top
of the line GPU - it's not exactly the same, but the result would still be an
engine that is far stronger than the top humans.
