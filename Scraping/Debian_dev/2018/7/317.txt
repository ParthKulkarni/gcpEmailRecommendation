Even if Debian takes the position that the package name (and executable 
names, personality, etc.) are acceptable, there's no corresponding way to

has a wealth of terms for women that convey "Whatever you do with your 
mind, I will always see you for your body as a tool of my pleasure," but 
no corresponding ones for men.
(You can say that this is is a fault of the English language or of 
anglophone cultures, sure, but Debian operates primarily in the English 
language, so even if there were some such term in another culture, it 
would not be equivalent in impact.)
The closest is the homophobia - which only insults a subset of men, and 
often insults them by insinuating they're women (implying they should be 
subject to the usual disregard for women). "Soyboy" specifically refers to 
a right-wing urban legend that soy contains an estrogen analogue that 
cause men who consume too much soy to start turning into women. (I'd call 
it transphobic, too.)
If there were a package in Debian that crudely objectified men, tying into 
a cultural history of objectification of men as wide as this one ties into 
a cultural history of objectification of women, and with an upstream whose 
personality involved the female equivalent of "laddishness" - I think this 
would be a rather different discussion. And at that point the rebuttals 
of "Are we offended by words? Where will it end??" would make more sense, 
but it seems to me the current question isn't actually about just words.
And, as far as I know, everyone who's replied on this thread (myself 
included) is a man - so I think we should be particularly careful with "it 
doesn't bother me."
