Excuse me but I have not stated that I don't understand.
Disagreement is not the same as not understanding.
I think our (only) disagreement is regarding severity of the issue.
I think I do understand the problem but I have other concerns regarding side 
effects and consequences as well as concerns for proper justifications.
I've expressed concerns about irrational decisions and dangers of emotional 
judgements based on personal projections.
