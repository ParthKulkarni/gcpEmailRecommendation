Hi,
due to a job change a while ago, I'm no more using dhcpy6d and I
currently also don't have a setup where I'm able to test it properly
before uploading.
The listed co-maintainer, Henri Wahl (X-Debbugs-Cc'ed), is actually
upstream and he has started the package initially while I revamped it to
be uptodate with Debian standards.
Upstream does publish .deb packages of dhcpy6d, but they're meant for
Debian Stable and their packaging doesn't change much unless the package
in Debian Unstable changes. Upstream says, he's not experienced enough
with Debian's standards and procedures to maintain the Debian's official
dhcpy6d package himself alone. (And he would need a sponsor anyways.)
So we're basically searching for someone who can take over the main part
of packaging work for dhcpy6d. Anything which is related to upstream
code should be already covered by Henri as the communication with him
works very good (usually GPG encrypted :-). It works so good that we
currently do the Debian packaging in upstream's git repo at
https://github.com/HenriWahl/dhcpy6d in the branch "debian".
Currently the dhcpy6d package in Debian is multiple releases behind
upstream: 0.4.3 vs 0.7.2. So getting a new upstream version into Debian
would be the first thing to do for the prospective new maintainer of
this package. It's already a "3.0 quilt" package, but still at debhelper
9 and standards version 3.9.8 (as in Stretch).
Information about the package:
Package: dhcpy6d
Version: 0.4.3-1

Architecture: all
Depends: adduser, ucf, python:any (<< 2.8), python:any (>= 2.7.5-5~)
Pre-Depends: dpkg (>= 1.16.5)

Description-en: MAC address aware DHCPv6 server written in Python
 Dhcpy6d delivers IPv6 addresses for DHCPv6 clients, which can be
 identified by DUID, hostname or MAC address as in the good old IPv4
 days. It allows easy dualstack transition, addresses may be
 generated randomly, by range, by arbitrary ID or MAC address. Clients
 can get more than one address, leases and client configuration can be
 stored in databases and DNS can be updated dynamically.
