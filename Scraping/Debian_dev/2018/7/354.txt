If you put technical needs below religious ones (and this particular
religion is especially vile), something is really wrong.  Debian is supposed
to be inclusive for all users.  Working software is much more important than
hurt feelings -- especially if you care about feelings of only a single
group.
The diversity statement we approved explicitely welcomes participation by
everyone, and (by my reading) implicitly bans censorship.  You're trying to
promote censorship, and that I protest against.
Meow!
