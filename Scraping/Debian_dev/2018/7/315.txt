Rationality has a place, but so do feelings.
The names in this package are offensive, plain and simple. Are other
names offensive? Maybe. Does that mean we should do nothing until we've
come up with some general "rule" as to what's allowed and what's not?
Hell no.
Note, I'm not saying we should kick weboob out. But these names are
offensive, and I think it's fair for us to tell upstream "we don't like
that, please do something about it".
Upstream might well (will probably) say "no". But that doesn't
invalidate the point.
