  Description     : Additional protections for Tor Onion Services
vanguards uses the Stem Tor control port library to connect to a Tor control
port. It has three defense subsystems: Vanguards, Rendguard, and Bandguards.
All three subsystems apply to both service-side and client-side onion service
activity, but NOT to any client traffic that exits the Tor network to the
normal Internet.

The package will be built to use PyPy in unstable and testing. Depending
on the availability of a backport for pypy-stem (see #904454) a backport
to stable may be built using CPython 3 instead of PyPy.
The package will include a disabled by default systemd service file.
This will be disabled by default as it's not great when two processes
try to control tor at the same time and so starting a process to control
tor should be an explicit action.
This will be maintained within the pkg-privacy team.
