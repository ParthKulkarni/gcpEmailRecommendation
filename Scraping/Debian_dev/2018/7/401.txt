  Description     : FeatherNotes is a lightweight Qt5 hierarchical notes-manager for Linux.
FeatherNotes (by Pedram Pourang, a.k.a. Tsu Jan tsujan2000@gmail.com) is a lightweight Qt5
hierarchical notes-manager for Linux. It is independent of any desktop environment and has:
* Support for rich text formatting, image embedding and inserting editable tables;
* Drag-and-drop capability for moving nodes and also for embedding images;
* A tray icon for quick access on any desktop;
* Correct position/size saving and restoring with most window managers;
* Compact but complete search and replacement widgets;
* The ability to include searchable tags (hidden info on each node);
* Support for local and remote hyperlinks (bookmarks);
* Text zooming;
* Printing and exporting to HTML and PDF;
* Password protection;
* Auto-saving; and
Other features that can be found in its settings, on its menus or when it is actually used.
Usefulness: We don't have a Qt based note taking application right now, so FeatherNotes will
a great enhenchment of the LXQt and Qt portfolio at all. The LXQt packaging team will maintain
it.
