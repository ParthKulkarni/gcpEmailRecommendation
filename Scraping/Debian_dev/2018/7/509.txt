  Description     : C-Implementation of CoAP, API version 2
Lightweight application-protocol for devices that are constrained their
resources such as computing power, RF range, memory, bandwidth, or
network packet sizes. This protocol, CoAP, is developed in the IETF
working group "CoRE", <http://6lowapp.net> and was standardized in RFC
7252. 
The existing libcoap package in the archive isn't able to use
any cryptography features. libcoap2 will provide an updated library
which also provides encryption based on the library libssl1.1. It's
planned to also support encryption based on GnuTLS at a later time. A
first RC is expected to be released soon.
The resulting upstream modifications to libcoap are not backwards
compatible. To keep the existing library coinstallable with the current
version I want to package the newest version within a separate source
package.
The packaging will be done within the IoT packaging group as a team
managed package.
Regards
Carsten
