Quack,
(This is a followup of the thread started on debian-private. This is not 
a private matter at all, and we should have discussed this openly from 
the start.)
It has been brought to my attention that this package, its name and the 
name of the binaries and further content was deemed offensive. This was 
already raised in the past (~2012 IIRC) but the package was reintroduced 
and has been in the archive since then.
Since this is a childish naming which was not intended at being 
insulting, I gave a hand to package this useful tool. I would have 
preferred it renamed though.
This thread is about giving your opinion and discussing with upstream 
about it, and us DD to decide the fate of this package. I hope this 
would help draft proper policy criteria about what we consider not 
acceptable.
May I dare to hope we would discuss this is a civilized manner?
