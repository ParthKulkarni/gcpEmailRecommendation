Thanks for clarifying.
I believe none of the general public licenses (neither liberal nor 
copyleft) require non-rediculous cost for the freedoms protected.
I therefore believe there is no license violation, as long as the code 
is _possible_ to compile without non-free code (e.g. blobs to activate 
GPUs) - even if ridiculously expensive in either time or hardware.
We have a practical problem in distributing such code, however, if every 
package release blocks our build daemons for 100+ years.
