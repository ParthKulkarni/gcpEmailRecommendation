Thanks.  This looks like a classic case of letting the perfect be the
enemy of the good (or perhaps, of not understanding the use case for
which the existing practice was good enough).  Some quotes from the
bug:

Certainly it's even more useful to have a debian/watch file, but this
doesn't make it clear to me what I'm supposed to do with those 3,000
source packages now.

This hasn't been an obstacle to my use.  I can even try multiple
directories.  What's helpful for me is that it works from *somewhere*.

Likewise, either works fine for my use.

As long as the command prints an error about the required tool, I can
install it.

What is a newcomer supposed to do now when they encounter a package
that does not provide an explanation of how to generate the upstream
tarball?
