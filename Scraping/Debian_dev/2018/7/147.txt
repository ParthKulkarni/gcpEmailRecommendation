The Equinox Bundles project is tasked with implementing all add-on services
detailed in the OSGi specifications including the output of the various OSGi
Expert groups. For example, the Core Platform, Enterprise and Mobile Expert
Groups. In addition, the bundles component team defines and produces bundles
and services that are of general utility to OSGi systems and programmers.
For example, the Bundles team is responsible for the Extenstion registry
used throughout Eclipse.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to update
the Eclipse ecosystem in Debian and complete the transition to Java 11.
