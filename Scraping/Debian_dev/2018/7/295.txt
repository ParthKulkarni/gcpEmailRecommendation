That works if Debian was a non-diverse groups where everyone had similar
views on what is offensive.  In that case the maintainer could just have
done whatever or would not have uploaded the package at all.
Sadly(?) Debian is too diverse and "we (as a project)" won't agree on
what is offensive or where what level of offensive content is okay.
In this case I feel like we might as well try to reach a consensus on
whether pride parades are a display of sexual depravity, sexual
liberation or self-objectification; or skipping that part any trying to
agree if and how pride parades should be fixed.
The current policy[1] leaves it up to the maintainers to make this
judgement and I don't think a discussion on -devel@ will reach a
consensus that would take away the responsibility here.
