I think we are mixing two discussions here. One is, if the humor shown
is offensive for Debian to redistribute it. The other is, if the package
treats fellow-humans that have boobs (females, older males, others)
particularly badly.
>From what I observed in this thread, few consider the package to be
unbearingly offensive in its own right. This is in particular so since
the names of binaries are only seen after the installation. "weboob" is
a "web"-tool and shall be read as "web-oobs" by the unprimed reader.
This leaves it to the concern focusing with the naming on a body feature
that is mostly associated with females. I hence suggest to add
semantically mostly equivalent names that refer to features mostly
associated with males. Here some suggestions for the ones considered
most disturbing:
wetboobs -> dripdick
handjoob -> handjob
boobtracker -> dicktracker
flatboob -> accomodick
boobooks -> readick
boobcoming -> dickoming
....
This way, basically short of a dh_links instruction, we would maintain
our gender balance and don't start censoring what typically ends with
puberty, anyway.
Cheers,
