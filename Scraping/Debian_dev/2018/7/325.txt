I admit I did not read the full thread.

Thanks for pointing me to this resource. I think I have read in it 
before. I read the page you have mentioned and some others.
Appreciating the beauty of women, and men! and any human being 
regardless of gender identity, or even a flower or animal is one thing. 
I have no issue with that.
What women wrote on the page you mentioned is something else. And what 
from what I read here upstream developers do with the weboob project is 
also something else. I see no appreciation for the beauty of women in 
the way how weboob developers name the binaries.

I did and still do it. For privacy reasons I omit details here.

So this is more about reactions from people who read this mailing list 
or may be pointed to this thread, but are not necessarily members of or 
contributors to the Debian project?
My question was more aimed what members of or contributors to the Debian 
project can do to improve the current situation, cause as you say Debian 
that means the people behind it cannot control what is happening outside 
of it.
Of course this does not make those threats any better or any less 
harmful. But to improve the current situation within the project, in 
case it needs improvement, which I bet it still does, may help to 
provide at least some sense of safety and security for women.

From my own experience I do not agree with that. Oppression of men by 
women may not be that visible, may be more subtle and (probably by far) 
not that wide-spread, but I have experienced it personally. For reasons 
to protect my own privacy and safety I do not share the details of that 
experience here on this list.
Also I recently just read an article from a woman about dating men and 
had the impression that there was a lot of hatred and objectification 
towards men in it. I understood where it came from as I read from past 
experiences of that woman with dating, but still, I did not feel 
respected as one most would call a man, after reading that article.
So from my experience it is not as simple as black and white. Also not 
from what I heard or read, even from women.
But it does not matter any way. Whatever anyone else does cannot justify 
or make appropriate or not appropriate what I do. So whether women 
oppress men or not cannot make what weboob upstream developers do any 
more appropriate or not appropriate.
It even does not matter who started the violence or who did more or who 
did less. What matters is to end it. Step by step.

I fully agree with that.

I feel no intention to produce such counterarguments.
