  Description     : dockapp that monitors your system
wmmisc is a simple dockapp that monitors the following: the amount of
users logged in, the total number of processes, the number of running
(or 'alive') processes, the total number of forks and the system load
average.
wmmisc was removed in Debian in 2010.  However, it was recently adopted
upstream and a new version released.
I plan to package wmmisc under the umbrella of the Debian Window Maker Team.
