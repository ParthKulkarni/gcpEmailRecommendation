  Description     : unidentifiable proxy that helps you bypass firewalls
Trojan features multiple protocols over TLS to avoid both active/passive
detections and ISP QoS limitations. It tries to hide a proxy service
behind a normal HTTPS service. It is an improvement over existing tools
and protocols, such as shadowsocks.
An online documentation can be found in
https://trojan-gfw.github.io/trojan/.
The package will be maintained by myself alone. A sponsor interested in
this field is needed to upload it.
