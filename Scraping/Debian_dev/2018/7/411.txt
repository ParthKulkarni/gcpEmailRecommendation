  Description     : GlassFish MBean Annotation Library (Primitive Function Library)
The GlassFish MBean Annotation Library (gmbal, pronounced as in "gumball")
is a runtime annotation processor that creates Open MBeans. This is useful
for creating a management API for existing code with minimal effort. It is
intended to be applied to existing modules (which may be OSGi bundles in
GlassFish v3, or any other packaging model including standard jar files),
but could be used anywhere that it is desired to combine the definition of
the management API with the module API and implementation.
Gmbal is not limited to use in GlassFish. Gmbal is completely independent
of GlassFish, and may be used in a context where GlassFish is not present.
This package contains the primitive function library used by Gmbal.
The package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to build
the JAX-WS reference implementation. JAX-WS was previously embedded
in the JDK but will be removed in Java 11.
