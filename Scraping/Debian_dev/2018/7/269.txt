Of course there isn't. But if the package is incredibly specialized, it
might make sense to do that anyhow. Debian is not bound to reuse the
upstream name, although in many cases it makes sense (first and foremost
when scripts are concerned, but there are plenty of other reasons).

I guess I was mostly concerned about the global namespace rather than a
library-specific one.

Fair. Although, to note, it used to be called tor-arm according to the
package's description. And it feels like the possible target audience of
sbws is even less than the one of nyx. That said: Maybe include the
target audience (i.e. who is going to have an interest in running this
package) somewhere in your description. If this is of interest to all
relay operators rather than just the authorities, that's probably relevant.

Well, tor-* was a proposal to disambiguate a short name. I don't
particularly care what the prefix would be.
