  Description     : Helper tools for building Eclipse related packages
This project contains helper tools to ease the packaging of Eclipse related
projects. These projects often consist in a collection of bundles built with
Tycho. Since Tycho isn't fully usable in Debian yet this package provides
an alternative way of building the bundles using Ant.
Eclipse Debian Helper provides an Ant macro designed to build a bundle and
a debhelper buildsystem class to reduce the boilerplate in debian/rules.
By convention we assume a one to one mapping between bundles and Debian
packages. The package name is automatically derived from the bundle name.
For example the org.eclipse.foo.bar bundle is packaged as
libeclipse-foo-bar-java. Equinox packages are handled slightly differently,
org.eclipse.equinox.foo is mapped to libequinox-foo-java.
The binary packages carry the version of the bundle packaged. For example
if the project eclipse-platform-foo 4.9.2 contains the version 1.2.3 of the
bundle org.eclipse.foo, the version of the libeclipse-foo-java package
will be 1.2.3+eclipse4.9.2-1.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team.
