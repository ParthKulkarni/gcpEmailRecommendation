Thank you very much, Miriam, for your *courage* to speak out your truth.

I understand. You and your friends have gone through similar situations 
many times.
I am sorry that this happened to you.
I wonÂ´t defend the men who you experienced these situations with. They 
were certainly not acting in my name. I have been accused of being 
overly sensitive myself, many times. I know how that feels. And I am 
happy that meanwhile I found a way to let it go.

I accept your point of view.
I welcome you to the Debian project.
I know I can only speak for myself, and I know that my acceptance may 
not necessarily help you to feel safer.
I agree with you about changing the messages and changing the binary 
names in the way you wrote. I am also okay with seeing the package be 
removed from the archive, in case the former would be too much work for 
the maintainer to maintain.

I accept that. I wonÂ´t urge you to write anything more in this thread.
I will continue my letting go journey to contribute my part to healing 
what is wounded between men and women, to contribute my part to end the 
violence between the genders.
Thank you for your openness. I felt like offering you a virtual hug. 
However I am unsure whether youÂ´d like to accept one from me, from 
someone you likely do not know although you might have seen me at 
DebConf15 in Heidelberg. So I let that go as well. As well as any 
wanting of approval from you for what I wrote here, or any wanting of 
controlling your experience, any wanting to make you feel better and 
more welcome than how you feel.
Ciao.
