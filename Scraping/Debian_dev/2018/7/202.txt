Severity: wishlist

Programming Language: C
Description: convert ASCII hexadecimal Unicode code points to UTF-8
The utf8gen package contains one program, utf8gen, which reads
hexadecimal numbers interpreted as Unicode code points and produces
formatted output.  The numbers are provided one per line.  Each
number is optionally followed by a space plus miscellaneous text.
The output is specified by providing printf(3)-style format strings
on the command line.  This provides the flexibility to print UTF-8
byte values in any desired base, echo the input value formatted as
a comment in any desired programming language, or even to provide
HTML-like table entries.  Optional miscellaneous text on each input
line can be copied to the output.
The suggested additional packages allow converting the man page
to PDF and converting the Texinfo user guide to PDF and/or HTML.
