Incompabilities come in different levels: shell script compatibility is
one, but there are also package names, API or ABI, file system hierarchy
etc.
We have no basic rule to keep any of them; it is all about weighting
pros and cons.

Sure. My point here is that we don't have a fixed rule "never break
third-party scripts". We (or the package maintainer) should carefully
see whether the advantage of using non-offending names outweights the
compatibility issues.
