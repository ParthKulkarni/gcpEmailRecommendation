That is not just about package names -- even the programs were called
like that (with the original names linked to it, however). When I
started Icedove, the program title (and everything else) still showed
the Debian name. This is also "end user compatibility".
I don't see why renaming would break our core principles. When it comes
to "Our priorities are our users [...]", we have to weight between
offending users and staying compatible, so the outcome is depending on
the weight for each topic (and any well-founded solution would not break
this principle).
