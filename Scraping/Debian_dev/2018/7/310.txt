This suggests that you did understand Matthew's reply, but the rest of
your message implies that you didn't. Honestly I'm not sure I've got the
skill to explain it to you, I'm not sure I could do a better job than
Matthew at summarizing the issue. I'm afraid I must bow out, focus on
fixing the problem, and leave it to others or to self-study for you to
understand it, if you wish to.
