I'm wondering, wouldn't renaming the package be a solution there too ? Based on the examples set by the packages fortunes-*off, wouldn't "web-oob-off", "web-oob-qt-off", "python-web-oob" and "python-web-oob-core" be a way to solve this problem ?
For the people sensitive to this kind of material, I guess we don't want them to read the whole package description before realizing that this is not something they would want to use. So I guess the package descriptions would have to be changed as well to explain immediately the "-off" part before explaining anything else.
It would allow keeping the same content, keeping it compatible with upstream.
I'm asking because I'm currently considering writing an application that would use Web-oob, and anything that would break the compatibility could obviously make my life harder.
