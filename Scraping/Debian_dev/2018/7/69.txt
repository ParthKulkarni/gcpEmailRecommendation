This support request should have been sent to the debian-lts or debian-
user list.

There is no such package.  Various security fixes resulted in kernel
ABI changes, so we had to change the binary package names. 
Specifically, linux-image-3.16.0-4-amd64 has been replaced by
linux-image-3.16.0-6-amd64.
If you use "apt full-upgrade" to install security updates that should
bring in new packages as necessary.
