Hi,
Point to to the right HOWTO.
I want that the https://salsa.debian.org/input-method-team VCS to be all
accessible by any DDs like https://salsa.debian.org/debian as
the maintainer.
How can I do it?
Having a project specific group for write access is good feature of
input-method-team.  Moving a repo to https://salsa.debian.org/debian
requires me to add project member for each package... too much effort.
If there is an easy way to add access for input-method-team to specific
packages in https://salsa.debian.org/debian then that is as good for me.
Any idea?
Osamu
