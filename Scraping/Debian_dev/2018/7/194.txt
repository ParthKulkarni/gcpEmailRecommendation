  Description     : User interface and help components of the Eclipse IDE
The Eclipse Platform UI project is responsible for the runtime, user
interface and help components of Eclipse. Platform UI provides the basic
building blocks to create the Eclipse IDE and other Eclipse based
applications called Rich Client Platform (RCP). The Eclipse IDE is just
one instance of an RCP application, but it demonstrates the power and
extensibility achievable by RCP applications.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to update
the Eclipse ecosystem in Debian and complete the transition to Java 11.
