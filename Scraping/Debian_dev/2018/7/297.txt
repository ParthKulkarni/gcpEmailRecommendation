I don't think the maintainer's decision about this is "final", no more
than it is about any other interpretation of policy or project
standards or rc-bugginess or licences or anything else.
The policy says that the maintainer should make a decision about this;
but it often says the maintainer should decide this or that and that
does not preclude review by (eg) the release team, ftpmaster, the TC,
or, ultimately, GR.
But the starting point is certainly the maintainer.  And it is good
for maintainer to solicit input, as they have done in this case.
Ian.
