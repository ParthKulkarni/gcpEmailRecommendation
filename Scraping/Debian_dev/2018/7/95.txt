Hi,
FYI:
 Now sgml-data is listed in https://salsa.debian.org/xml-sgml-team

I see.  I also saw:
  https://lists.debian.org/debian-sgml/2018/02/msg00000.html
by  Joseph Herlant who created https://salsa.debian.org/xml-sgml-team
Since we have developer ML as debian-sgml@lists.debian.org, why not use
it as group mail address.  Then we already have well supported stable
archived ML system.  ...
Is team+foo@tracker.d.o address usable now?  Any howto to set it up?

Yes.  Also prople are using their name as Maintainer instead of group
mail address.

Are you suggesting some manual repo move?  Is that important?
I added xml-sgml-team group member a group write access to the sgml-data
archive as Developer.  This action has nice side effect.  Now, sgml-data
is listed under https://salsa.debian.org/xml-sgml-team as a member
project.
Currently, xml-sgml-team projects doesn't add debian group at the top
level.  That should be possible soon with updated github.  If you intend
to give access to all DD, setting write access by the debian group (DD)
may be an option.
