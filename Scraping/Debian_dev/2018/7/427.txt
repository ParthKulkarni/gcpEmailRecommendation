  Description     : module to fork+exec, or spawn, a subprocess as
quickly as possible
The purpose of this small (in scope and footprint) module is simple: spawn a
subprocess asynchronously as efficiently and/or fast as possible. Basically
the same as calling fork+exec (on POSIX), but hopefully faster than
those two
syscalls.
Apart from fork overhead, this module also allows you to fork+exec programs
when otherwise you couldn't - for example, when you use POSIX threads in
your
perl process then it generally isn't safe to call fork from perl, but it is
safe to use this module to execute external processes.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
