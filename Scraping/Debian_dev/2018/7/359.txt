Could I welcome feeling attacked in person? Yes.
Could I let go feeling attacked in person? Yes.
A weapon is a tool made specifically for the purpose of harming or 
killing human beings (or at least their bodies). Most books are not. Yet 
even with weapons human beings are responsible. That does not make it 
any better to give weapons freely to anyone who would like to have one. 
There are areas where it makes sense to restrict what human beings can 
do by not providing them the tools that are necessary or make it at 
least much more easy to do it.
I do not endorse of the bible in its current canonical variants 
mainstream churches use. Neither I do endorse of weapons. Quite the 
contrary.
In any case my initial remark regarding the bible did not contribute to 
the discussion here, I think.

The point is that it currently is in Debian, binary names unchanged:
% rmadison weboob | grep unstable
weboob     | 1.3-1         | unstable           | source, all
Of course it can be changed.
Thanks.
