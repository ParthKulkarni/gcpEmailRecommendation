You are overreacting. Name of the package may be tasteless but still not bad 
enough to justify exclusion. I fear of misuse of diversity statement to 
justify morally distorted decisions against something mild like this 
particular case.
Here is an example: I'm aware of legal human name that is offensive and 
inappropriate in another language. Nobody in the right mind would use 
diversity statement against people with such names. Even bringing such matter 
to attention of a person is awkward to say the least and may be even 
insulting on its own.
Asking person to change his name because it is unpleasant to us would be 
beyond rude.
Let's just leave the matter alone please. If contributors find it 
sufficiently repulsive to maintain the package then you will be able to 
remove (unmaintained) package soon enough. Otherwise we can say that 
usefulness of the package outweighs its bad naming.
Another argument is that many things in older literature, fairy tales and 
religious texts may be considered offensive these days. Yet banning those 
things would be wrong and would cause far greater damage to freedoms.
If we were operating a restaurant, would you suggest to remove all non-
vegetarian meals from the menu because some of our customers are vegetarians?
Surely they may consider meat to be offensive but normally it is enough to be 
respectful to people's rights not to use whatever they consider inappropriate 
to them.
I'd much rather not waste any time to facilitate or justify useless renaming 
like "fsckeditor" to "ckeditor", etc.
