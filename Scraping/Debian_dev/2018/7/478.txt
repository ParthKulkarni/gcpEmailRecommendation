If it's just for bootstrapping, I'd consider temporarily embedding the
older protobuf version in the kotlin source package instead, with a note
that this will be removed once you're on a current version.  That should
be less work for ftpmasters, quite possibly even less work for you, and
it doesn't make it look like the old version of protobuf is being
packaged for general use.
