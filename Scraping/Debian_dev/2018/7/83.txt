Only if it exists at the remote repo, of course.

There is no pristine-tar branch in that repo. It's not even a gbp repo at
all, it doesn't contain Debian packaging in either master or release
branches.
If you are instead trying to start packaging the project located in that
repo you need to follow the docs at
file:///usr/share/doc/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.import.upstream-git.html
instead.
Also, the packaging quesations should be asked at debian-mentors@, not
debian-devel@.
