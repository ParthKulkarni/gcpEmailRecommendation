It has WARNING already, please install dose-extra to see the results.
The reason is, e.g.
First check `apt rdepends of sgml-data`, you will find like
docbook-xml depends on it.
Then check `build-rdeps docbook-xml`, you will find another 287
packages(if you don't install dose-extra).
...
dose-extra can do these works for you, and finally you'll get 1336
reverse build-depend(s) for sgml-data.
