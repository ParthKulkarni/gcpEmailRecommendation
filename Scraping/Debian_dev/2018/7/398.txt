    Description: compute various size metrics for a Git repository
 git-sizer computes various size metrics for a Git repository, flagging
 those that might cause problems or inconvenience. For example:
 .
  • Is the repository too big overall?
  • Does the repository have too many references (branches and/or tags)?
  • Does the repository include too many objects?
  • Does the repository include gigantic blobs (files)?
  • Does the repository include many slightly different large text files?
  • Does the repository include gigantic trees (directories)?
  • Does the repository have many identical files?
  • Does the repository include absurdly long path names?
  • Are there other bizarre and questionable things in the repository?
    • Annotated tags pointing at one another in long chains?
    • Octopus merges with dozens of parents?
    • Commits with gigantic log messages?
 .
 git-sizer can help to reveal the problems described above.
