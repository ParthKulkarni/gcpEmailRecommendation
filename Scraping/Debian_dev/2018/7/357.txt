[â€¦ left out speculative case that in my opinion does not add to the 
discussion â€¦]
"interact constructively with our community" is about human beings.
Human beings have values, thoughts, feelings. They are not objects, they 
are not things. They are commonly called subjects. But the names of the 
binaries in the weboob package for my sense seem to suggest that women 
would be things with boobs. A pretty good example for objectification if 
you ask me.

I think no one said that there is inherently anything wrong with that.
But it appears to be a common argument:

That text did not *directly* cause anything. It were still human beings 
killing one another. The book is not responsible for anything. Human 
beings are.
So far I never read a text that magically caused me to do a certain 
thing without me having a chance to decide differently. If all the books 
here in my apartment would suddenly cause me to do all kind of things. 
Interesting idea, but so far this did not happen.

And judge it by that. Now what is your judgment? Is it a fact? If not, 
what is it then?
What is the common notion in our societies to mostly depict or describe 
mostly women as "sexual" while both men and women are sexual? That it is 
mostly unconscious does not make it any more factual.  Binary names in 
the weboob package are boob related, nothing about dicks for example. Is 
it a religion too? Hey, as a man, I am sexual too! (Of course in case 
you see all as expressions of one consciousness, being a man, being a 
woman is just identity, not the truth.)
I do not agree with the notion of men and women being the same which 
from what I see appears to be floating around in our modern societies, 
probably cause someone said it in the name of feminism. They are not.
But they are equal. Which means are to be treated equally fair and with 
respect. I do not see that with the weboob package being included in 
Debian with binary names unchanged.
I do not even agree with the word feminism. Nor with any other ism. I 
agree that from ism to religion is a short path way. I do not agree with 
everything that people said or did in the name of feminism or any other 
ism.
But I inherently agree with treating women as equal to men. Including 
weboob package unchanged in Debian is not treating them as equal to men.
How would a world free from power struggle between men and women look 
like? (Or even free from power struggle between any of the expressions 
of that one consciousness?)
Thanks.
