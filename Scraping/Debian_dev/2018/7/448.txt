  Description     : Free software script for PayPal payments
PayPal is used for donations to a number of free software 
organisations, including the Debian project itself [1]. Unfortunately,
at present, PayPal requires the use of proprietary software (typically
JavaScript) to so much as make a donation. Further, it would appear this
software tracks the user well beyond what is strictly necessary for the
transaction. 
Pagamigo is a free software script to enable the user to complete PayPal
transactions, avoiding the proprietary JavaScript. It currently
implements:
	- The redirect flow, as used by many online merchants
	- Peer-to-peer money transfers ("Send money")
It is implemented in architecture-independent Python3. All of its
dependencies are already packaged in Debian, which should simplify
packaging greatly.

----
I am the upstream author of Pagamigo; I have been developing the
software as part of my internship with the Free Software
Foundation. I am interested in maintaining it in Debian.
I do not have Debian push access (is that the right terminology?) and
will need a sponsor.
I have begun packaging the software with dh-python3; the
work-in-progress `.deb` has been confirmed to be functional on
debootstrapped chroots of Debian unstable (aarch64) and Trisquel flidas
(amd64, an Ubuntu derivative). More rigorous testing to follow.
Thanks,
