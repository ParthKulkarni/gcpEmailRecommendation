Yuck... :( Incredibly tasteless and probably intentionally controversial...
I see your point and I agree with you yet renaming might still be 
inappropriate and/or ineffective. I'd like to see stronger justification for 
replacing uncomfortable reference to part of human body because why should it 
be uncomfortable? If double "O" is a problem then how are we not offended by 
Google? If we swap body part reference to another body part like "leg" or 
"arm", it becomes just ridiculous. 
I have no intention to defend this particular package but more interested in 
principle of justifying such actions.

That was about misuse of diversity statement. My point is about how 
inappropriate renaming might be, if pushed too far.
