  Description     : Sharness is a portable shell library to write, run, and analyze automated tests for Unix programs. Since all tests output TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, they can be run with any TAP harness (e.g. "prove").
Each test is written as a shell script, for example:
  test_expect_success "Success is reported like this" "
    echo hello world | grep hello
  "
  test_expect_failure "We expect this to fail" "
    test 1 = 2
  "
Sharness is used by a few Debian packages as part of their DEP8
tests (via autopkgtest):
  * gearmand
  * git-reintegrate
  * git-remote-bzr
  * git-remote-hg
  * hiera-eyaml
  * jemalloc
  * mod-gearman
  * munin
  * pass-otp
  * puppet-lint
  * puppet-module-puppetlabs-concat
  * puppet-module-puppetlabs-ntp
  * puppet-module-puppetlabs-stdlib
(the list was assembled via https://codesearch.debian.net)
Currently these packages embed a copy of the sharness.sh file below
debian/tests.
I will file bug reports against these packages (including patches) after
the sharness package is available, in order to help them getting rid of
their embedded code copies.
I am part of the munin packaging team, thus the munin package would
benefit immediately from this package.
I plan to maintain the sharness package for the foreseeable future.
I will need a sponsor for uploading this package.
Cheers,
Lars
