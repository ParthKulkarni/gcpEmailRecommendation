  Description     : remote-control dockapp for MPRIS-compatible media players
 wmusic is a dockapp that remote-controls MPRIS-compatible media players. Here
 is a list of the features:
 * VCR style controls including fast rewind and fast forward
 * Time and Playlist position display
 * Super stylee rotating arrow
wmusic was removed from Debian in 2008, when it was a remote control for xmms.
It was recently adopted upstream by the Window Maker Team, and a new release
was made available.  It now supports any media player with MPRIS (Media Player
Remote Interfacing Specification) [1] compatibilty by using the playerctl [2]
library, which is already available in Debian.
wmusic will be maintained by the Debian Window Maker Team.
