Hi,
Newest lintian will detect a few new problems in our package.
It will first detect minified javascript/css embedded in html file (source only). It it possible to avoid this warning by creating a symlink
 to source or adding source under debian/missing-source/$nameoffile.fragment (better naming welcome).
It will also detect html file that include script with a copyright statement. These scripts were likely copy-pasted and likely needs to be rebuilt from the original source.  
Moreover they may be also outdated and may need need to be updated from a security point of view. [1] They are a few false positive that will fixed ASAP.
Last but not least, lintian will detect browserify/webpack source both in html  included script and js file [2]. These file should be rebuilt from source
(I am now packaging browserify to main. Technically they are also some problem with browserified file that need to be rebuilt each time a depends change).
