While we don't operate under the same set of constraints and
assumptions, on the OpenStack Infrastructure team (basically the
OpenStack community's analogue of Debian's DSA) we found that having
a consistent and standardized framework for deploying the services
we operate on behalf of our community significantly increased the
ability of interested contributors to participate in the process of
designing and maintaining those services.
Granted, we don't give out SSH access to the servers and we drive
these sorts of tasks through code-reviewed changes to automation and
configuration management; but the idea that you as a random
individual with no root access to the production servers can with
just a few minutes locally deploy a dev version of one of our
services, modify it and then propose a patch (which subsequently
gets regression tested, reviewed by the root sysadmin team, and then
automatically deployed to production) is very empowering for our
community at large.
