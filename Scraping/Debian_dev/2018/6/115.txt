Yay, build systems that will be a nightmare to maintain later...
Though I admit golang is a crappy language to support given one has to
rebuild everything all the time there is a security update.  Just
imagine libc (or worse: linux) was written in Go and there was a
security update: just rebuild the distribution ;-) (And for third-party
providers wait for the vendored libc (or linux) to get updated, if that
will happen at all.)  So I'm not surprised many Golang things don't make
it to testing.
