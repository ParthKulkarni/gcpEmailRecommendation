  Description     : simple-to-use LibSass Go API
 This is currently a, hopefully, simple to use LibSass Go API.
 It uses the C bindings in https://github.com/wellington/go-libsass/libs
 to do the heavy lifting.
 .
 The primary motivation for this project is to add SCSS support to Hugo
 (https://gohugo.io/). It is has some generic tocss package names hoping
 that there will be a solid native Go implementation that can replace
 LibSass in the near future.
Reason for packaging: Need for the upcoming Hugo v0.43
