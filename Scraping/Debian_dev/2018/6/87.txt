I have some positive experience of looking after production Wordpress 
instance installed from Debian packages in a corporate environment. I'm quite 
happy with rate of Wordpress updates in Debian but more importantly packaged 
Wordpress have some interesting advantages:
1) Wordpress core is under package management control, not writable by web 
server. That eliminates one major security flaw so Wordpress can not update 
itself. Installing from packages helps to have better control over installed 
software.
2) Wordpress staff is usually somewhat under-qualified offshore people who 
can not touch Wordpress core as they have no rights to do so (no access).
3) Packaged wordpress helped to circumvent silly corporate security policy 
blocking outgoing HTTP requests as we were upgrading packages through package 
proxy (apt-cacher-ng).

The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate,
contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive, and
unrealistic. Belief in myths allows the comfort of opinion without the
discomfort of thought.
