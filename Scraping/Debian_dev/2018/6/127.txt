Package: iso-codes
Severity: wishlist
Version: 3.75-1
X-Debbugs-CC: debian-devel@lists.debian.org
I've been thinking about technical solutions to help the country list
bug[1] and the following possibility came to mind:
- define a virtual package with a name like "country-codes"
- src:iso-codes could be split into multiple binary packages, one would
be called iso-country-codes
- package the GENC[2] list as genc-country-codes
- both the iso-country-codes package and the genc-country-codes package
could provide the virtual country-codes so only one can be installed
Would other packages that depend on iso-codes be comfortable using GENC
if it was installed this way?
As an alternative, maybe both lists (ISO-3166 and GENC) could be
installed concurrently and the alternatives[3] mechanism could be used
to switch between them?
For the Debian Installer[4], maybe the installer can ask the user to
choose "Do you want to use ISO-3166 or GENC or load a custom country
list from a USB stick?".
