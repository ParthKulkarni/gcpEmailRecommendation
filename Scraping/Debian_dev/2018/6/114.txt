Unfortunately... However it is a static Golang binary with minimum external 
run-time dependencies which makes it possible to reasonably safely install 
rkt on Stretch straight from "unstable"...

rkt build-depends on some docker components, only on build time but not on 
run time so rkt could use docker container images directly and to pull them 
from docker registry.
Unlike Docker that lately became worse by splitting into three daemons and 
bloating its code base, rkt is not even a daemon. :)

You have to start with the truth. The truth is the only way that we can
get anywhere. Because any decision-making that is based upon lies or
ignorance can't lead to a good conclusion.
