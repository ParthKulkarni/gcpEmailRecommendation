Please give it some time.  The last test run was done only half an hour
ago, and it correctly passed now.
Also, Brtiney already noticed it, and if you look at
https://release.debian.org/britney/update_excuses.html#ruby-state-machines
you'll read "Required age reduced by 3 days because of autopkgtest", so
everything is great.
Tracker has a 4 hours delay on updating info whereas Britney now updates
hourly.
