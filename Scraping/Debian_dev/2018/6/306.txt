    Description: Open Container Images manipulation tool
 umoci creates and modifies Open Container images.
 See the official website (https://umo.ci/) for more accessible
 documentation about how to use umoci.
 .
 umoci intends to be a complete manipulation tool for OCI images
 (https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec).  In particular, it should
 be seen as a more end-user-focused version of the oci-image-tools provided
 by the OCI (https://github.com/opencontainers/image-tools). The hope is
 that all of this tooling will eventually be merged with the upstream
 repository, so that it is always kept up-to-date by the Open Container
 Initiative community.
 .
 umoci provides tooling that can abstract all of the internals of the OCI
 specification into a single CLI interface.
