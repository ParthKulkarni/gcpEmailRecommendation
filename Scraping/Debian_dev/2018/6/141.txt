  Description     : Firefox Sync storage and token server
This is an all-in-one package for running a self-hosted Firefox Sync
server. It bundles the "tokenserver" project for authentication and the
"syncstorage" project for storage, to produce a single stand-alone
webapp.
This server defers authentication to the Mozilla-hosted accounts server
at https://accounts.firefox.com, but stores the user sync data such as
bookmarks, preferences and add-ons.
---
It is useful for using the multiple-device features of Firefox Sync
without storing your sensitive data in the cloud. It would also be a
prerequisite for someone packaging the Firefox Accounts server.
I would love to maintain it as part of pkg-mozilla-maintainers, but
since the alioth list is defunct I've not yet got in touch.
