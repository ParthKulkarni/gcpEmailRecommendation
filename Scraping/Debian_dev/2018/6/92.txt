I think dak is quite different in two ways:
 * dak is very internal to Debian project. We don't have to package it just 
for internal consumption.
 * gitlab was already packaged. If we package it for everybody then we should 
be able to use it as well.

Interesting. I tend to deploy packages and use whatever problems I experience 
as incentive to update packaging. "Fix it for yourself and for everyone else" 
kind of thing is a powerful concept although not always the fastest...
