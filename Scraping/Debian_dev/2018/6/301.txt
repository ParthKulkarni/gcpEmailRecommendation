Hello,
A new open project has been created to collect the list of computer hardware devices with poor Linux compatibility based on the Linux-Hardware.org data within 4 years: https://github.com/linuxhw/HWInfo
There are about 29 thousands of depersonalized hwinfo reports (https://github.com/openSUSE/hwinfo) in the repository from Linux-powered computers in various configurations. The device is included into the list of poorly supported devices if there is at least one user probe in which the driver for this device was not found. The column 'Missed' indicates the percentage of such probes. If the number is small, it means that the driver was already added in newer versions of the kernel. In this case we show minimal version of the Linux kernel in which the driver was present.
Devices are divided into categories. For each category we calculate the ratio of poorly supported devices to the total number of devices tested in this category.
Everyone can contribute to this repository by uploading probes of their computers by the hw-probe tool: https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe
Thanks to all for attention and new computer probes!
