Please don't fall for Kubernetes fashion. From experience I can say that 
bloated Kubernetes code base is poorly maintained. Abuse of private 
libraries, bad versioning practices, neglect to trivial/straightforward 
issues, lack of productive responses to bug reports and other problems led me 
to believe that upstream barely manages to maintain the beast.
Kubernetes is such a terrible mess that I feel very uncomfortable about idea 
of using it in production environment. Keep in mind that all that stuff runs 
as root and we are likely to see mode CVEs...
I would definitely give "nomad" [1] a try first. It appears to aim at the 
same problem yet appears to be much nicer.

I'll see if I can update Nomad packages soon...
