Ah, of course.

I guess what I'm saying is that by delaying testing migrations, and by
planning to block them, we are giving the tests quite a high status.
Nearly as high a status as RC bugs.  I don't think that's
inappropriate.  (And note that the block can be as low as 2 days if
for some reason britney thinks the upload has urgency=high.)
Maybe the right approach is to have a convention that if the
maintainer of the depending package wishes to preserve the status quo
for longer than the current testing migration regression delay[1],
they should file two RC bugs: one against their own (depending)
package, and one against the dependency.  And that the maintainer of
the depending package should usually be OK with that - even if the
only problem is a test failure.
Filing an RC bug against the version in testing, and triggering the
autoremoval clock, is a sufficiently disruptive thing to do one of
one's own packages that this wouldn't be done lightly.  So there would
be some kind of equity.
Maybe I am belabouring all of this rather too much.  But this
autopkgtest testing migration stuff is new and will generate new
behaviours, and we need to establish new social norms.  It's probably
better if we write too many mails about it than too few.
Ian.
