  Description     : ISO 3098-compliant TrueType font for CAD projects
In some European countries, CAD projects must have a font which conforms
to the ISO 3098 specification. Such a font has been available in
commercial CADs but was not available for free CADs (including FreeCAD)
until this project.
The font is created with free tools like FontForge, Inkscape, and GIMP,
and is available under 3 licenses: GPL3, GPL2, and LGPL3, all with the
GPL font exception.
This font is used in FreeCAD 0.17's TechDraw technical drawing
workbench.
I plan on packaging it under the Debian Fonts Task Force.
