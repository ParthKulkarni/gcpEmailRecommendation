Turns out the current version sucks too much to deserve packaging.
The version I used for years was a single self-contained script that worked
reliably.  Current one:
* uses a long string of libraries with API stability worthy of NPM
  (https://github.com/click-contrib/click-log/issues/10 being one of two
  needed to even let it load)
* requires an long list of mandatory options instead of taking sane
  defaults.  For example, what used to be
    maildir-deduplicate Maildir/.Trash
  now is:
    mdedup deduplicate -n -s delete-non-matching-path -t date-header Maildir/.Trash/
  You need to say "deduplicate" just because there's an obscure debug option
  that hashes a single file (-H in the old interface), and the author
  decided to put regular functionality behind a subcommand!
* prints a lot of crap that used to be tersely given within two lines
* crashes in many mysterious ways -- I dealt with some but ran out of damn
  to give
So the only good option would be to stick with the old version, but that one
is Python2 only and unmaintained.
Not impressed.
Meow!
