Hi Jonas,
Just to start with, my message may sound harsh, it is meant to explain
though.

Great.

Yes, but this has nothing to do with the package not migrating. That
would only account for 10 days, just like the excuses say. In this case,
it wasn't migrated before we turned the code on to test autopkgtest.

That will not help ruby-sass migrate, as the problem lies elsewhere:
https://release.debian.org/britney/update_output.txt
trying: ruby-sass
skipped: ruby-sass (5, 5, 102)
    got: 46+0: a-3:i-42:a-0:a-0:a-0:m-0:m-0:m-0:p-0:s-1
    * i386: ruby-compass, ruby-compass-core, ruby-compass-import-once
I think you want to ask for removal of ruby-compass* from testing.
Britney refuses to update ruby-sass in testing because the amount of
installable packages will go down if it does.

You can search for Testsuite-Triggers in the Sources file if you really
want to. But for new regressions that occur, rest assure that they will
be detected and will be acted on.

You had to search elsewhere, you found a red harring.
