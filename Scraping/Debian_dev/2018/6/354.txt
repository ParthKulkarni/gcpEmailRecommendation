I was confused by Paul's earlier mail.  I think that it is probably
best if bugs are filed in the first instance against the package whose
autopkgtests fail (ie not the triggering package).
The maintainer of that package has an obvious interest in keeping
their dependency stack healthy, and is so much less likely to find
this a nuisance.
Sebastiaan's response shows that doing it the other way around can
involve people in having to deal with lossage in their dependencies,
which they may not know anything about or be able to do anything
about.
Ian.
