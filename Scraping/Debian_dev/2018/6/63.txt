  Description     : creates ZIM files from a locally-stored directory
zimwriterfs is a console tool to create ZIM files from a locally-stored
directory containing "self-sufficient" HTML content (with pictures,
javascript, and stylesheets). The result will contain all the files of the
local directory compressed and merged in the ZIM file. Nothing more, nothing
less. The generated file can be opened with a ZIM reader; Kiwix is one
example, but there are others.
The main purpose for this will be able to generate ZIM files using
tools that are packaged in Debian.
