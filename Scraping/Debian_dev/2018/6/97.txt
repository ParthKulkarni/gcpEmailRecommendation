My experience has been that if I'm working on a complex service then I
want as little friction as possible for the fast-moving stuff that I'm
working on directly and so often end up deploying that straight from git
or whatever, but that I prefer to use packages for everything else below
that layer.
I can perfectly well imagine taking different approaches to services
depending on whether I expected to be doing very hands-on maintenance
and/or development (in which case deploying from git is probably easier)
or whether I want to mostly leave them alone and deploy something that's
maybe not absolutely up to date but where somebody else is dealing with
most of the maintenance work (in which case packages would be
preferable).
