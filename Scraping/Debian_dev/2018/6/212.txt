Sharing here in case it is an example of a structural issue needing 
tweaking somewhere...
ruby-sass works fine.
ruby-compass previously worked fine, but is now dead upstream and 
conflicts with recent ruby-sass. https://bugs.debian.org/876608
ruby-bootstrap-sass works fine - but autopkgtest-depends on ruby-compass 
which stopped working when ruby-sass declared breakage with ruby-compass 
- and I noticed only now that effectively recent ruby-sass didn't enter 
testing.
I now did an NMU simply disabling ruby-bootstrap-sass autopkgtest parts 
related to ruby-compass.
How could I have known ahead about that autopkgtest-depends? 
"build-rdeps ruby-compass" doesn't reveal ruby-bootstrap-sass as a cause 
for trouble.
Can we improve some infrastructure to better catch situations like this 
in the future?
 - Jonas
