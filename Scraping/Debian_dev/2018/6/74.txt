Running packaged versions also means that only the system admins can
actually update the code.  However they don't want to run the services.
Until we have user-installable packages, this won't change.

GitLab and all the associated stuff is pulled from git repositories and
built on the system.  However, we actually pull in some external
binaries, for node, yarn and go.
You can find out how everything is done in our repository with Ansible
stuff at https://salsa.debian.org/salsa/salsa-ansible.  If you know a
better way to do something, just send patches the usual way.

Bastian
