Inquiring first seems like a very sensible thing to do. Maybe they could
even suggest a way to implement the functionality by some kind of hook
or something without directly modifying upstream code (or maybe they
will be glad to implement the ability to do so).
I ran in to issues with wanting to change the favicon too for salsa,
because I have way too many different gitlab tabs and they all look the
same and there's no sensible way to change it for salsa right now (I
tried out a bunch of regexes to do it in the reverse proxy but after an
hour or so I decided to rather get some pizza).
