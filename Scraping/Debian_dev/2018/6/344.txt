  Description     : Object-oriented chemical kinetics, thermodynamics & transport processes suite
Cantera is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for
problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport
processes. The software automates the chemical kinetic, thermodynamic,
and transport calculations so that the users can efficiently incorporate
detailed chemical thermo-kinetics and transport models into their
calculations.
The code utilizes object-oriented concepts for robust yet flexible phase
models, and algorithms are generalized so that users can explore
different phase models with minimal changes to their overall code.
Currently, Cantera can be used from Python 2/3 and Matlab, or in
applications written in C/C++ and Fortran 90. Cantera also provides a
limited number of solvers for time-dependent reactor networks and steady
one-dimensional reacting flows.
Cantera is currently used for applications including combustion,
detonations, electrochemical energy conversion and storage, fuel cells,
batteries, aqueous electrolyte solutions, plasmas, and thin film
deposition.
I plan on packaging this within the Debian Science Team.
