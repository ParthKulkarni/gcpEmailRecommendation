  Description     : simple editor for beginner Python programmers
Mu is a simple code editor for beginner programmers based on extensive feedback
from teachers and learners. Having said that, Mu is for anyone who wants to use
a simple "no frills" editor.
Mu is a modal editor with modes for Adafruit's CircuitPython, the micro:bit's
version of MicroPython, PyGame Zero and standard Python 3 (including a graphical
debugger). Some of the modes make available a REPL (either running on the
connected CircuitPython or MicroPython device or as a Jupyter based iPython
session in Python3 mode).
