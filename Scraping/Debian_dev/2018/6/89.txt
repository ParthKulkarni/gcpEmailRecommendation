We are not disagreeing here; I was talking about packages vs git
checkouts of services, not about distributions.

Yes, this happens.  I've also come across installations of Debian
several releases out of date where everything came from packages, so
using packages is not a panacea.  Systems have to be maintained no
matter where the bits on the system come from.

At the risk of extrapolating from a single data point, I think Alioth
showed that using VMs does not fix this automatically.  (I'm not picking
on the Alioth maintainers, I used to be one of them. The job of
maintaining your own separate infrastructure has a non-trivial cost.)
