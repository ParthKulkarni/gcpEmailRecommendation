In the uses where I've had to deal with Wordpress and other web cruft
I got the impression that the "latest version" upgrade system was
generally preferred. I don't recall any issues with plugins on upgrade
either. Perhaps others had to deal with that. I know the Firefox XUL
to WebExtension transition is going to be hell, at least for me.

Debian actually gets a reasonable amount of income from DebConf each
year (but miniscule compared to RH of course). All the things you
mention (except venues for some DebConf years) are donated by our
sponsors and partners. We don't really attempt to determine the
financial value of these donations but I agree they are quite
significant. OTOH I think that other distros like FreeBSD get probably
similar levels of donations.
BTW, thanks for putting the value of Debian into perspective in this paragraph.

The statistics page lists one page for security statistics:
https://wiki.debian.org/Statistics
http://security-metrics.debian.net/
Unfortunately it is out of date (probably since the git transition)
and doesn't seem to include the info you want.
