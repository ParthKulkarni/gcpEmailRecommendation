What, do that and add the gnupg direct dependency to all the other
tests ?  But then I have to do more work if and when gnupg1 is
removed.  Worse, that will show up as a regression...
I do think I want a thing to _just_ trigger tests, without changing
how they are run, or causing other kinds of lossage.

Yes, well, that woudl be lovely, but it's a lot more work (both
sociopolitical and technical).  My current proposal is quite easy from
both points of view.
So I think I'll update my proposed text and file a bug against
autopkgtest asking for this new hint restriction to be documented.
Thanks,
Ian.
