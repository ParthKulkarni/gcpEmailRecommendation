  Description     : Clean, simple and fast Python access to public hydrology & climatology data
Ulmo retrieves and parses datasets from the web, and returns simple Python
data structures that can be easily pulled into more sophisticated tools such
as pandas. It caches datasets locally and harvests updates as needed.
A variety of datasets and services are supported, including the USGS National
Water Information System, USGS National Elevation Dataset services, USGS
Earth Resources Observation Systems services, NASA Daymet weather data, and
several more both available and planned.
This will be packaged under the Science Team.
