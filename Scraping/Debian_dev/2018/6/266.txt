  Description     : Collects PostgreSQL statistics the same way as a sysstat
tool
Collects PostgreSQL statistics, and either saves them in CSV files or print
them on the stdout
This simple tool is very handy to follow the internal activity of a PostgreSQL
instance, in a similar way to sar ou vmstat. I don't know of a similar tool.
It is bare C depending only on libpq-dev & postgresql-server-dev-all for
building. No package depends on it.
This is ideal for my first package with compilation. My first tests are
encouraging. I intend to maintain it as part of my current job. The upstream
author is a colleague.
Maintenance would be in Debian PostgreSQL Maintainers.
