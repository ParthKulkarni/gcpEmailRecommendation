Hibernation (suspend-to-disk) works on some hardware, but whether it works
is very dependent on the combination of hardware, drivers and kernel,
and when it fails it leads to a bad user experience. Desktop environment
developers do not want to offer a feature by default while knowing that
it is unreliable (and not feasible for them to fix).
If you're using GNOME and your particular hardware can hibernate and
resume successfully, you might find
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/755/hibernate-status-button/
useful.
