There seems to be no common ground between the behaviour that you are
reporting, and the bug you've followed up to.  One is about a failure to
suspend, and the other is about problems with subsequently restoring.
Also, both of these problems are almost certainly due to very specific
features of your particular combination of hardware, configuration and
software.
I would therefore suggest that you ask for help on the normal support
channels (i.e. debian-user@lists.debian.org and #debian on IRC -- see
the wiki for more info: https://www.debian.org/support).
Hopefully you will then get advice on how to diagnose your problem,
which will either point towards configuration changes required, or might
reveal a bug in a particular package.
Bugs against particular packages are _much_ more likely to get fixed
than bugs against 'general', so please don't be discouraged from
reporting them by the fact that I'm now going to close this bug.  I'm
doing that because it's not really actionable as it stands.
Cheers, Phil.
