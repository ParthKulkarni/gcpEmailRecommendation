Quoting Pierre-Elliott BÃ©cue <becue@crans.org>:
 - those who do not have the (e.g. programming language)
   skills to change code anyway
 - those who do not want to compile code, if applicable
 - those who like to let the distro care about dependencies
 - those who administrate multiple services and like to see
   everything in "dpkg -l" etc.
 - those who like to go with the distro release cycle
 - those who like the distro do DFSG compliance work
Having gitlab etc. packaged in Debian makes a lot of sense,
but it does not mean "eat your own dogfood" is the best rule
for the specific case of salsa.d.o.
Cheers
