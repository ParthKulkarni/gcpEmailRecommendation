  Description     : Baedal-Minjok decorative Korean fonts
 Baedal-Minjok fonts are decorative Korean font families. They
 are intentionally designed to look old-styled. They are designed
 designed for Baedal-Minjok food delivery service.
 .
 This package includes 5 font families; BMDOHYEON, BMHANNA_11yrs,
 BMJUA, BMKIRANGHAERANG and BMYEONSUNG.
 - It replaces fonts-woowa-hanna package from the same upstream. It
   includes its upgraded version in different name and 4 other
   font families.
 - Unfortunately, the upstream didn't set versions or update
   dates on their fonts. So I have no choice but to use their release
   announce date as the version.
