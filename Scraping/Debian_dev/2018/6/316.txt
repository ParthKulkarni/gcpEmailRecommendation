Hello,

I was able to find an archive of this here: https://alioth-archive.debian.org/svn/gcccvs.tar.xz
It looks like this may not have yet been ported to salsa. In addition it looks like its using svn which AFAIK is not supported by GitLab. It would require a bit of work to get this moved over to git.
Getting a conversation started with the debian-gcc [1] mailing list seems like a logical next step.
