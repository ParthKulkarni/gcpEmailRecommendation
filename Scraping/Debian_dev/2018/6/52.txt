 Description     : Queueing Networks and Markov chains analysis for Octave
The queueing package provides functions for queueing networks and 
Markov chains analysis. This package can be used to compute 
steady-state performance measures for open, closed and mixed networks 
with single or multiple job classes. Mean Value Analysis (MVA), 
convolution, and various bounding techniques are implemented. 
Furthermore, several transient and steady-state performance measures 
for Markov chains can be computed, such as state occupancy 
probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged sojourn times 
and so forth. Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains are 
supported.
This package will be maintained in the realm of the Debian Octave 
Group. A preliminary version of the package can be built using 
git-buildpackage from the repository 
https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-octave-team/octave-queueing.git
