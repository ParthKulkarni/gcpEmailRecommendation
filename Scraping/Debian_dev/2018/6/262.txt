No, have just one specific test for gnupg1, and only add it there.

Do what I did for MySQL once I noticed it isn't in buster: drop that
specific test.

A regression in what sense and for what package? The package that
dropped gnupg1? Maybe that is good because than you are notified that
you need to update your test in order for gnupg1 to be dropped. And true
that once the gnupg1 is removed from testing your regression test fails,
but then the baseline is failing. This also means it isn't a regression
in the britney sense for any package. Of course you would want your test
to pass, but at the moment gnupg is removed, it isn't harming anything
in the current setup. The release team was very clear, they want to
compare to the current state in testing.

Fair. But now if gnupg1 is removed, you'll not notice that you should
remove your trigger.

Ack.

I think you should go ahead.
