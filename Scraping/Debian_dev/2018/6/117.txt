In my opinion the biggest blocker is that, the node.js ecosystem is
not security supported by Debian because of libv8 not being security
supported. In addition, there is no-one in Debian tracking
vulnerabilities in the node.js ecosystem reported by NodeSecurity and
importing the issues into the Debian security tracker. I used to do
this occasionally to see how many issues we were ignoring but it needs
to be done in a systematic way by people interested in JavaScript
security. The biggest problem with this is that a lot of NodeSecurity
reported issues do not get a CVE, this seems to be improving though.
After that, the ones that did get a CVE were either still reserved
with no info or in 'check' mode and needed to be classed as not-for-us
or applying to a certain Debian package.

I have no idea how that compares with the security support provided by
GitLab upstream though.
