Thanks Simon for the clarification.

I read that, but I was not sure if my interpretation was right. Indeed,
my conclusions were different.

Only tangentially related: does that mean that we can drop the checks
for the presence of deb-systemd-helper in the postrm maintainer scripts
injected by dh_installsystemd (for example [1]) and simplify them a bit?

I'm not sure. I'm probably not aware of all the intricacies involved in
writing robust maintainer scripts, thus I modelled dh_installsystemduser
after what dh_installsystemd does. The maintainer scripts code blocks
injected by dh_installsystemd stop services in prerm and deactivate them
in postrm, but I don't know if there is a technical reason for that.
The code blocks injected by dh_installsystemduser do not start or stop
services, and I don't see a reason why disabling the services could not
be done in prerm. The relevant maintainr script code block is here [2].
Thanks.
Cheers,
Dan
