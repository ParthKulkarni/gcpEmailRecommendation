I request assistance with maintaining the sparkleshare package. I’m not
currently using SparkleShare myself, and unfortunately, it seems that
my systemd do not have the correct versions of some dependencies, so I
cannot test SparkleShare properly, since when I did test it, it would
run, but I receive reports that it no longer works.
Also, despite the fact I possess more knowledge about packaging Mono
libraries and apps than I would like to, I still do not have the full
picture of the things, and I am not always able to pinpoint the source
of an issue with Mono apps.
It would be great if someone helped me, since I’m not sure how much time
will it take for me to solve it (https://bugs.debian.org/899223).
The package description is:
 SparkleShare is a collaboration and sharing tool that is designed to keep
 things simple and to stay out of your way. It allows you to instantly sync
 with any Git repository you have access to.
 .
 SparkleShare can be used as a rough alternative to web services such as
 Dropbox or Ubuntu One.
 .
 Though SparkleShare is not made to be a graphical frontend for git or a backup
 tool, it may be useful for other kinds of purposes as well, like backing up
 small files or monitoring your favourite project.
