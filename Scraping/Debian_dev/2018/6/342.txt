Description     : Emacs major mode for editing comma/char separated values
This package implements CSV mode, a major mode for editing records
in a generalized CSV (character-separated values) format.  It binds
finds with prefix ".csv" to `csv-mode' in `auto-mode-alist'.
.
CSV mode supports operations such as the following: 
.
  * sort lexicographically and numerically on a specified
    field or column.
  * kill and yank fields or columns.  C-c C-k can kill more than one
    field at once, but multiple killed fields can be yanked only as a
    fixed group equivalent to a single field.
  * align fields into columns
  * interchange rows and columns.  For details, see
    the documentation for the individual commands.
.
CSV mode can recognize fields separated by any of several single
characters, specified by the value of the customizable user option
`csv-separators'.  CSV data fields can be delimited by quote
characters (and must if they contain separator characters).  This
implementation supports quoted fields, where the quote characters
allowed are specified by the value of the customizable user option
`csv-field-quotes'.  By default, the only separator is a comma and
the only field quote is a double quote.
.
CSV mode commands ignore blank lines and comment lines beginning
with the value of the buffer local variable `csv-comment-start',
which by default is #.  The user interface is similar to that of
the standard commands `sort-fields' and `sort-numeric-fields', but
see the major mode documentation below.
.
The global minor mode `csv-field-index-mode' provides display of
the current field index in the mode line, cf. `line-number-mode'
and `column-number-mode'.  It is on by default.

Yes, that description should probably be cut down a bit more...
I am packaging this software for the Debian Emacsen Team as a
contribution to the effort of breaking up emacs-goodies-el into a
series of elpafied packages.  It will be team maintained, and I will
require a sponsor for the initial upload.  This bug blocks #495989
