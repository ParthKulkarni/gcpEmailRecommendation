Developers' Reference says to put them in the oldlibs section:

I don't think you can do it with apt, but deborphan can identify
various kinds of unneeded packages and aptitude should be able to
select and remove packages in the oldlibs section.
Reassigning this to debian-handbook, which doesn't seem to say anything
about this currently.
