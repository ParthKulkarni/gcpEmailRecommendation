Package: debian-policy
Version: 4.1.4.1
Severity: normal
User: debian-policy@packages.debian.org
Usertags: normative discussion
Thank you for pointing out that Policy's description is out-of-date,
Ian, and for the patch.  I agree that it captures the consensus we
established in that previous discussion, but it's not quite right for
Policy yet; see below.
Firstly, I think this text should go in section 4.1, and the description
of the Standards-Version field should have a link back to section 4.1.
The text in 4.1 is currently a bit strong about how often people have to
check Policy, so we can replace that with your new text.

The upgrading checklist explicitly states that it does not have
normative status, so a 'should not' requirement should not defer to it.
Also, IMO this should be 'must' rather than 'should' -- since it is pure
metadata, bumping the s-v without reviewing the changes to Policy can
only be counterproductive.
How about:
    The Standards-Version must not be updated except after reviewing the
    changes between the old and the new versions of the standards (the
    upgrading checklist[hyperlink] can help with this task).

s/As a rule of thumb, each package should be/It is recommended that each package be/
"Should" carries the weight of a bug of 'important' severity, but I
don't think that was your intent (and I don't think it should have
been).
If others are happy with the changes in this e-mail I'll prepare a patch
for seconding.
