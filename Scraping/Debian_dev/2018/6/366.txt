  Description     : find and delete duplicated mails in a Maildir
 This program searches a set of mail folders for duplicated mails.  Those
 are notorious when you receive the same notification via different ways,
 get mails crossposted to multiple mailing lists, etc.  Detection is done
 by coercing a subset of headers into a canonical form and taking a hash.
 As protection against false positives, message bodies of candidate
 duplicates are diffed as well, rejecting those that don't look similar
 enough.  This should avoid most decoration from mailing lists.
 .
 Only the Maildir format is supported.
