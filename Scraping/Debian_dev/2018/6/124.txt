These seem likely to be dead upstream. Anyone maintaining these will
need to be prepared to be their de facto upstream developer.

I'm not sure whether gnome-ppp was ever a GNOME project: it's from the
era of packages being named "gnome-whatever" because they are designed
to run under GNOME, rather than because they are part of GNOME. It
depends on libglade2, which has itself been obsolete for a long time
(see #895517). Again, I'm far from surprised if it's dead upstream.

NetworkManager supports PPPOE (e.g. ADSL), and cellular modems (3G, etc.)
via ModemManager. It doesn't support the analogue dial-up modems that
were popular 10-20 years ago. I don't think the major NM alternatives
(wicd, ConnMan etc.) support those either.
As with any no-longer-common hardware, support for this class of hardware
in Debian depends on someone doing the work. If someone cares enough
about dial-up modems to want to maintain wvdial and/or gnome-ppp in
Debian, then they should adopt wvstreams too.
Alternatives to wvdial include pppconfig (orphaned) or configuring
pppd by writing configuration files directly (hardly user-friendly,
but probably enough for retrocomputing enthusiasts).
