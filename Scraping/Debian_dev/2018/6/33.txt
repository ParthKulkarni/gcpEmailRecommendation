Hi,
I have achieved after 6 years to get adobe relicense type 1 code.
Since 1985 type fonts hinting was not free, now it is free software [1].
The license choosen by adobe is unfortunalty apache 2 and thus not compatible 
with GPL2 only.
They are about 7146 fonts that need to be audited and add correct copyright to 
debian/copyright.
I plan to close #694308 and  ask upstream to fix #665334.
We will need to do a ful rebuilt of fontforge fonts in order to add the new 
code to actual fonts.
Lintian warning will be fixed.
Thank
