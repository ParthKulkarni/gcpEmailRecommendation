That isn't a bug, either in python3.7 or in
the Python libraries.
A package build-depending (or presumably test-depending) on python3-foo 
often expects to get "foo" for all supported python3 versions but the 
dependency structure only enforces that foo will be available for the 
default python3 version.
Afaict this deficiency is well-known but the possible fixes may well be 
worse than the current deficiancy.
