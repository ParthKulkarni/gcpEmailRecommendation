Packages does not imply automation (lots of people maintain machines by
logging into each one and running apt by hand and $EDITOR on their
configuration files; I suspect this applies to the majority of desktops
and laptops by people on this list), and git repositories do not imply
not-automation.  Those are simply transport mechanisms for bits and the
level of automation you use is not decided by git-vs-packages.
For debian.org hosts, the choice is primarily a matter of privilege
separation: Service owners generally don't have root on the hosts, and
so if they are to be able to update the service configuration, the
service must run as a user they have access to or we need to build
control planes with access controls which allow service owners to
control their service.  DSA has root on the hosts and maintain those,
but we don't run all our services, so we'd rather not be on the critical
path for updating various services (which we'd need to be if those came
from packages).
