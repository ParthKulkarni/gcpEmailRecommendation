Buildds don't run the packaged version either, and this contributes to
it being much harder than it should be to set up local buildd
infrastructure. There are good reasons for this from the admin's POV,
but the side-effects are signifcant and I'd like us to try harder to
use packaged stuff.
But I've not done the necessary work myself, so can't really
complain. I just observe that it is a real issue for people setting up
their own CI infra. One day I may have the tuits to improve things in
this area (I plan to start retiring soon, which might help, or may
simply introduce different distractions :-)
