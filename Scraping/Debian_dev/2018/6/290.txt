Welcome to the world of Debian packaging! As this is a Go written software, I
suggest you to take a look to the packaging page of the Debian Go Team[0].
[0] https://go-team.pages.debian.net/packaging.html
Particularly, I invite you to co-maintain your package with the team. We have
several Prometheus exporters packaged and can help you with yours. Packaging it
under the team's umbrella will also help you get a sponsor faster (yes, you do
need a sponsor!). You might want to visit #debian-prometheus and #debian-golang
IRC channels.
Cheers,
Rul
