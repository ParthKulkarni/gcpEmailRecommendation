When I say "the circumstances were different", I mean that at the time,
it was about paying people to do release management of testing, and that
it was originally suggested by the DPL. In this case, it is about
paying people to work on the exact opposite of the release train, and it
has no DPL involvement.
I think it would be fine if Debian were to, occasionally, sponsor people
to work on LTS, provided that it does not become a "LTS is only paid for
by Debian" situation. Say, we could do a matching drive or something
along those lines (as in, "Debian will match any sponsorship up to
XYZ").
Of course you might reasonably disagree with that opinion, but "the
circumstances are different" is a simple statement of fact ;-)

Yes, the latter is very important, I agree -- that's why I was opposed
to mentioning Freexian as "doing LTS" on the website; even if that ends
up being the truth in practice, I think we should absolutely not
perpetuate the idea that that is the *only* possibility.
