  Description     : Prometheus exporter that exposes process metrics from procfs
Some apps are impractical to instrument directly, either because you don't
control the code or they're written in a language that isn't easy to instrument
with Prometheus. This exporter solves that issue by mining process metrics from
procfs.
This exporter goes beyond the metrics currently offered by
prometheus-node-exporter, as it is able to expose detailed metrics about
a user-definable list of process names / regex patterns.
I plan to maintain this package with the assistance of the Debian Go
packaging team. Benjamin Drung <bdrung@debian.org> will sponsor me.
