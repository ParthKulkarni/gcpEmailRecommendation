It actually doesn't, because installing systemd by itself does not
change the init system.  (As in, the dependency is wrong, and if it
wants to declare Â«only useful with systemd as initÂ», it should depend on
systemd-sysv, not systemd.)  (Also the bits downthread wrt
Depends/Recommends.)

Having some bits of a package not functional if Recommends is not
satisfied is fine, see
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=119517 for a TC ruling
on it.
