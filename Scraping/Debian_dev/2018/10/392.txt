  Description     : libvma is a LD_PRELOAD-able library that boosts performance
libvma is a LD_PRELOAD-able library that boosts performance of TCP and UDP traffic.
It allows application written over standard socket API to handle fast path data
traffic from user space over Ethernet and/or Infiniband with full network stack
bypass and get better throughput, latency and packets/sec rate.
No application binary change is required for that.
libvma is supported by RDMA capable devices that support "verbs" 
IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET QP for Ethernet and/or IBV_QPT_UD QP for IPoIB.
