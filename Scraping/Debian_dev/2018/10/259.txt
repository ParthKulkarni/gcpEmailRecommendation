	AFAICT, that‚Äôs, for the most part, untrue.  For instance, I do
	/not/ run Avahi (why for?), Cups (I use an ad-hoc wrapper around
	foo2zjs instead), Pulseaudio (for there‚Äôs ALSA, but also NAS and
	JACK should I need them), D-Bus (although I admit I‚Äôve had to
	implement a ‚Äúno-dbus.perl‚Äù stub non-server to work around
	Bug#868453), or Wayland (huh?)  And I suppose those who run
	Systemd don‚Äôt run SysVinit just as well.
	Granted, I know of no way to use audio on Debian GNU/Linux without
	ALSA; and I know of no way to avoid running PAM, either.
	Now, unless I be mistaken, ‚Äúbuild profiles,‚Äù as suggested in
	this subthread, are meant to allow for building packages with
	specific changes to their run-time library dependencies?
	Frankly, I don‚Äôt see much of a problem with that ‚Äì assuming that
	the libraries are ‚Äúwell-behaving,‚Äù that is.  I can see an
	application's run-time dependency on the presence of client
	PostgreSQL, MySQL and MS SQL libraries at run-time as necessary
	evil.  Having that application pull one or more of the respective
	servers per Depends: is something I tend to consider a bug.
	(BTW, while we're at it, could someone please explain me what
	tinysshd [1] does need systemd for?  Or why installing neomutt
	has to invite gnupg along?)
