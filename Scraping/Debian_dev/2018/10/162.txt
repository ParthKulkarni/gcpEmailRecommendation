  Description     : A helper script for continuous testing written in Python
Continuous testing helper, adapted from [1], but which makes no
assumption about what tests you might want to run continuously while
developing. For more information, see this blog post[2].
Any command supplied to the script will be run once and then repeated
any time a file in the current working directory changes, except for
files excluded using .conttest-excludes as described below.
Note that ANY command you supply the script will be run, so be careful.
You have been warned!
