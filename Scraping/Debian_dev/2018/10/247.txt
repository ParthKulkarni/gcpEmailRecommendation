I am not typical then.

Obviously I am not the "you" you mean here. I learned quite a lot about 
Systemd as I integrated it in my Linux training slides. I even like 
quite some of the features.
Still two of my server VMs are running Devuan already â€“ one with 
sysvinit and another one with OpenRC â€“ and I am pondering to switch over 
this laptop too. And the one running Debian also runs sysvinit.
I think it is helpful to mainly speak of oneself here instead of 
claiming what (apparent) others may like or do.
That written, I estimate or guess that the people preferring to use 
another initialization system than the initialization system in Systemd 
are in the minority. Yet, this minority might be larger than you think. 
Especially as popularity contest does not count the ones who switched 
over to Devuan:
% apt show popularity-contest
[â€¦]
Description: Vote for your favourite packages automatically
 The popularity-contest package sets up a cron job that will
 periodically anonymously submit to the Devuan developers
 statistics about the most used packages on this system.
[â€¦]
Thanks,
