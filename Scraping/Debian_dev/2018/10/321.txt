It's not just gnupg. gnupg depends on (among many other things) 
gpg-agent, which depends on pinentry, which used to pull in X libraries 
unless I remembered to manually install pinentry-curses first.
It has always been a pain and it is not justified just to check the 
content of a maildir in a server.
PGP-signed mail is an highly advanced feature, so I do not think that it 
is unreasonable to expect from users who want to use it to also install 
gnupg.

No: it is also TOTALLY POINTLESS to even just automatically verify 
received emails because any result is meaningless unless the local user 
has manually configured local sources of trust. Which requires 
installing AND configuring gnupg, so again the user has to know about 
it.
