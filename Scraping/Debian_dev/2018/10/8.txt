  Description     : an extensible parallel graph library for graph analytics
The Combinatorial BLAS (CombBLAS) is an extensible distributed-memory
parallel graph library offering a small but powerful set of linear
algebra primitives specifically targeting graph analytics.
- The Combinatorial BLAS development influences the Graph BLAS
  standardization process. 
- It achieves scalability via its two dimensional distribution and
  coarse-grained parallelism. 
- CombBLAS powers HipMCL, a highly-scalable parallel implementation of
  the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL).
- Operations among sparse matrices and vectors use arbitrary user
  defined semirings.
combblas implements AWPM, a row permutation algorithm now offered in
superlu-dist as an alternative to the non-free MC64 algorithm.
Consequently combblas will make superlu-dist much more useful than it
has been in the past.
It will be packaged under the Debian Science team alongside
superlu-dist.
