Oof. How do I find them out? The BTS shows no RC bugs, not even
ones tagged as affects src:sysvinit, and the QA page
https://packages.qa.debian.org/s/sysvinit.html also doesn‚Äôt.

I cannot do *everything*, mostly because of time constraints
(I can barely keep up with my own projects), but also because
I don‚Äôt have those problems people have or stuff works for me
(if it doesn‚Äôt, I usually investigate).
I‚Äôm, however, willing to have someone who steps up as sysvinit
bug supervisor or triage person, of sorts, throw bugs into my
general direction, so I can see whether I can reproduce or even
fix it.
The QA page says: ‚ÄúThe BTS contains patches fixing 49 bugs (63
if counting merged bugs), consider including or untagging them.‚Äù
This is indeed a sad state. What does the team ‚ÄúDebian sysvinit
maintainers‚Äù say about those? I don‚Äôt think that a continuing
growth of NMUs is going to cut it, with this amount of patches.
