1. You need to recompile these packages, this is not something an average
user or even sysadmin knows how to do.
2. You lose basic functionality like being able to shutdown from a GUI.

Alas, dependency chains say otherwise.
What almost all of those packages want is logind functionality, but I quite
don't get "why?".  The only answer I received so far is "multiseat". 
Except, logind doesn't allow multiple GUI logins on the same machine for the
same user no matter how many seats you connect from (this worked correctly
before!), and it offers additional features for non-GUI logins either.  So
all this functionality does is telling you that user X is logged on via
vt/pty Y.  I recall a command named "who" on stone age Unices, and wonder
what the whole hassle is about...
But, it's not entirely unreasonable to provide the dbus interface logind
users want.  I'd prefer such an interface be a shim to standard Unix (like
who -- utmp), which would have the added benefit of working on BSD and Hurd
(which I don't personally care about but some do) -- yet such an daemon
would have to be written.  I for one don't volunteer to write it by
tomorrow...  Thus, let's use elogind which actually exists.
Other pieces are some power management that has been moved into logind, etc.

Exactly!  Almost any changes in recent years were entirely because "systemd
wants X".  Thus, no wonders people are angry because of unnecessary work.
Meow.
