(previously sent to debian-devel by mistake)
Recently I tried to upgrade my freeradius package to 3.0.16+dfsg-4.1+b1
And after that my laptop with wpa_supplicant stops authenticate:
excerpt from wpa_supplicant
network={
        ssid=<<...>
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        group=CCMP
        eap=TLS
        identity=<<...>>
        ca_cert=<<...>>
        client_cert=<<...>>
        private_key=<<...>>
        private_key_passwd=<<...>>
}
with version 3.0.16+dfsg-3+b1 everything works ok.
Any hints what to check in logs?
On first sight there is nothing strange in freeradius logs, but
wpa_suplicant seems to wait for reply.
My other devices (Windows 7 + some androids ) works.
