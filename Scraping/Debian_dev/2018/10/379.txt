  Description     : useful callbacks once descendant images have loaded
 waitForImages also supports both images referenced in CSS, such as the
 'background-image' property, and images referenced in element
attributes such
 as srcset. Images referenced in attributes can also be a
comma-separated list
 of images.
 .
 It can be useful when WebKit incorrectly reports element
dimensions/offsets on
 document ready, because it has not calculated their descendant 'img'
 dimensions yet.
 .
 Supports all browsers you probably care about.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This is a dependency of gitlab 10. It uses grunt to build and is a
complex module.
