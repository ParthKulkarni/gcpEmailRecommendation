	Reading tinysshd(8), I see that it can also be started from
	tcpserver(8) or BusyBox‚Äô tcpsvd (which doesn‚Äôt seem to be
	available in Debian yet.)  Or, I suppose, socat(1)?  Say:
# setsid -- socat  TCP6-LISTEN:22,fork \
      EXEC:"tinysshd -v /etc/tinyssh/sshkeydir" & 
	Contrary to running from Inetd, the use of the likes of socat(1)
	and tcpserver(8) can readily be adapted for an init.d script
	(or, rather, init-d-script(5) DAEMON wrapper), which in turn
	allows the user to control the daemon with the usual service(8).
	Examples (untested) of such a wrapper and a corresponding init.d
	script are MIMEd.

	You know, in almost twenty years of using GNU/Linux, I think
	it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm requested /not/ to report bugs and
	contribute patches.  How times did change, indeed!
