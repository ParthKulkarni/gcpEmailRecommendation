Hi Holger,
I’ve been totally shocked by the Subject, but reading on…

… this applies to the shim only. I was a bit surprised seeing on
someone else’s system that it was no longer installable, but almost
all systemd-free systems of people I know do not use the shim anyway,
so I’d take the Subject line with a few grains of salt.
With only two modified binary packages (policykit-1 and udisks2) I’ve
got a complete KDE environment running, except for network-manager,
without the shim. People who do not use the full desktop environments
(but the leaner ones, or just a window manager, or no X11 at all) have
no problems with the current situation.

Why would sysvinit need uploads? It’s largely working software
that needs few changes. I personally find upload frequency as
a measurement misused too often: sure, no uploads raises some
questions, but more than four to six uploads a year should, in
my opinion, raise even more questions (namely whether the soft‐
ware is ripe and stable enough in the first place).

OK, but please keep *me* in Cc, as d-devel is too high-traffic
for me to be subscribed.
Thanks,
