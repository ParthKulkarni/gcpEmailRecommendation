  Description     : Eclipse Help System Core
The Platform User Assistance component provides the mechanisms for making the
Eclipse applications easier to use. These mechanisms are made available
throughout usage life cycle and include initial user experience (welcome),
online documentation, dynamic help, search, cheat sheets, automation and
samples.
The goal of this component is to make it easier for users to accomplish their
tasks in Eclipse applications. While it includes the traditional book-based
help system, increasing effort is spent towards bringing assistance closer to
the user. Welcome, dynamic help view and cheat sheets are examples of user
assistance vehicles that can be used that way.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to update
the Eclipse ecosystem in Debian and complete the transition to Java 11.
