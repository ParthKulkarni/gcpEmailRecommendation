Hi
What is wrong with the following doc-base file:
---cut here---
Document: theme-d-user-guide
Title: Theme-D User Guide
Author: Tommi Höynälänmaa
Abstract:
  This document describes the basic operations with Theme-D, such as
  compiling, linking, and running programs. The document contains
  installation instructions for Theme-D, too.
Section: Programming/Theme-D
Format: PDF
Files: /usr/share/doc/theme-d-doc/theme-d-user-guide.pdf
---cut here---
Installing this file with install-docs gives the following error:
---
Error in `theme-d-doc.doc-base.theme-d-user-guide', line 11: all 
`Format' sections are invalid.
