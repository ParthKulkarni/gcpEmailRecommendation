  Programming Lang: C
  Description     : fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression
The supported formats are:
 . 
 DEFLATE (raw)
 zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
 gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)
 libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster than the zlib
 library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
 processors. In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
 that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".
libdeflate is a recommended dependency of htslib and will be team-maintained by
Debian Med
