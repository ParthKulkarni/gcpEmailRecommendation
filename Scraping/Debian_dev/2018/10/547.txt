  Description     : Dynamically configure Linux netconsole
Netconsole is a Linux kernel module that sends all kernel log messages
over the network to another computer. It was designed to be as
instantaneous as possible, to enable the logging of even the most
critical kernel bugs. It works from IRQ contexts as well, and does not
enable interrupts while sending packets. Due to these unique needs, only
IP networks, UDP packets and Ethernet devices are supported.
This package contains a netconsole service that dynamically configures
netconsole by configuring one or more hosts by their names or IP
addresses.
The initscripts package on CentOS 7 provides a /etc/init.d/netconsole
initscript that can configure netconsole by just configuring SYSLOGADDR.
The functionality is similar, but this package also provides also a
systemd service and allows to specify multiple log hosts.
Beside the CentOS script, I found no other tool doing this job.
Therefore I published our inhouse package to get it into Debian.
I am open to merge this script and service into a other packages if this
package is considered to be too small.
