  Description     : tool to create RPM repository metadata (C implementation)
  The createrepo_c tool generates the repodata directory and XML metadata
  that makes up a repository of RPM packages. This repository format is
  supported by apt-rpm, red-carpet(zen), smartpm, up2date, yast, and yum.
  This package is similar to the apt-ftparchive or reprepro commands, but for
  working with RPM repositories.
I intend to package this tool since it seems to be the preferred
alternative to the already packaged createrepo Python tool (and many
thanks to Mike Miller for maintaining that package!) in at least
the Fedora RPM packaging community.  Thus it might be useful for people
maintaining their own repositories of RPM-packaged software; there is
no reason not to be able to do that on a Debian system :)
(and for anybody keeping track, yes, for the present I have copied
 the long description of the createrepo package verbatim; if this
 turns out to be undesirable, I will of course change it before
 uploading)
G'luck,
Peter
