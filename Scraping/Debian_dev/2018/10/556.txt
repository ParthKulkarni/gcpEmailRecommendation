  Description     : General-Purpose Mail Filter
Mailfromd is a general-purpose mail filtering daemon.  It is able to
interact with any MTA that supports milter or pmilter protocol, such
as Sendmail, Postfix and MeTA1.  It is able to filter both incoming
and outgoing messages using criteria of arbitrary complexity, supplied
by the administrator in the form of a script file.
(Include the long description here.)
I use this program in my job and like to have a package there, so I
can publish it for others, too.  I'll maintain it as all my packages
in salsa.
