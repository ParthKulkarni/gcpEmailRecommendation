Ah.  Well, then, thanks for your consideration.
I hope you are able to use most of what I did.  I expect if you rebase
my series onto your master with a conflict strategy of just taking
master's version, you'll have most of it done.
As an aside, I looked for a way to *extend* rather than *specify* the
flake8 ignore list.  I found that it is possible to fish the existing
list out of the relevant python module, but I didn't know how to write
such a programmatic thing in setup.cfg.
Regards,
Ian.
