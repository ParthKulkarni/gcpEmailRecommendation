Please ask user questions on debian-user, not debian-devel.  You might
also try to find a freeradius  support channel; they are likely to have
both a mailing list and an IRC channel (I don't use freeradius, so I
don't know).
>From your description, this could certainly be a bug in either
freeradius or wpa_supplicant, but doing the triage on a user support
mailing list is usually very helpful to the maintainer.  Afterwards, you
can use reportbug to file a bug for the correct package.  debian-devel
is not the correct mailing list for this.
