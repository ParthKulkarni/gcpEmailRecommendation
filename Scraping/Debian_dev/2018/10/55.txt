It seems that papers are The communication channel for C++ ISO, it might be useful to write paper,

Not necessarily, it is possible to have patron that will agree to present it on behalf of authors. 
Initial feedback and possibly patrons (I believe some other word is used to describe them) can be 
found in ISO C++ forums [0].
Well, there are about three meetings per year, and I doubt the next meeting will be some soft of 
"definitive" (or will it?), so paper could be reviewed in subsequent meetings.
