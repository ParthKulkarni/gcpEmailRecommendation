Care to specify what's unstable with btrfs RAID?  Any non-experimental level
(experimental include 5/6, 3-way mirroring, etc) has no known stability
issues; what's left are missing optimizations or features that'd be nice to
have.
But Ian is right -- this has turned into advocacy again; I'd be happy to
discuss filesystem issues with you privately or on linux-btrfs if you wish.
My point earlier in this subthread was that mounting RAIDs doesn't fit well
within systemd's event scheme and would require at least some rethinking --
even using static ordering would work better.
Meow!
