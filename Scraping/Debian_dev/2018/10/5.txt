The whole point of our taking over the alioth lists service
was that maintainers do not need to update maintainers field
(e.g. several thousand packages for perl packages only).
Now imagine that alioth lists service was eventually taken over
by DSA and the new canonical domain became debian.org again.
Should maintainers update their packages again? That's what we
want to avoid, hence suggesting to keep lists.alioth.d.o instead
of alioth-lists.d.n.
BTW, you can take a look at the Mailman list of lists to find out
if some list was migrated:
https://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo
https://alioth-lists.debian.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo
(linked from alioth-lists.d.n home page)
Cheers,
Alex
