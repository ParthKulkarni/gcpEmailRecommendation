Which Debian branch of GnuPG is this error happening with?
(I assume it's Sid/Unstable).
Reason I ask is last year I had a problem sending my rsa4096 key to
keyring.debian.org when using gpg from Sid, but it worked fine when using gpg
from Stretch (and using the exact same keyring in both cases).  Offhand I don't
recall the exact error I got but I remember it seemed nonsensical to the acutal
issue, and now "feels similar" to the error you're receiving.
If by chance you've run into the same issue, that would be interesting.
