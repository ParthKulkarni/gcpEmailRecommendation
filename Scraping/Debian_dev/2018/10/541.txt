Greetings.
You can complain to the police but nobody can solve your problem.I dont live in your country.So nobody can track me even for 9 weeks.
Your system was infected by my virus.We recorded you through your web-camera,at the moment you went to the porn web-page.And now we have the record of you,touching your intimate parts. 
Your contacts are copied on my disc so if you ask me to keep this secret you must pay 560 $ in bitcoin.
Enter this bitcoin address - 1Dh84yRHy7WEyweiUfvYqNzrNNDnZQPYgJ
(use it like your credit card number). You have 24 hours after reading this message for making the payment.
Bye.Think about the ignominy.
