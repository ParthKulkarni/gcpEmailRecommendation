Thank you for all your work on sysvinit, especially insserv.
Please note that I said only *sysvinit-core* the pid 1 ELF is stable.
No worries, we will not let it be and disappear by itself.
My plan is to do something to please those who want to kill sysvinit by
keeping it in a "healthy" state, althrough only cosmetic changes are
needed.
Cheers,
Benda
