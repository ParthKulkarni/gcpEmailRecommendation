   or class file

   separate views for projects, packages, types and memebers.

   interface

   resolve, method level edit, import assistance, quick fix and quick
   assist
In addition to these workbench elements the following functions are provided:
 * Refactoring support - Extract Method, Safe Rename and Moving with
   reference updates, Self Encapsulate Field etc.
 * Java searching - find declarations of and/or references to packages,
   types, methods, and fields, scoped to the workspace, a working set,
   or the current selection.
 * Java aware structured compare - determine and present changes to
   individual Java methods. It supports to replace individual Java elements
   with a version of an element from the local history.
