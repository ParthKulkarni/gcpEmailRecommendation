Dear -devel,
It has been quite a while since the last call for volunteers to join the
the FTP team. As Ganneff put it so well in the last request[0], I will
hereby quote him below.
(I would only add that such work is rather under appreciated; don't do
this for the glory or public recognition.)

  Have you ever felt compelled to do the hard groundwork? Ever wanted
  to help at a nicely central place inside Debian? Or just want to
  write some Python code and still look for a good place to stick
  it in?
  Here we are. Come join the Nav^Wteam. Just sign over there to the
  right, or even easier, mail us. We won't bite you, thats for sure. At
  least not right away. :)
  The criteria are the same as always: You need to be a DD (except for
  coding only, though it helps to know the usual flow of a package) and
  you need to be able to deal with the existing team members.
  An occasional flame should also not disturb you, if you are working
  in the NEW queue you will stand between the people uploading and the
  packages entering the archive, rejecting something is not always
  liked much. (But you often get positive replies and thanks, to keep
  your spirits up :) ).
  And - if you get headaches when reading legal texts - we all do. But
  it is needed and things like NEW are mainly about that, the ftpteam
  is *the* one place to decide if something is ok for Debian to
  distribute or not, and you will have to take this decision. (Yes,
  there is more, but this is the main point you are going to check).
  Obviously the other points we made in earlier mails, like [1], still
  apply too.

As it happens, there will be an IRC meeting on #debian-ftp this Friday
8pm UTC, ie:
  $ date --date="Fri Oct 12 20:00:00 UTC 2018" [2]
If you would like to join, or have any quick questions, please
email ftpmaster@debian.org.
