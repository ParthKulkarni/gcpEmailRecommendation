  Description     : Common Print Dialog Backends - CUPS/IPP Backend
This package needs cpdb-libs, ITP here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=911335
This is already packaged for Ubuntu. This is the long description of
the Ubuntu package:
 This is the CUPS/IPP backend for print dialogs using the Common Print
 Dialog Backends concept of OpenPrinting. It makes the dialog list CUPS
 print queues and driverless-capable IPP printers and allows printing
 on these using the dialog.
The idea is to decouple the print dialog's GUI code (GTK, Qt,
LibreOffice, ... The frontends) from the code which communicates with
actual print technologies (CUPS, IPP, Google Cloud Print, Save to
File, ... The backends) to make them independently
interchangable. This way one can do things like
- Add a new print technology and it is immediately available for all
  GUI apps. Especially an online print service provider could simply
  put its backend into the Snap Store and asks his Linux users to
  install it.
- A change in a print technology, for example new functionality in
  CUPS, can be covered by simply updating the CUPS backend. No need to
  change all GUI libraries.
- User logs in for Google Cloud Print once and not separately for each
  GUI platform to get his cloud printers into all the apps.
- In case of a security bug in the communication code with one print
  technology only the backend needs to get fixed, not several GUI
  libs.
This package contains the backend for access local and remote CUPS
print queues and IPP network printers. It supplies information about
the printers, their capabilities, and user-settable options and it
passes print jobs on to printers. The print dialogs (using cpdb-libs)
connect to this backend via D-Bus. To do so, it is enough to have this
backend package installed.
For this to work at least one application with a print dialog using
cpdb-libs must be installed.
Of the GUIs LibreOffice already supports this system and only needs to
get rebuilt with this library. Patches for GTK and a modified Qt print
dialog are in the works.
All packages are already available as Ubuntu packages in Ubuntu's
Universe part. The maintenance in Debian should be done in the Debian
Printing Team.
I am not a Debian Developer but OdyX (Didier Raboud, odyx@debian.org)
is willing to upload these packages.
