No need to introduce build profiles: if somebody cares enough they can 
spend one hour to revive my libsystemd-dummy package, which I wrote 
because I did not want to use conditional build dependencies for the 
hurd/kfreebsd ports in my own packages.
It allows to rebuild any package with no source changes at all and 
remove the libsystemd dependency.
As usual, there is a lot of talking and not much code.
