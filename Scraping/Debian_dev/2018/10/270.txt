Well, reporting bugs about software you don't care or patches you don't
test is not always useful. For example, you clearly didn't test your
wrapper (shebang is #!/usr/sh) nor the init script
(/lib/init/init-d-script is expecting the daemon to fork). The
maintainer would have to do the testing, possibly the immediate fixes
and all the future maintenance. Just for you to make a point.
