I publish .deb packages for them (although not for all arches yet).

Oh? For me, Ctrl-Alt-Backspace+Ctrl-Alt-Del works.

Huh?

I don‚Äôt know about ‚Äúlogind functionality‚Äù and don‚Äôt care about it,
I‚Äôve never needed it, and disqualifying sysvinit because it doesn‚Äôt
have it is plain wrong because there are a *lot* of use cases that
don‚Äôt need it.
Perhaps it‚Äôd be better if it were available. But the counter-reaction
of disqualifying if it‚Äôs not available is invalid.

Eh? The acpi command works, and sysfs writes do so, too‚Ä¶

Hm. I didn‚Äôt follow those changes, but if it‚Äôs that‚Ä¶ good point.
