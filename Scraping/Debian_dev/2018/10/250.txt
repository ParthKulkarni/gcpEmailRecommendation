Thanks. Doing just that already in a way I currently can.
People are already working on it. They do not discuss this on this list, 
but on the debian-init-diversity list that has been announced in this 
thread.
I am not helping as a developer at the moment, but I helped quite a bit 
with bringing people together and collecting information as I navigate 
in both communities (Debian and Devuan). KatolaZ already works on 
examing the current status and coming up with a plan, including updating 
to latest upstream release of sysvinit. Also there is coordination work 
on elogind. It is already packaged in Devuan, but there has been work 
for having it packaged in Debian as well.
Obviously there won't be new package releases tomorrow. So it is good to 
allow it to take some time, also for involved Debian and Devuan 
developers to learn to know and trust each other and agree on a work 
flow.
Hopefully this is the start of a long-overdue healing process.
What happens if we stop the flame war, if we stop hurting each other and 
start accepting that many use Systemd, some use something different and 
the world is big enough for both groups? And what happens when it is not 
even about which is right and which is wrong, what happens by just 
accepting that both are *different*?
Also to me sysvinit is not an end in itself, even tough it has some 
priority right now to get the package maintained again. I quite like 
runit for example.
