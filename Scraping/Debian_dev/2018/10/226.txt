It's not only that. The sysvinit package *itself* doesn't actually do much
really. That's not to downplay your past involvement there of course (e. g.
developing insserv alone was a huge task), but the *real* maintenance is in all
the packages that *ship* SysV init scripts.
SysV init leaves all the really hard problems to these, as it cannot really do
much by itself. That's a fact that people that keep yelling "but SysV init was
so easy!" keep finessing..
So "how many RC bugs does sysvinit have" is a completely useless metric IMHO.
