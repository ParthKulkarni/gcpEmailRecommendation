Package: general
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
Whenever my computer goes to sleep, either through closing the laptop or
calling systemctl suspend/hibernate, it does not start again and the
computer must be hard reset.  I have been having this problem for
several weeks, after a fairly large upgrade.
I have determined the following facts trying to figure it out:
 - It seems to be never quite getting to sleep (even though the screen
   goes off), because it uses up more battery than it did when it would
   successfully sleep.
 - I cannot SSH into the computer after closing and opening it.
 - I am unable to use CTRL+ALT+F* to get to a terminal.
 - Tapping the power button does nothing.
 - The problem happens when I don't even start the X server, so it is
   something more fundamental.
I have looked in /var/log/syslog to try to figure out something, but it
seems to say that it goes to sleep successfully:
systemd[1]: Reached target Sleep.
systemd[1]: Starting Suspend...
systemd-sleep[742]: Suspending system...
kernel: [   36.022321] PM: suspend entry (deep)
The next line is the next time I boot the computer after forcing it to
turn off.
I have seen a few other bugs about the computer freezing when
suspending, but they are all older than this problem, and some of them
were only under certain conditions.  This always happens no matter what
the circumstances are.
If anybody has an idea to help me provide more information, please let
me know.
