	Indeed; I even said that much in my posting.  (Meanwhile, one
	another issue I‚Äôve found is that the wrapper lacks a trailing
	‚Äòexit 1‚Äô.)
	AFAICT, the init.d script issue can be fixed by adding
	START_ARGS=--background there.

	I disagree; to the best of my knowledge, anyone can do the
	testing and suggest any fixes he or she deems necessary.  As
	such, having an issue recorded in the BTS is preferable to not
	having it recorded, and having a (semi-correct) patch on file
	is preferable to not having any patch at all.
	If maintainer decides resolving the issue is not worth the
	effort, the (wishlist) bug can stay in the BTS indefinitely.
	The maintainer can as well make /that/ a point.
