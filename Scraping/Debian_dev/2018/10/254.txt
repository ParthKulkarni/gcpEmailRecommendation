It might be feasible to introduce nosystemd build profiles to Debian
source packages and then create a shed/bikeshed/PPA (once that
infrastructure exists) that contains rebuilds using that build
profile. That would allow Devuan's libsystemd stripping to be
completely merged into Debian source packages and infrastructure. I
guess Devuan have other changes that might be easier or harder to
merge too though.
