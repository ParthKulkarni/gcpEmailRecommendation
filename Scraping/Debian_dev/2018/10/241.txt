I don't think that is only the smaller issue we are facing here. The
bigger "problems" for those who do not like systemd will be:
- the typical package maintainer won't test initscripts
- more and more upstreams are shipping systemd services only and skip
init script creation.
For my packages I can state that I do not have a single machine which is
not using systemd - and to be honest - I won't waste my time in
writing/debugging initscripts. If there is one, I'll review it if it
looks sane and then maybe ship it. And I'm saying "maybe" here, as for
new packages, I will NOT shit it as active init script because I will
only put stuff in my packages I have tested well enough.
After using a lot of systemd now I will never go back to init scripts.
Systemd comes with a steep learning curve, but one you've stated using
its features you'll never go back.
