  Description     : fake certificate authority for test use
 trustme is a tiny Python package that gives you a fake certificate authority
 (CA) that you can use to generate fake TLS certificates to use in tests. Its
 only useful purpose is as a dependency of test suites.
This is a (test) dependency of trio, ITP bug #900296
I intend to join the DPMT and then maintain it there, but as I'm not a
member right now, I will take things a step at a time and get it into
unstable first.
