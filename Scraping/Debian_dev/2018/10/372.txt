yes, but when using your repo one has to add your key to the keys apt
trusts, and this is something completly different than using proper
backports.
(I'm very thankful for you providing your repo, but it's not the same as
if those packages were on backports.)
(A workaround for those not wanting to add your key to apt is of course
to download your sources and rebuild them, and then put in a repo of
local packages, and then tell apt to trust that local key. It's more
work but c'est la vie.)
