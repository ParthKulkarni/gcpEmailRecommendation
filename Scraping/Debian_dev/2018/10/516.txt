  Description     : identification of known plasmids from whole-genome sequencing reads
 PlasmidSeeker is a k-mer based program for the identification of known
 plasmids from bacterial whole genome sequencing reads.
 .
 PlasmidSeeker that enables the detection of plasmids from bacterial WGS
 data without read assembly. The PlasmidSeeker algorithm is based on
 k-mers and uses k-mer abundance to distinguish between plasmid and
 bacterial sequences. The performance of PlasmidSeeker was tested on a set
 of simulated and real bacterial WGS samples, resulting in 100%
 sensitivity and 99.98% specificity.
