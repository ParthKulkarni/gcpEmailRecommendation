I got this mail forwarded, I'm not on any of the lists, don't

Definitely.  But the deadline for this meeting was last Moday.
But for an author it would probably be useful to be at the Meeting

of what the different people in the committee think.
And try to find co-authors inside the committee.
And then write a paper for the next meeting Feb 18-23, 2019 in Kona, HI.
