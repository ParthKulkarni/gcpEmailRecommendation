  Description     : Common Print Dialog Backends - Print-to-File Backend
This package needs cpdb-libs, ITP here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=911335
This is already packaged for Ubuntu. This is the long description of
the Ubuntu package:
 This is the Print-to-File backend for print dialogs using the Common Print
 Dialog Backends concept of OpenPrinting. It makes the dialog list one
 single print queue and if you print to it, the data is put into a PDF file
 and not sent to a printer.
The idea is to decouple the print dialog's GUI code (GTK, Qt,
LibreOffice, ... The frontends) from the code which communicates with
actual print technologies (CUPS, IPP, Google Cloud Print, Save to
File, ... The backends) to make them independently
interchangable. This way one can do things like
- Add a new print technology and it is immediately available for all
  GUI apps. Especially an online print service provider could simply
  put its backend into the Snap Store and asks his Linux users to
  install it.
- A change in a print technology, for example new functionality in
  CUPS, can be covered by simply updating the CUPS backend. No need to
  change all GUI libraries.
- User logs in for Google Cloud Print once and not separately for each
  GUI platform to get his cloud printers into all the apps.
- In case of a security bug in the communication code with one print
  technology only the backend needs to get fixed, not several GUI
  libs.
This package contains a backend which creates a printer entry in all
print dialogs (using cpdb-libs) which drops jobs sent to it simply in
PDF files. The backend instructs the print dialogs to show a printer
entry and to pop-up a "Save as ..." dialog when hitting "Print"
(and/or selecting the "Destination File Name" option).
For this to work at least one application with a print dialog using
cpdb-libs must be installed.
Of the GUIs LibreOffice already supports this system and only needs to
get rebuilt with this library. Patches for GTK and a modified Qt print
dialog are in the works.
All packages are already available as Ubuntu packages in Ubuntu's
Universe part. The maintenance in Debian should be done in the Debian
Printing Team.
I am not a Debian Developer but OdyX (Didier Raboud, odyx@debian.org)
is willing to upload these packages.
