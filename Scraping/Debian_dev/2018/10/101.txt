  Description     : a Python frontend to CGAL's 3D mesh generators
pygalmesh makes it easy to create high-quality 3D volume and surface meshes.
CGAL offers two different approaches for mesh generation:
 -   Meshes defined implicitly by level sets of functions.
 -   Meshes defined by a set of bounding planes.
pygalmesh provides a front-end to the first approach, which has the following advantages and disadvantages:
 -   All boundary points are guaranteed to be in the level set within any specified residual. This results in smooth curved surfaces.
 -   Sharp intersections of subdomains (e.g., in unions or differences of sets) need to be specified manually (via feature edges, see below), which can be tedious.
On the other hand, the bounding-plane approach (realized by mshr), has the following properties:
 -   Smooth, curved domains are approximated by a set of bounding planes, resulting in more of less visible edges.
 -   Intersections of domains can be computed automatically, so domain unions etc. have sharp edges where they belong.
CGAL (C++) is not so easy to use.  pygalmesh helps make it that much
more accessible, and complements mshr.
