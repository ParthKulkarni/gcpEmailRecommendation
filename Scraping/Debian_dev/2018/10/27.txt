Thanks a lot Shengjing, that was very helpful! :)
Thanks to the debug logging I've been able to identify that my issue
is actually the known issue referenced in our bug tracker as #870806.
trying to enable the ipv6 module didn't work for me (for whatever
reason it doesn't load, with no error), but temporarily adding the
disable-ipv6 to ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf did the trick!
It works now. Thanks again! :)
