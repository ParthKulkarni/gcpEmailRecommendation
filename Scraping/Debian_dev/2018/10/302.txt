libgpgme is communicating with gnupg in the background - having
libgpgme without gnupg itself will render the library completely
unusable and break existing users of the library.
Therefore, if you have something that wants libgpgme, you will also
always want gnupg installed to ensure the library functionality is
actually provided.
Also, gnupg/libgpgme are tiny, so you won't waste much disk space
here. No daemon gets run in the background as well, so I don't
understand the need to create lots of additional work to free up a
tiny amount of disk space. If you don't need the feature, don't use
it. If you do need the feature, great, it's readily available for you.
Cheers,
