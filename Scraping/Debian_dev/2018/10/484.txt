Dear Maintainer,
Adding Kovri to the Debian ecosystem would provide users a lightweight
entry into the I2P network.
Kovri is a C++ implementation of an I2P router. I2P is an overlay
network, providing users with secure, private access to a number of
services.
I plan to create a Kovri package for Debian. Building Kovri on Debian
will involve statically building and linking against the most recent
Boost and OpenSSL libraries.
The package will be built from source against release tags.
Updates to the package will mirror project releases.
Kovri is licensed under the BSD-3 license.
Currently, Kovri is in alpha-release. 
Nightly release downloads will soon be available from the project's GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/kovri-project/kovri
Thank you for your time considering this package proposal.
