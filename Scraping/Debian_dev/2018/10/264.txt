	I suppose I can agree with that.  AFAICR, the libgpgme11
	maintainer was concerned that some of the users of the library
	may break if gnupg is not available.  (Investigating that is
	still in my to-do list.  Donâ€™t hold your breath, however.)

	In the context of the present discussion, the libgpgme11 package
	/is/ useful even in absence of gnupg: it allows neomutt to be
	installed.  Much like libmariadbclient18 allows me to install
	exim4-daemon-heavy, and libxt6 does the same for mpg123.
	The fact that Iâ€™m not interested in transparent OpenPGP support
	under NeoMutt, or that I donâ€™t typically run mpg123(1) under X
	(much less use NAS for audio output), or that I never use MariaDB
	at all, â€“ is utterly irrelevant.

	Could you please elaborate on that?
