Okay, let's add some numbers:
Debian and all the other Debian derived distributions:
- 3109 (=1,55%) installations of sysvinit-core
- 2031 (=1,01%) installations of runit -68 runit-systemd -6 of runit-
sysv (counted above already)
- 110 (=0,05) installations of openrc, but it works on top of sysvinit
- https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=sysvinit (and so on)
Devuan:
- 2578 installations of sysvinit-core (and I just added two more by 
installing popularity-contest on my Devuan based server VMs)
- 27 installations of runit
- 141 installations of openrc, installations of openrc, but it works on 
top of sysvinit
- http://popcon.devuan.org/tmp-www/by_inst.html
So Devuan almost doubles the percentage of sysvinit-core  installations.
A minority? Yes. But a sizable one.
Thanks,
