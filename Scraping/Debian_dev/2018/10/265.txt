tinysshd requires some kind of socket server to run. It could run from
inetd, so if you were an actual user, I would propose you file a bug
report against the package to let the maintainer knows the dependency is
too strong for your use (and maybe propose a patch to integrate with
inetd).
As you are not, please, do not. Our resources are scarce and we already
cater for the need of many non-existent users.
