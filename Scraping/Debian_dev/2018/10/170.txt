Nothing.  There is in reality no team any more.  There seem to be just
me, who is lacking both the required spare time and interest to do good
job, but still try to fix the gravest problems while waiting for someone
with time and interest to adapt the packages.  The packages have been in
need of adoption for several years, as can be seen from for example
<URL: https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=pkg-sysvinit-devel%40lists.alioth.debian.org >.
I believe Andreas Henriksson is right, the packages are going to be
removed unless someone with time and interest show up to take care of
them.  A good start would be to split initscripts off from the sysvinit
binary packages, to let them live separate lives.  It will be sad, but
the proper way for Debian to handle unmaintained packages in a sad
state.
