Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I haven't used sn, a small NNTP server for leaf sites, in many years.
There has been no active upstream for even more years. The package will
be auto-removed from testing soon because of #909928.
If the person willing to take this package over has no upload rights,
I'd be happy to sponsor uploads until he/she gets DM status.
Cheers,
-Hilko
