The person who want to salvage the package probably should also wait 
for two
weeks after initial public contact, then send another public email, 
wait for
another two weeks, send another public notification email before doing 
actual
salvaging efforts (moving packaging repo, uploading packages, etc). 
Idea
copied from QA/MIA process 
(https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/MIATeam).
I know that I am someone who also lacks time quite often. But still, 
this kills a lot of velocity and I wonder how many people will be 
motivated enough to follow up through a whole month of waiting. On the 
other hand if that gives you a blanket "it's now yours, do with it as 
you see fit, including taking over ownership", maybe that's not so bad.
(There's of course also the question of VAC notices to crawl, though. If 
someone went away for a longer period of time with an intent to come 
back, it should be fair game to fix the package and own related breakage 
but obviously not to just hijack it away from the original maintainer.)
Kind regards
