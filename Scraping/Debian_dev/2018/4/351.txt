To the end of clear communication for people wondering what's going on

No, it would just somewhat defuse the complaint that he appeared to be
an absent maintainer.

No, but if you've been clear about why the package is stuck at
$4-year-old-version then a) someone is probably less likely to hijack
it in the first place, and b) when someone does hijack it, and you
complain and some people critise you (likely round here) you can point
to your clear communication, and it is obvious to all that the
hijackers have acted unreasonably (as opposed to it looking a bit
50:50 and everyone taking sides).
I don't have a dog in this fight (I have never heard of any of these
people or packages before). I was just expressing the impression I
formed when Rolf claimed he'd been clear about why there had been no
uploads for 4 years. I'm not suggesting that no-communication
hijacking is OK.

Possibly. Bit late for that if you ask me :-)
Anyway. I'm going cycling for a week, so you are very unlikely to hear
from me again on this matter, which, as you say, is probably a good
thing. :-)
