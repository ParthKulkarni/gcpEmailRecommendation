It is not for us to decide what tools our users should use,
we should support them no matter what tools they have to use.

Why does legacy "*must*" die?
Upstream support is mainly relevant for security support.
In real life many of our users have to support huge amounts of code 
written in Python 2.
There are big codebases written in languages like Tcl around,
so still using Python 2 doesn't strike me as exceptionally weird.

Maintaining the Python 2 interpreter is actually reasonably trivial.
Three years after the release of jessie there has been one security
update for python2.7 in jessie, this is not a problematic package,
and there are other distributions who will create security fixes
for the Python 2 interpreter for many years to come).
