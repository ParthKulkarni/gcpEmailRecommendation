Except that the reasoning breaks down when you consider that
auto-removal of packages is a function of the package management front
end and not of dpkg itself (which is responsible for validating the
relationships between packages).
There are plenty of available tools to identify system cruft, including
packages that are no longer receiving security support and packages
which do not exist in the current suite/release for which the system is
configured.
