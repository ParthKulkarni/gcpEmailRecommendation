This sounds like a feature?  I think that would be exactly the right
outcome.  It avoids any possibility of confusion with this rogue 5.0
version, if it should turn up somewhere else.
Version numbers are composed of integers.  Getting another integer is
free, and there is not a limited supply.  We won't run out, and missing
sequence numbers cause no problems in the world.
