Description: brush library for mypaint
 MyPaint is a pressure- and tilt-sensitive painting program which works well
 with Wacom graphics tablets and other similar devices. It comes with a large
 brush collection including charcoal and ink to emulate real media, but the
 highly configurable brush engine allows you to experiment with your own
 brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
Other Info
--------------
This package and mypaint-brushes are required dependencies for gimp 2.10.
The next major release of mypaint will use this library also.
I intend to help maintain this package under the Debian Multimedia Team.
Packaging is at
https://salsa.debian.org/multimedia-team/libmypaint
Thanks,
