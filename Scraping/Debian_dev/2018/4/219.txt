Oops.  Thank you for providing ammunition for my position (as
discussed in another thread here on -devel) that reusing version
numbers for different contents is a bad idea, even when the previous
versioni was not accepted into the Debian archive but merely shared
with (for example) reviewers or ftpmasters.

It strikes me that if there were comments in the ftpmaster database
suggestiong the package should be rejected, the package ought to have
been rejected, rather than languishing in a queue.  That would have
brought the confusion to light right away.
But maybe I don't understand the process.

I see little reason why it shouldn't be.  DYK if it is in the same
postgresql instance ?  We already mirror the main archive db to
somewhere dd's can read it.
