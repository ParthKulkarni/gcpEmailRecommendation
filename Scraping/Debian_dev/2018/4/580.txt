I know very little about the details of OpenStack, but in case a somewhat 
parallel example is useful, that's approximately what Django will do.  
Bullseye will be Django 2.0, which is Python 3 only.  Buster is the pivot 
release where the third party elements of the Django ecosystem almost all 
support Python 3, so transition is possible to make ready for an all Python 3 
future. (AIUI anyway, I'm not a Django maintainer)
