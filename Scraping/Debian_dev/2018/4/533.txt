I can understand that the above is one reading of Scott's mail, but I
personally didn't take anything super negatively w.r.t. "nothing more
than the opinions of the lintian maintainers".
But again, in the context of my mail, I was (quite verbosely) outlining
that Lintian's findings may sometimes be, on their own, sufficient
justifications for a REJECT, and sometimes not.
Even a Lintian warning may still result in a REJECT if it was clear it
was 100% apt, and represents something we don't want in the archive.

I agree, people who feel strongly this issue is misclassified could best
instigate action by taking this discussion to a bug (perhaps spilling
over to debian-devel if it is in fact of interest to the wider project
for discussion).
