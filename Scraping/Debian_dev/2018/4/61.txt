  Description     : NXEngine is a Cave Story game engine clone
 A complete clone of the game and rewritten in action/adventure masterpiece
 Cave Story using the NXEngine engine.
 .
 Chances are that the differences of the game are imperceptible or
 too small for most, but worth bearing in mind.
 .
 In this adventure you control a little amnesiac who runs around helping these
 rabbit creatures called Mimigas as he tries to find his way out of
 the giant cave to the floating island that makes up the game setting.
