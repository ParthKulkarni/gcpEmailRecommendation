  Description     : date and time library based on the C++11/14/17 <chrono> header
"date.h" is a header-only library which builds upon <chrono>. It adds some new
duration types, and new time_point types. It also adds "field" types such as
year_month_day which is a struct {year, month, day}. And it provides convenient
means to convert between the "field" types and the time_point types.
tz.h" / "tz.cpp" are a timezone library built on top of the "date.h" library.
This timezone library is a complete parser of the IANA timezone database. It
provides for an easy way to access all of the data in this database, using the
types from "date.h" and <chrono>. The IANA database also includes data on leap
seconds, and this library provides utilities to compute with that information
as well.
"iso_week.h" is a header-only library built on top of the "date.h" library
which implements the ISO week date calendar.
"julian.h" is a header-only library built on top of the "date.h" library which
implements a proleptic Julian calendar which is fully interoperable with
everything above.
"islamic.h" is a header-only library built on top of the "date.h" library which
implements a proleptic Islamic calendar which is fully interoperable with
everything above.
This is a C++ library which implements all relevant parts to date. Including the
timezone data and leap seconds. Further more I intend to package the library
sqlpp11 and the connector libraries.
