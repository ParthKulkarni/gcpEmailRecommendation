Not just as a comaintainer according to https://salsa.debian.org/debian
/gjots2/commit/202ae3f586cbe3a7867b881389382d3ee75b39a9 which relegated
the previous maintainer to Uploaders.
There were half a dozen commits before that, starting as NMUs, then
adding the comaintainer, then another handful of changes culminating in
the above but all on the same day
