In the last upload of googletest -- December 2016 -- I successfully used "gbp 
buildpackage".  Today, with zero changes, it fails to actually do the build: 
it skips from configuration to running tests.
The rules file [1] is, I think, pretty simple: there are overrides for  
dh_auto_configure , _test, _install, and _clean; nothing else.  Am I missing 
something?
