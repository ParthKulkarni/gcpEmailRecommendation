  Description     : Utility to connect to detached interactive programs
Detachtty lets you run interactive programs non-interactively, and connect
to them over the network when you do need to interact with them. It is
somewhat similar to screen, but it is less feature-rich, therefore
lighter and with less dependencies. It allows to connect to programs
running on remote hosts by mean of secure SSH connections.
Detachtty was removed from Debian because it was dead upstream. Now the
upstream development has been resumed by another developer, so it is
sensible to repackage it.
