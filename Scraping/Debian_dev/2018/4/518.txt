Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
Hi,
I'm looking for co-maintainers for the swi-prolog package, which is a
Prolog interpreter, written in C (core) and Prolog itself (most of its
libraries). SWI-Prolog is still under active development, especially
compared to other Prolog implementations (most of which are stalled
nowadays).
There is a kind of infrastructure built around it, which includes
additional libraries [libraries] (shipped as packages, currently 233
additional packages total) and some related tools and projects (e. g.,
swish [swish], which is a web-interface for Prolog development). As far
as I know Debian does not contain anything of it besides SWI-Prolog
itself. So, ideally I'd like it (the swi-prolog package and other
prospective packages from SWI-Prolog infrastructure) to be
team-maintained. Of course, currently such team do not exist, but in
case there are volunteers to help with, let's just start it.
Please, share your thoughts and ideas.
