  Description     : Google No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA widget for Django forms
This python module allows creating Django forms with Google's "No
CAPTCHA" reCAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA version 2. This is the only available
reCAPTCHA since Google switched off version 1 in March 2018.
This package is not a dependency for others, its building dependencies
are already satisfied and has no running dependencies to other python
modules.
I already have a working debian package, tested against oldstable and
Django 1.8. I plan on git pushing the repository on salsa as soon as
possible. I will need a sponsor to upload that package and I would
certainly maintain it within a team if that's more appropriate.
