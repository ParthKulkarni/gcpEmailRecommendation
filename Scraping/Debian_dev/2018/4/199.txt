  Description     : A debouncer written in Go
 This package provides a debouncer func. The most typical use case would be
 the user typing a text into a form; the UI needs an update, but let's wait
 for a break.
Reasoning: Needed by hugo >= 0.38.1
 commands: Handle mass content etc. edits in server mode
 .
 If you do massive search/replace in /content in a running hugo server
 you get flooded with filesystem events -- which does not look pretty.
 .
 It would be better to schedule a full rebuild for when it slows down.
 .
 Fixes #4563 ( https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4563 )
