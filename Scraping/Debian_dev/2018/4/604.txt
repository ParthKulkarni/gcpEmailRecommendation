I would do (2), assuming the patches are small.  The effort of
carrying a patch is much reduced if there is no upstream who are
constantly releasing new versions for us to rebase our patch onto.
But I appreciate that (4) looks attractive.

Thanks for this excellent attitude.  I do appreciate you doing this
work to benefit others, even though it is an inconvenience to your own
projects.
