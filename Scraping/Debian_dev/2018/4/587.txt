Rumor has it that RHEL 8 will be dropping Python 2 while (finally!)
adding Python 3. Much of that is fueled by the Deprecated
Functionality[*] section of the RHEL 7.5 Release Notes wherein it
states, "Python 2 will be replaced with Python 3 in the next Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) major release."
