I think this is not really desirable.  It would be much better to make
the syntax a subset of 5322, at least.

Luckily there is an established transformation for encoding non-ascii
in 5322 headers.  But TBH I'm not sure what /usr/sbin/sendmail does
with un-encoded UTF-8 in To.  Ideally, at least when invoked in
"submission" mode, it would encode it.
