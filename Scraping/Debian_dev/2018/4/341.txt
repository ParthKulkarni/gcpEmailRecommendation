Since I was CC'd on this email and I've filed several Serious bugs for
this issue, here is what I've been using lately:
"It is my understanding that is a RC bug for package to recommend a
library that has been removed from Testing because recommended
packages won't be auto-removed on upgrade."
That means users will have libraries installed that will not get any
security support. I think that's an RC issue.
Thanks,
