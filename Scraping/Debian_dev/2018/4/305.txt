That is not my understanding. alioth/collab-maint and its successor
salsa/debian simply provide a public GIT repository without the need
to set up a separate salsa project.
See https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth/PackagingProject
The fact that *technically* every DM has write permission on the repo
does not make committing permitted. There is just no technical barrier,
only the social one.
