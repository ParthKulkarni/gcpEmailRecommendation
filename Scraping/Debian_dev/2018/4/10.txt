Description: brushes for paint apps
 MyPaint is a pressure- and tilt-sensitive painting program which works well
 with Wacom graphics tablets and other similar devices. It comes with a large
 brush collection including charcoal and ink to emulate real media, but the
 highly configurable brush engine allows you to experiment with your own
 brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.
 .
 This package contains the virtual paint brushes.
Other Info
--------------
This package and libmypaint are required dependencies for gimp 2.10.
There is an obvious duplication here with the brushes included in
Debian's mypaint package. I expect a future mypaint release will no
longer include the brushes and will depend on the mypaint-brushes
package. We could drop the bundled brushes from our mypaint package
now, but upstream advised to wait a bit longer for
https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/pull/538 to be approved.
I intend to help maintain this package under the Debian Multimedia Team.
Packaging is at
https://salsa.debian.org/multimedia-team/mypaint-brushes
