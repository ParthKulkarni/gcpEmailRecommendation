I have *not* removed Python 2 support. Only services are switched to
Python 3 by default. It was a hard switch as they couldn't reasonably be
dual-python (too much packaging work for no real benefits). For example,
there's still Python 2 modules for clients.
I would like to start dropping Python 2 as early as possible though. The
only question that remains is: how many people still have Python 2 only
code using clients.
Cheers,
