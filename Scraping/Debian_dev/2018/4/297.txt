I'm sure that doubts don't help here.

 gjots2 (2.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

 gjots2 (2.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * revert the package hijack in 2.4.1-3 by
     Athos Ribeiro <athoscribeiro@gmail.com>
     Lucas Kanashiro <kanashiro@debian.org>
     who couldn't even be bothered to clean up after their mess
   * move VCS URIs to point to github
   * update my copyright to 2018
So we have all the ingredients for a fight:
  * several people
  * something that is important to all of them
  * different views on it
And that dispute is now on  d-devel@l.d.o. ...
What I would like to see:
  * the involved people express that gjots2 is important to them
  * the involved people talk (email) with each other
  * discussion on common goals
  * some minor acknowledge on this fight, something like "hmm, yes that wasn't productive"
And thing that I real would like to see
  * VCS  URI to Salsa, the logical succesor of https://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/gjots2.git
