I suspect developers may be reading too much into Lintian output,
reading them as "Please remove your Python 2.x module".
The motivating behind these tags were to prevent new Python 2.x
packages being added to the archive (due to habit if anything
else!) unless they were needed or requested, of course.
Suggestions for rewording gratefully received.
