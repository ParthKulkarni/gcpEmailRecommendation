  Description     : Converting between ipython notebooks and sphinx docs
nb2plots converts Jupyter notebooks to ReST files for Sphinx, and back again.
Nb2plots assumes that the ReST document will become the source for your Sphinx
web pages, but also for future versions of the notebook. The notebook may serve
as a draft for the polished ReST page, and an output format from the Sphinx
build.
this is needed by python-networkx/2.1
