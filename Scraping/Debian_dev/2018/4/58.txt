  Description     : digital radio transmission decoder
 The successor to multimon, with support for more modes and improved
 compatibility with moderns systems. It decodes the following digital
 transmission modes commonly found on VHF/UHF bands:
 .
   POCSAG512 POCSAG1200 POCSAG2400
   FLEX
   EAS
   UFSK1200 CLIPFSK AFSK1200 AFSK2400 AFSK2400_2 AFSK2400_3
   HAPN4800
   FSK9600
   DTMF
   ZVEI1 ZVEI2 ZVEI3 DZVEI PZVEI
   EEA EIA CCIR
   MORSE CW
   X10
 .
 Multiple decoders can run concurrently on the same signal, which is
 provided via a file or a pipe. Common setups are: a radio connected
 via a sound card (may require modifications to the radio); samples
 provided via a GNU Radio sink or a UDP audio stream from gqrx (via
 netcat and sox).
The original multimon is no longer being developed and I have found
this fork to be more capable (e.g. POCSAG works out of the box). When
someone points towards multimon today they usually mean multimon-ng.
It is in active development and upstream agrees that it would be good
to include it in Debian.
