  Description     : A super simple logger for Go
 Go's standard logger is fairly limited. As result, kazilion alternatives
 loggers have been written.
 .
 All of these are wonderful. They can make your logs look colorful and
 pretty, buffer things in complicated ways, format data for ElasticSearch,
 and more.
 .
 Cool, but all I wanted is something super dumb, that just exposes
 log.Info(), log.Error() and a couple other standard levels.
 .
 I don't need a super flexible kitchen sink. Just something super basic
 and trivial to use. I just want it to handle different log levels, and
 be able to write simple logs to stderr, to a local file, to syslog and
 to the Windows event log.
 .
 So, here's one more logging library for Go. The dumbest of them
 all. Enjoy.
