Based on my research I think you can drop the old links since they were
only required until everything was rebuilt and the symlinks were
re-created during the 0.9.8 -> 1.0.0 transition. We are past that point
now.

There is no need to push this stable. There is nothing wrong with it as
far as I can tell.
Upstream considers that script as legacy (and it not part of the
testsuite) and I just wanted to make sure that we are ready to drop that
script once upstream decides to remove it. Also not to be part of any
further fallout.
