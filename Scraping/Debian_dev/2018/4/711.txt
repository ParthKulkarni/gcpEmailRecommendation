  Description     : a spaceship bridge simulator game
EmptyEpsilon places you in the roles of a spaceship's bridge officers, like
those seen in Star Trek. While you can play EmptyEpsilon alone or with friends,
the best experience involves 6 players working together on each ship.
Each officer fills a unique role: Captain, Helms, Weapons, Relay, Science, and
Engineering. Except for the Captain, each officer operates part of the ship
through a specialized screen. The Captain relies on their trusty crew to report
information and follow orders.
Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator was the inspiration for EmptyEpsilon. It is
pretty good as a bridge simulator, but had some issues that EmptyEpsilon's
authors wanted to fix. Moreover, Artemis is not opensource.
