No, this is not what I am saying.
Helmut has the ambition to make the whole archive cross-buildable.
If this will ever happen it will be afterÂ buster.
It is clear that the problem at hand is not trivial,
otherwise Helmut would have submitted a patch long ago.
If spending a not so small amount of my time on making ~ 100 additional 
packages cross-buildable in buster is considered a very high priority
for Debian, please make your case why it is.
Trying to bully me into doing this work with very aggressive wording
"is more important for you than continued support for python2" and
zero explanation why doing this specific work would be important
for Debian is pretty rude.
