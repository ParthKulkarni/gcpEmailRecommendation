  Description     : Access HMI, AIA and MDI data with Python
The drms module provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing
HMI, AIA and MDI data with Python. It uses the publicly accessible
Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) server by default, but can
also be used with local NetDRMS sites.
The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) are instruments aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) designed to study oscillations and the magnetic field at the solar
surface. The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) is the predecessor to the
current HMI and was launched aboard the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO). HMI and MDI observe the full solar disk at 6173 â„«
with high resolution, while AIA is designed to study the solar corona.
This package is a new dependency of sunpy.
I will maintain it within the Debian Astro team.
Best regards
Ole
