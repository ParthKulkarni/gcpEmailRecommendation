not really afraid. "optically not nice", "slightly confusing" and
"irreversible" are the words I would use.

It is somehow part of the version number, but not in the filenames.
This is not a problem when an epoch is used for a change in the upstream 
version numbering scheme.

Yes.
As far as I understand it a mistake happened back in 2006 when a new 
upstream version was uploaded as .tar.gz instead of .orig.tar.gz and
.diff.gz.
Correcting this mistake was correct, but it did not require an epoch.
> Now I should upload it as 1:1.0.51-12 and be done with it?
I don't see a reason for touching the 1:1.0.51-1 changelog entry,
files like moon-buggy_1.0.51-1.dsc or moon-buggy_1.0.51-1_amd64.deb
are no longer unique in the history of Debian and this cannot be
undone.
Uploading with a new changelog entry for 1:1.0.51-12 added on top
of the current 1:1.0.51-1 entry is the best option.
> No renaming of the orig.tar to 1.0.51+really1.0.51 neccessary?
This is not necessary, unless I miss something there was never before
a (different) moon-buggy_1.0.51.orig.tar.gz in Debian.
