  Description     : support for rsync from Emacs dired buffers
This package adds a single command dired-rsync which allows the user
to copy marked files in a dired buffer via rsync. This is useful,
especially for large files, because the copy happens in the
background and doesn’t lock up Emacs. It is also more efficient than
using TRAMP's own encoding methods for moving data between systems.
