If the package that you removed has no reverse dependencies, then it will be
automatically removed (decrufted), and the removal will be mentioned in
https://ftp-master.debian.org/removals.txt
If it has rdeps and can't be auto-removed, then it will appear in the cruft report:
https://ftp-master.debian.org/cruft-report-daily.txt
But please do not remove packages that have rdeps if you don't have a transition
plan. Otherwise you're just going to cause your package to get stuck in unstable
with no chance to migrate to testing, see e.g.:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=894560
By all means start getting your rdeps / python2 apps ported, so that when the
time comes, dropping Python 2 support won't be such a daunting task.
Cheers,
