  Description     : Collection of assets to dynamically generate documentation
 Swagger UI is a collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that allow
 anyone to visualize and interact with an API's resources without needing to
 have any implementation logic in place. It provides visual documentation,
 making it easy for back-end implementation and client-side consumption.
This package is a dependency of aiohttp-swagger (see #892495). I have chosen to
package the 2.x branch of this package rather than the more recent 3.x branch
because this is the current version required by aiohttp-swagger, and there are
significant changes between the two versions.
Note: An RFP already exists for the 3.x branch. See #871461.
