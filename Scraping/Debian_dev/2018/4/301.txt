Read carefully.
I wrote "everyone is allowed / suggested to work on those packages", not
this is a blanco cheque to do anything you can think of. Collab-maint is
like a big team (with everyone being member) and such what is acceptable
or not should be like what's acceptable or not in our (bigger) teams.
Especially I did not endorse hijacking.
(And yes, I'd be ok if someone adds himeself as Co-Maintainer to my packages,
and brush them up and fixes this nasty bugs, fine with me;) I agree with you
that at minimum out of courtesy someone should get in touch before doing so.

If you were right, what exactly would be the difference between collab-maint
and the other personal repos, then? Because you have all those features you
describe in every repo.
As said, this is not an endorsment of any hi-jacking but this thread sheds also
some not so nice light on you... But Holger wrote that already.
