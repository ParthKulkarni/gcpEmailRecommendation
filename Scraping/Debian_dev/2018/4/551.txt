I love Tcl.  I am still writing lots of new Tcl.
But of course Tcl is not deprecated upstream.
Having said that, the question is how much work is it to keep having
python2.  Helmut gave an example of a situation where it _is_ work:
having python2 gets in the way of crossbuilding and porting.
I think that there comes a point where it is reasonable to ask people
who want to keep something going, in the absence of upstream support,
to do that kind of work.
Adrian: are you volunteering to write patches to solve Helmut's cross
building problem ?
Ian.
