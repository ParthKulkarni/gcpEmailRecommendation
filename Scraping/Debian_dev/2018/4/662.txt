  Description     : full-featured http proxy for Node.js
 This Node.js package provides an HTTP programmable proxying library that supports
 websockets. It is suitable for implementing components such as reverse proxies
 and load balancers.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This package is a dependency of shiny-server (which will be maintained by the
Debian-science group). As we assume that this package is of broader interest
for the Node.js community we'd like to see it maintained by someone who is more
into Node.js packaging than we are.
