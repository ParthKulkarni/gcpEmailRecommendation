My point is exactly about the difference between "We have to send a 
clear message on the right direction, which is Python 2 removal."
and "real world difficulties".
There are no real world difficulties with supporting the Python 2.7     
interpreter and most Pythin 2 modules in buster.
It is actually more relevant what is supportable by us than whether or 
not upstream still supports it.
Rarity of CVEs makes security support easy, while many security issues 
with fast-paced upstream development can be a security support nightmare 
(e.g. webkit).
There are of difficult cases like "upstream dropped Python 2 support",
these are a separate topic.

I don't think it would ever be a good idea to have companies competing
on that.
No matter whether it's the Debian release team for stable or Freexian
for LTS, you need one place where the decisions are made.

Such decisions are made by Freexian and their sponsors.

Unfortunately this would be the problem below the tip of the iceberg:
Python modules are not provided only for usage in other packages.
Users who are using our packaged python with the packaged modules
might suddenly lose modules they need.
