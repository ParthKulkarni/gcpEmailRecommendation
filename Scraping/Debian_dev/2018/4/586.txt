Unless I'm misunderstanding, I don't think you're correct.
To give a concrete example, Fedora switched to using Python 3
as the default several releases ago[1]; despite that, Python 2
is still available in the archive, and will get pulled in when
installing software that (regrettably) hasn't been ported yet.
The same is true for FreeBSD and, I believe, Ubuntu. I'm not
familiar with the approach other distributions and OS are
taking, but I would expect it to be fairly similar.
