Athos and I already apologized ourselves in your private email that you
sent us April 11th and we said that we could do a better approach and we
would revert that as you requested (even reintroducing a bug with it).
In short, we had a communication issue. Although, from April 11th to
April 15th (yesterday) I was helping in the organization of MiniDebConf
Curitiba and I did not have enough time to figure this out. Sorry for
the delay.
However, I am really upset since you are selling us as the "bad guys"
here, for instance adding our names in the subject was not a good
decision IMO. Moreover, Athos is a newcomer and he is feeling really sad
because of this attack in a public mailing list. He is a very skilled
developer and he was working on the migration of gjots2 to use gtk3
(related to the RC bug), I do not know if he will keep it up after your
email. So blame on me, not him.

Anyway,Â  Athos was writing some patches and he wanted to send them to
you for review. We will leave your package as it is and I wish you can
keep working on it.
Sorry for the miscommunication and this noise in debian-devel.
Regards.
