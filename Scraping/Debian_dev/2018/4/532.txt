you make it sound like the lintian maintainers are a bunch of lunatics,
but according to src:piuparts/debian/copyright, that's us, the piuparts
maintainers. the lintian maintainers (and uploaders) are a bunch of
(ex- and current) people from the release team, ftp team, policy editors
and others.
and, afaik, they react to bug reports. maybe for now this python2 warning
should be downgraded to 'info'? what would be the best way to tell them?
