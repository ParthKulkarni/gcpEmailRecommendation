  Description     : tools for searching collections of biological sequences
 The FASTA programs find regions of local or global similarity between
 Protein or DNA sequences, either by searching Protein or DNA databases,
 or by identifying local duplications within a sequence. Other
 programs provide information on the statistical significance of an
 alignment. Like BLAST, FASTA can be used to infer functional and
 evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify
 members of gene families.
 Packaging is team-maintained on salsa.d.o/med-team/fasta3.
