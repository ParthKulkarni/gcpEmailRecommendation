  Description     : Get a list of the files to add from a folder into
an npm package
 This uses the following rules:
 If a package.json file is found, and it has a files list, then ignore
 everything that isn't in files. Always include the readme, license, notice,
 changes, changelog, and history files, if they exist, and the package.json
 file itself.
 .
 If there's no package.json file (or it has no files list), and there is
 a .npmignore file, then ignore all the files in the .npmignore file.
 .
 If there's no package.json with a files list, and there's no .npmignore file,
 but there is a .gitignore file, then ignore all the files in the .gitignore
 file.
 .
 Everything in the root node_modules is ignored, unless it's a bundled
 dependency. If it IS a bundled dependency, and it's a symbolic link,
 then the target of the link is included, not the symlink itself.
 .
This Package is a dependency of npm.
Praveen has agreed to sponsor this package.
