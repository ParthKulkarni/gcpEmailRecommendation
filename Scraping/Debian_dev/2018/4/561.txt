LTS is a Debian project running on Debian infrastructure.  It's true
that most of the news you see about it is related to Freexian, but
there are other contributors quietly working on it.
But you are right that packages can be excluded from support - and in
fact this can be done during the regular stable period, at the
beginning of LTS, or later.  Specific exclusions are recorded in the
debian-security-support package.
