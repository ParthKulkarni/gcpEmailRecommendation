Hello,
some people inquired why I am not using salsa for hosting debian
packaging information in the "other" thread.  With alioth being
decomissioned I had to decide where to move.  Some of my upstreams and
co-maintainers are already doing their work in github.com, so it was a
natural choice.  Furthermore, I was a bit unhappy with the lack of
stable URI for the debian-hosted git services.  I think I started out on
alioth.debian.org, then moved to git.debian.org a year later, only to
receive lintian warnings yet a year later that I was not using the
canonical anonscm address (which I found longer than necessary) and now
finally, another year later alioth being decommissioned.  I don't like
having to move every year or so, even if the repos itself did usually
survive.  From what I see, I'd probably also need to create yet another
account on yet another cloud provider whereas I already have a github
account.  I have learned that some people are unhappy with the level of
"free" of github, but to me at this point it is just a tool.  I am not
"married" to the idea of hosting my packages at github, but that's what
it is going to be for now, hoping for a more stable experience there.  I
am in no way locked into github or else I would not have moved there.
Regards
Rolf
PS: The (frankly absurd) idea that collab-maint means "free-for-all" to
usurp and actually upload your packages behind your back had nothing to
do with it, BTW.  ;-)
