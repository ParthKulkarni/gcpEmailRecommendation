Given that "software collections" provides a containerized Python 3
build and basically none of the rest of the Python ecosystem
modules outside the stdlib (which would all require manual
rebuilding against it), this is nowhere close to the same as
providing an optional Python interpreter within the global system
context as Debian has done. At least the projects I work on don't
see RHEL software collections Python 3 as remotely supportable.
