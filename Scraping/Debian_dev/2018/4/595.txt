It just happen to be the case that the Python 2 package is named
"python", when really, it should have been called "python2".
Just like python-foo is the Python 2 module package for the "foo"
module, and probably it would have been better called "python2-foo".
That's probably unfortunate naming, but never the less, there's still no
such thing as the "default python interpreter" package in Debian, our
users still have to manually choose between 2 and 3.

No ! See above.
