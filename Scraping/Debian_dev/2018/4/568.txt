Since we are supporting Python2 in the next release, there is no value in dumping python-* packages now.  Unlike many areas of the archive, Python packages are actively used by third-party code that isn't and won't be in Debian.
I've personally invested time and political capital in external projects I've worked on to get people to use Debian packages as a stable base and not just download semi-random code from wherever.  Please don't make this harder.
I'm generally in favor of getting rid of old stuff, but python2 isn't there yet.  It's much newer and better maintained than things like Qt4 that are getting to the better part of a decade without upstream support.
Please wait until after Buster and then feel free to resume the charge.
