  Description     : Exhaustive exploration of Fascist theory and practice
Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by
dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of
industry and commerce, which came to prominence in early 20th-century
Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War
I before it spread to other European countries.
>  - why is this package useful/relevant?
I believe this is the development trend most of the world is currently
aiming for, and that, like with other recent questionable development
practices, Debian should at least acknowledge its existance, but not
embrace it. 
>  - is it a dependency for another package?
No. Historically, once fascism has been launched, there has been little
space for anything else.
>  - do you use it?
I do all I can to avoid it.
