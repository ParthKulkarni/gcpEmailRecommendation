As I say, this is neither interesting nor troublesome.

I don't agree, but that's just chopping semantics over "officially
provide".  That a colliding source version was not "officially
provided" (whatever that means) does not mean that it is good practice
to generate this kind of confusion.
You'll see the other thread on -devel at the moment where a package
was mistakely left languishing in NEW; one significant causal factor
in this mistake was IMO-inadvisable reuse of the version number.
