This has been addressed by policy now, does you recommendation still hold?
I understand the explanation for source and binary package, but I wonder if
I have the right interpretation for the upstream source code:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#uniqueness-of-version-numbers
  3.2.2. Uniqueness of version numbers
  ...
  Additionally, for non-native packages, the upstream version must not be
  reused for different upstream source code, so that for each source package
  name and upstream version number there exists exactly one original source
  archive contents (see Files).
Since the intial upload was as native package, and the latest as non-native,
this does not apply to moon-buggy and I can upload with revision 12 as you
suggested?
thanks,
Christian
