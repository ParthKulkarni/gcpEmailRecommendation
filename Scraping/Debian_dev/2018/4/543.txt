I think I agree.
I'm also struggling with how to rephrase this, though I'm thinking that
maybe the 2nd paragraph should simply go away, as overriding these lintian
warning at this point in time seems like the right thing to do.
(Which then in conclusion makes me think that this whole warning
shouldnt be a warning but rather a pedantic info right now, because this
will save affected maintainers from adding the override now and removing
it once Buster has been released.)
oh, and btw, piuparts has a python3 branch in git, I would be delighted
if someone could finish it ;)
