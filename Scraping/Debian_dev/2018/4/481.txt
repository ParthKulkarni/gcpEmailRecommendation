Note that the Policy says:
If the maintainerâ€™s name contains a full stop then the whole field will
not work directly as an email address due to a misfeature in the syntax
specified in RFC822; a program using this field as an address must check
for this and correct the problem if necessary (for example by putting the
name in round brackets and moving it to the end, and bringing the email
address forward).
