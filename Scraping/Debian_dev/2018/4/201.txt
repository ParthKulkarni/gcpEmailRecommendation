This is an interesting legal theory, and I would be interested to hear
whether any free software lawyer agrees with it.  (And the distinction
they try to draw is so unclear that I really doubt a court would want
to rule on it.)

I think we should determine that either:
1. This provision is not enforceable, and we don't need to do that.
2. This provision is enforceable, it is a restriction on use, and it
   makes nmap non-free.
