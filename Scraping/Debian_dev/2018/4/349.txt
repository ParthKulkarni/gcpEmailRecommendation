To what end?  Are we then going to vote on whether Rolf's decision to defer
the new upstream releases was technically sound, before we will recognize as
valid his feelings of frustration that Debian's norms and policies were not
followed?  Is our response to a complaint that a maintainer's rights[*] have
not been respected, to further punish the maintainer by collectively
usurping that position for ourselves?
Now, I don't think this thread should ever have been begun the way it was on
debian-devel.  There are appropriate ways to provide feedback to the DAM and
the NM team that don't involve publicly naming and shaming people on
Debian's highest-profile technical mailing list; and the general problem
could be discussed here without needing to name anyone.  But by my
reckoning, that means we should be trying to get our noses out rather than
sticking them further in.
