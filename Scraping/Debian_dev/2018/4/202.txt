Personally I think under English law such things, when distributed
with nmap, would be part of a work as a `whole' (within the meaning of
the antepenultimate para in GPL s2) and would have to be distributed
under the GPL2 even if nmap was under the vanilla GPL2.
Absent the explicit statement to the contrary later in the licence,
these provisions therefore add nothing and the resulting licence would
be GPL2-compatible.
I appreciate that this is not a very popular view.

The provision is certainly not a restriction on use.  It's a
restriction on the licences of software which is intimately designed
to work with nmap, and accompany it, and is best seen as extensions or
embeddings of nmap.  It's only a restriction on distribution; users
can do what they want.
I haven't looked at the packages above but many of them seem
specifically to be libraries for using nmap, or ways of embedding
nmap.  The fact that the licence is not, on its face, compatible with
nmap's, is probably a mistake.  We should ask the upstreams to "for
clarity" dual-licence their code under (i) their existing licence
(ii) the nmap licence.  And we need to check the rdepends.
