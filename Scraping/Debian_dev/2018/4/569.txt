+100 to this. Even at a previous life in a fast-moving startup, I
convinced the rest of engineering that "if you want to use it, and it
isn't in Debian, you get to package it first".
(aside, also had the advantage of convincing people to use more
commonly-used packages, rather than some random fork of a fork they
found one dayâ€¦)
