I thought this is called "salvage" now?
There might have been some miscommunications, but given an acceptable
alternative is just requesting the removal of a package with open RC
bugs that hasn't been uploaded for a time, isn't just salvaging the
package by adding oneself as a maintainer better?
And if this is the preferred outcome, shouldn't the salvaging be
"easier" than just requesting removal (which is just one bug report
away)?
