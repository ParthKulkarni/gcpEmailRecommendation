  Programming Lang: GNU R
  Description     : GNU R abstractions for promise-based asynchronous programming
 Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous programming
 in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful for allowing a single
 R process to orchestrate multiple tasks in the background while also attending
 to something else. Semantics are similar to 'JavaScript' promises, but with a
 syntax that is idiomatic R.
Remark: This package is needed to upgrade r-cran-httpuv to the latest
upstream version.  It also depenends from the just packaged r-cran-later
so this needs to be accepted first in new queue by ftpmaster.  The
packaging will be maintained by thr r-pkg team at
    https://salsa.debian.org/r-pkg-team/r-cran-promises
