Hi debian-team,
I just plan to contribute the debian project and care about the
orphaned package storebackup, which I use at home and work during the
last maybe ten years.
While exploring
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=856299, 
I noticed, that 
Vcs-Git: git://git.debian.org/git/collab-maint/shutter.git is given,
and I wonder why there's a reference to the shutter-project. 
Is this a mistake by one of the old maintainers and needs to be
corrected or did I miss something in the DM-docs?
Best regards
