  Description     : REST2 API extension (Request Tracker)
 This extension adds a modern REST API to Request Tracker.
The existing API for RT is a rather painful RFC822 (yes email) based
system via HTTP. This extension provides a much nicer JSON based RESTful
interface.
The intial packaging work has been carried but by myself for my employer.
Ongoing maintenance will be by the Debian Request Tracker Group (of which
I'm a member).
