Python 3.3, the first release people could reasonably start migrating
to, is from 2012. Before that, it was very difficult to have a codebase
compatible with Python 2 and Python 3. Debian Wheezy didn't have
it. Python 3.4 was released with Debian Jessie (3 years ago). So, people
didn't have 10 years to migrate.
