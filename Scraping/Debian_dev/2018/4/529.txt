A lintian warning is even a reason for REJECT. "I" (my mentor) uploaded a new source package "zodbpickle" 5 weeks ago and I wonder if it's stuck because of this. I found strange to put an override for this so I didn't.
The ITP contains a link to an email where I explain why it is needed:
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=842870
(to sum up: required dependency in order to package a new version of ZODB with support for Python 3)
But I don't want to drop the Python 2 module of ZODB. That's what I only use for the moment.
(Actually, I read all the recent discussions about NEW closely: it's quite frustrating that all the work for #783377 was roughly done 2 years ago, and after difficulties at getting sponsored, I may now be blocked by this warning.)
