It's a source of confusion (and confusing side-effects) that, once added,
can never be removed, however many upstream releases might happen.

Sort of. It appears in the form of the version number that's in most
places, but not in canonical filenames. Conceptually, it's part of the
Debian package version but not part of the upstream version.

A recap of what happened, for those who might have lost track:

The newest version of the old tar-in-tar packaging can be seen here:
https://sources.debian.org/src/moon-buggy/1.0.51-11/
What I would personally have done *then*, from that starting point, would
be to bump the version to 1.0.51+repack, or maybe 1.0.51+upstream if
the new orig tarball was something that the upstream developer released,
or something similar, then package and upload revision 1 of that. That
would have been fine - no epoch needed.
However, because you previously maintained this as a native package,
there has been no collision for the filename of the orig.tar.gz, because
before the epoch was added there *was* no orig.tar.gz; and you've already
paid the maintenance cost of having an epoch, so you might as well benefit
from it. So what I'd advise *now* would be to increase the revision to 12
and carry on from there.
