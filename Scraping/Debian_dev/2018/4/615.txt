  Description     : Distributed version control system based on a sound theory of patches
Pijul is a free and open source (GPL2) distributed version control system.
Its distinctive feature is to be based on a sound theory of patches, which
in particular provides new ways of dealing with merges; it tries to make
it easier to learn and use, and truly distributed.
Since April 2017, Pijul is self-hosted, in the sense that it is used for
its own development.
