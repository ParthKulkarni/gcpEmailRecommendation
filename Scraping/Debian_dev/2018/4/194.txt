Makes sense.

Where does gconf depend on these?

Good point, I haven't yet looked at these.

Yes.

There have been 2 port bringups already this year so far (ia64, riscv64),
and a bigger amount of contributors' time and attention is actually 
wasted for these in cases like #876592 or #887868 where the maintainer
didn't apply a simple FTBFS fix for months.

The worst-possible outcome is when you force reverse dependencies to 
bundle copies of the libraries, like glademm in aeskulap.

I will begin to take your suggestion seriously after you have managed
to enforce that for ITPs - whatever quality expectations we have should
be enforced there already, usually software does not suddenly become
low-quality after it was shipped in half a dozen Debian releases.
