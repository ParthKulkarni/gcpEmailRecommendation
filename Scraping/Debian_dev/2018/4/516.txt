  Description     : Odoo's Community Association Version of Odoo
Odoo is a suite of open-source enterprise management applications. Odoo is
used by large companies, small businesses, associations and many different
types of organizations to help them manage, automate, measure and optimize
their operations, finances and projects.
The Odoo Community Association, or OCA, is a nonprofit organization whose
mission is to promote the widespread use of Odoo and to support the
collaborative development of Odoo features.
The Association provides financial, organizational and legal support to
the broader Odoo Open Source community. It also serves as an independent
legal entity to which community members can contribute to the code,
funding and other resources with the knowledge that their contributions
will be maintained for public benefit.
As part of their mission, they are maintaining a fork of Odoo on
https://github.com/OCA/OCB that we want to bring into Debian. Later
we will want to package more modules maintained by OCA.
