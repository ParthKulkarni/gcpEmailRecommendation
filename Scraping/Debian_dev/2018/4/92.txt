Assuming your "skip 10 versions and use one changelog stanza"

I've had cases where the only thing I criticized in a sponsorship 
request was "this change is not mentioned in the changelog".
What I got was an updated package with an added line in the changelog,
and that was perfectly fine.
As sponsor, being nitpicky about good packaging becomes less desirable 
if this would result in skipped versions in the uploaded package.

Imagine tomorrow a random person from the internet noone has ever heard 
of uploads a package dgit 5.0 to mentors.d.n.
It is clear that this would not be sponsored.
"detected by tooling" would mean that this would result in dak 
autorejecting any future uploads of a dgit package version 5.0
to Debian.
