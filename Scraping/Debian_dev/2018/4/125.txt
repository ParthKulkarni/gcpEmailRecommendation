You would already have to add some extra information since the Policy text
was ambiguous.  Different people interpreted it differently; for instance,
whether it downloaded the *current* orig.tar.gz file or the one for the
next upstream release.

I don't think agree that this is something Debian *needs*, and I
personally don't really agree with your sponsorship rule and wouldn't
apply that rule myself.  (You're of course free to apply any restrictions
you want to what packages you're willing to sponsor.)  I can see how it's
very *useful* to automate a common operation like updating to a new
version of upstream, but I wouldn't make it a requirement, and I also
don't think this fairly unusual edge case requires standardization.
That said, I think guidance for good practices for edge cases is always
useful if someone wants to write it up, and the Developer's Reference
seems like a good place to accumulate such things.
