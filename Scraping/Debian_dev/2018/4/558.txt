Some package maintainers do not wish to spend the time and effort
necessary to support python 2 indefinitely in their packages. That's a
reasonable personal assessment, and I applaud package maintainers for
saying so early, clearly, and publicly.
The question is what (if anything) do any of us want to do to provide
resources to provide that support.
We do not have unlimited maintainer time; triaging is sad, but it
produces better outcomes.
