Since he's been told it was fair game to hijack the package because he'd used collab-maintenance, I guess I can hardly blame him for wanting to avoid that risk.
It's easy enough to create a personal git repository on salsa, so it's there's no need to go to GitHub, but not everyone knows that yet.
Personally, I think people should be more annoyed at the people doing the hijacking than the one they did it to.
