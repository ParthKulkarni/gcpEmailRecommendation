I thought it was worth mentioning that the behavior of 'openssl rehash'
when encountering a duplicate certificate was to return 1 while
'c_rehash' would return 0. I say was because I filed an upstream bug[1]
about it which was resolved.
This difference in behavior resulted in the following Debian and Ubuntu
bug reports.

We've gone ahead and patched openssl in Ubuntu for the 18.04 release but
it would be good to get openssl updated in Debian.
