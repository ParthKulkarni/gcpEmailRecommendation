Debian version numbers are usually not globally unique.
The binary packages of dgit 4.3 in Debian and Ubuntu are different 
builds from the same sources, and for binary-any packages such
different builds usually have different contents.[1]
And more common is actually the reverse problem of someone publishing
a different 5.0 after a 5.0 is already in our archive (usually by
making modifications without changing the version number).

Giving every person on the internet the power to steal version numbers
for random packages would be dangerous.
There's implicit meaining behind version numbers, like debhelper 12
being the first version where compat 12 will be stable.
Apart from obvious (scripted) DoS for taking all reasonable numbers for 
a package, it would also e.g. encourage derivates to steal Debian 
version numbers instead of using a proper namespace.[2]
Versions of packages that are accepted into our archive must be unique, 
but random people from the internet should not have the power to 
restrict what a maintainer can do in Debian.

[1] e.g. different Debian revisions of gcc usually generate slightly
    different code
[2] e.g. using 1.0-2 instead of 1.0-1devuan, resulting in an
    improved dak autorejecting a maintainer upload of 1.0-2
