I think so as well, I just haven't had any tuit (and, more importantly,
much motivation) to spend time on it.
IIRC gpg is used only to do signature checking, that doesn't reaquite
the full gpg at all, but isn't the relevant bit named 'gpgv'?
But that's not the point, there is code trying to do parse the output of
gpg (iirc, the regular output, not the --with-column one), so it's not
really a matter of gpgme/gpgv/gpg/gpg-agent stuff.

Yes.  Please open a bug (or a MR) to further discuss it, debian-devel is
very much not the place for it.
And maybe hop by #debexpo on oftc.
