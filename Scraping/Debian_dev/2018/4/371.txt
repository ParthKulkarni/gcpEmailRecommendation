Packages maintained by forensics-devel@ and pkg-security-team@ all
have a fixed maintainer email in git. I was not planning on doing any mass
upload right now and I would be really annoyed to have to hand-edit all
changelog entries to add a bug closure.
So please don't file bugs for those. However a new check and/or a ping a
few months before the freeze would certainly be welcome.
Cheers,
