That's true and will likely remain so.  Personally, I expect both the package name python and the usr/bin/python symlink will be retired when python2.7 is removed.
Even after Debian removes python2.7, we expect local usage to remain for the foreseeable future and it would not be doing our users any favors to pollute the python2 namespace with python3.
