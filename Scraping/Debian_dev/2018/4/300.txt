Tobi, I never knew I could simply self-appoint myself to maintainer with
a simple (sponsored) upload of libpng16 (a package you co-maintain) or
tokyocabinet (a package you maintain), drop you to uploader or nothing
and you'd be cool with that.Â  Hey, it's in collab-maint after all, isn't
it?Â  Awesome!
Joking aside, I think you are the one who misunderstands
co-maintainership and collab-maint, not me.Â  I welcome patches,
pull-requests for git branches, co-maintainership, etc.Â  It's sad if you
can't see the difference to what happened here.
