I would suggest we exclude NMUs from "No uploads for > 365 days" requirement.
The person who want to salvage the package probably should also wait for two 
weeks after initial public contact, then send another public email, wait for 
another two weeks, send another public notification email before doing actual 
salvaging efforts (moving packaging repo, uploading packages, etc). Idea
