if that's possible, fine.  otoh, I would be fine to have a very reduced set of
python2 apps in buster+1, if that's needed.  Sure we can remove mercurial and
OpenStack if they are not ready for Python3, but I'd like to avoid that.  It
doesn't mean that we should any old, upstream unmaintained Python2 dependent
package.
