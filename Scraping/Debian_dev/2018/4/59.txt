  Description     : utility to control media players via MPRIS
Playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling media players
that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification. Compatible players
include vlc, quod libet, audacious and spotify.
Playerctl makes it easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause,
to media keys. Playerctl also provides an introspectable library accessible
in many popular scripting languages that allows more detailed control like
the ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata such as
artist and title for the playing track.
