That's very informative.
It's also rather worrying.  It does not seem to provide an answer for
users who like and have grown used to the existing arrangements, and
the behaviour of their existing panel widgets.
The motive for this change seems to have been to increase the
behavioural uniformity of things in panels, but given that the plan
involves changing every applet to use a new library, that could have
been done without a change of protocol.
I guess the MATE panel will continue to offer xembed support ?
