At what stage should Python IDEs uploaded to NEW disable or not
install Python 2 support?  Now?
Should Python 2-specific IDEs and/or Python 2-specific educational
materials be removed from the archive?  If so, then when?
Andreas, I've CCed you because we've been in touch in the past, and
because I have friends who do graduate work in bioinformatics on
Debian systems.  With the upcoming end of Python 2 in Debian, what can
we do to avoid losing them to CentOS?  Also, if appropriate and if it
wouldn't be too much work, does Debian have a role in encouraging
new masters and PhD candidates to choose Python 3?
Sincerely,
Nicholas
