  Description     : Puppet module for Ceph
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module manages both the installation and configuration of the Ceph
 distributed storage system.
This is part of puppet-openstack which I'm currently trying to package and use.
