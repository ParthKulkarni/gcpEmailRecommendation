  Description     : FIX_ME write the Debian package description
 Node.js module that provides a transform stream capable of peeking
 the first line (or the first 65535 bytes if no newline is found) of 
 a stream before actuallt processing it, so that the consumer can
 decide how to parse it.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This module is required to package gunzip-maybe, see ITP:
https://bugs.debian.org/897019
That is required for node-yarnpkg, see ITP:
https://bugs.debian.org/843021
and wiki:
https://salsa.debian.org/js-team/node-yarnpkg/wikis/home
My intention is to maintain it within the JavaScript maintainers team.
The repo will be on salsa:
