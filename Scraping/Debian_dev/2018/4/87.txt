  Description     : magit-popup is an emacs interface to set option to call emacs-command or even shell-command
This package implements a generic interface for toggling switches
and setting options and then invoking an Emacs command which does
something with these arguments.  The prototypical use is for the
command to call an external process, passing on the arguments as
command line arguments.  But this is only one of many possible
uses (though the one this library is optimized for).
The binary package was part of the magit source itself, but as been
split outside of it as the upstream author believe it will be useful
for others Emacs package. It is now a dependency of magit, (and
elpa-magit is still its only reverse dependency in Debian, even if some
package that depend on elpa-magit also need it).
