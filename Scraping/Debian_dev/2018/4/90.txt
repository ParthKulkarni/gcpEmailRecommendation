As a strict policy this would create more problems than it solves.
A version is published to our users when it gets accepted into
the archive.
Readable information in apt-listchanges is IMHO more important
than theoretical discussions around whether something submitted
to mentors.d.n is public.
A changelog is also permanent, and people might read it decades later 
for understanding packaging decisions - already today it is not uncommon 
to check 20 year old changelog entries for that.
For either of the above a weird version history or 10 Debian revisions 
until a new maintainer got her first packaging attempt correct are
not optimal.
Or a more funny issue:
How would you notice a version reuse in all cases?
A package uploaded to mentors.d.n. adopting a package with
"New maintainer" as only change is usually a reject. If some DD does
the same years later, there is no record anywhere that this version
was already taken by some random person from the internet who once
upon a time uploaded it to mentors.d.n.
