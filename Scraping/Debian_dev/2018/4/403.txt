Actually there are some nice developments like http://www.apollo-accelerators.com/ to increase the speed of m68k for quite a few bugs.

Yes, I think this is the main problem since m68k has been kicked out as a release arch. This whole second class architecture is a mistake, IMHO. Another approach would have been better, like focussing on being release-ready only for base and other essential packages, but not the whole archive. 
This effectively killed m68k in the long run. Other archs followed then.

Thatâ€™s maybe the only positive thing that evolved in the aftermaths of kicking out m68k: a parallel infrastructure was developped that could act without all those complicated formalisms of official buildds (at least in the early days). 
But I think this could have been achieved without kicking archs out of Debian. 
I think especially m68k did a great job in teaching many DDs how to deal with autobuilders and such. Buildd & co were built, because of m68k and Debian. The very first buildd was running on kullervo.

Iâ€™m still not a big fan of emulated buildds. ;-) 
But I have to admit that they are way faster than the old, real hardware.

Well, the last info from buildd.net database:

At least crest, akire and elgar might be still online, maybe kullervo as well, but Christian can comment on this, while spice, arrakis & vivaldi are currently offline as in powered off or has a NIC that is currently not supported by Linux (spice).
Iâ€™m not totally opposed in powering on one or two machines again, but itâ€™s a matter of time and investment as well: administrating those machines is time consuming and keeping them running is expensive in terms of paying the power bill here in Germany. Thatâ€™s the reason why I have powered off the machines some time ago as I didnâ€™t feel honored of donating these resources to the Debian project anymore, because of exactly those comments like â€žI donâ€™t care about your silly pet architecture! Get outta my way and donâ€™t evenm dare to write bug reports as I will ignore them!"

As stated above: 
there *is* new powerful hardware with FPGA-based accelerators for cheap Amigas like A500/A2000, A600 and A1200. There are reports that the Vampire accel runs at a speed of a 200 MHz 68060 or even more. 
But currently I have no working Amiga with Debian running as a porterbox at the moment. As said, I would be willing to offer a machine if there is a general interest of having a porterbox running.

Fun fact: Iâ€™ve lately bought an Acard ARS2000SUP for Spice and put a 500 GB 2.5â€œ SATA drive into it. It was the smallest drive I could find at my default hardware dealer. Thatâ€™s giving me enough space for installing Debian *and* NetBSD in parallel with hundreds of GB each! And still lots of space for AmigaOS. ;)
Anyway, itâ€™s a matter of money to have enough disk space available. The old SCSI/SCA disks are at an age where they die a slow, yet certain death.

I have full respect for Adrians work. The same respect I have had for your contribution to m68k for several years!

Well, running a machine is one part. I might help with that. The porting stuff would then be your part. ;)
As already mentioned in a different mail: there is a m68k meeting planned in September in Essen (Linuxhotel). :)
