You're making an argument against a strawman.  You don't think there's 
anything different from making a change in git and making an upload to the 
archive where you demote the previous maintainer from maintainer to uploader 
and set yourself as maintainer of the package with no prior communication?  
That's what happened here.  I'd be upset too.
