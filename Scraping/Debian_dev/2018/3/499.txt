I've tried this approach for the case when a package needs (for various
reasons) an ISA extension above the baseline, and it didn't go well.
Another trouble is that, as it's said, because DAK relies on stable's dpkg
you can't have a package even declaring a relation on an architecture that's
not know to stable's dpkg.  This would make porting tedious.
