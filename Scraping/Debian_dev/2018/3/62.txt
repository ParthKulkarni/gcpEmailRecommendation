Steve Robbins dijo [Sat, Mar 03, 2018 at 01:15:35PM -0600]: (...) To me, one of the puzzling aspects is why the FTP policy work has been so  secretive.  The release team has a mailing list, tech committee has a mailing  list.  There is Debian Policy list.  It doesn't seem in congruence that the  ftp team is making their policy behind closed doors.  Should it not flow from  Debian Policy and be debated on open lists?  Or maybe it is all open and I simply haven't found it.  If so, I would  gratefully accept pointers.  Concretely: where would one find the  deliberations behind https://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html ?Ummm...Not that I know much about how ftp-masters work internally. But I havebeen on several other Debian teams. In general, all decisions aretaken in the public - But it is by far not uncommon to resort toprivate communication for many of the non-obvious, contentiouscases. There are *always* cases where you want to discuss somethingwithout the affected actors being part of the loop.Yes, Debian as a whole strives for openness, and you will often seecalls to "get out of private" whenever interesting discussions takingplace. But I would perfectly understand and support a ftp-masterworkflow that routinely involves private communication - Theirdecisions, although non-personal in nature, can be *felt* as personalattacks.
