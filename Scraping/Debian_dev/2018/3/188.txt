I always understand that what Adam states here is some consensus and I
follow the same policy to not have any gaps in version history (for
exactly the reasons Adam has given).

Disclaimer: I do not sponsor from mentors.d.n but I require my sponsees
to use an apropriate team Vcs and the tag will be only set if the
package has hit unstable.  I also set tags for my own packages only
after beeing accepted in unstable.
