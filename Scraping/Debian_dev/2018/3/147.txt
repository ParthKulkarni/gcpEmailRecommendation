It's almost spring in northern Europe and with the lengthening day I
start getting many crazy ideas. Here's one: it would be truly awesome
if we could review each source package at least once per Debian
release cycle. I don't think that's possible, it would be awesome if
it were.
There is, in unstable, about 28000 source packages right now, if I'm
counting correctly. A release cycle is about two years. That's about
40 source packages per day, every day. That would require either a
very large number of extra volunteer reviewers, or automation.
If most upstreams were systemtically tagging (perhaps using SPDX)
their sources with licence information, or we had a mostly reliable
tool for deducing that information automatically, this might be
feasible.
