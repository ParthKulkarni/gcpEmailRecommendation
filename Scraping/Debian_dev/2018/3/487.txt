In my interpretation 3) means:  I need help and I'm actively seeking for
it by asking upstream, on debian-mentors, debian-ports, my parents ;-)
etc.  As I previously said I will also keep on watching this bug whether
some help might have been arrived in the bug log since I might have
missed something in the incoming channels.
In contrast to this in case 2) I will not check again a bug tagged
wontfix+help and I will not become active myself to seek for help.
