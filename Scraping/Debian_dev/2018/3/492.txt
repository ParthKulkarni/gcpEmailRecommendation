When looking at FTBFS on the buildds common patterns are e.g.:
- FTBFS on big endian
- FTBFS on 32bit
- FTBFS on architectures where char is unsigned
I would not see the benefits of tagging 8 ports when the pattern of 
red/green makes it clear that the problem is due to char being unsigned.
There are special cases like config.{guess,sub} on brand-new archs,
but otherwise it is very rare that a package fails on exactly one 
architecture only.
