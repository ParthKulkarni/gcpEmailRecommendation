 WARNING: This SDK is **NOT yet official**. What does this mean?
  * There is no formal Dropbox support for this SDK at this point
  * Bugs may or may not get fixed
  * Not all SDK features may be implemented and implemented features
    may be buggy or incorrect
 .
 However:
  * The SDK, while unofficial, _is_ usable.
  * Dropbox would like to get feedback from the community and evaluate
    the level of interest/enthusiasm before investing into official

This package is needed as dependency for the new upstream version of rclone.

Tobias
