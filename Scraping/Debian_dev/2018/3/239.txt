  Description     : siphashc is a python c-module for siphash, based on floodberry's version
SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (a.k.a. keyed hash
functions) optimized for speed on short messages. 
siphashc is a python c-module for siphash, based on floodberry's
version.
This is a dependency for Weblate (http://weblate.org):

I have asked upstream why they chose siphashc over alternatives, and the
answer was: "It was third party package where I later took over the
maintainership, that's why it's separate. I was looking at other
alternatives as well, but the problem is that the only maintained
alternative which exposes siphash is python-nacl and that performs way
worse due to working as generic hash and producing strings instead of 64
bit integers which we need. Overall it was quite big performance drop in
my tests."
The plan is to maintain it inside the Debian Python Modules Team.
Everyone is welcome to help. :-)
