I share your assumption that if we try to get a real random set of
packages checked instead of checking those who are ending up by random
reasons in new we will end up with less re-checked packages.  However,
this does not give any good reason for keeping the habit to re-check
packages where a resulting binary package is not inside the package
pool.  It somehow reminds me to those people who were asked: "Why are
you doing this?" and gave the answer: "Since we did so all the time."
We all know that ftpmasters have a lot of work and this thread is about
convincing ftpmaster to stop some work that does not belong to their
initial task which is *checking new source packages*.  So far I've read
a single example in this thread that a developer was happy about the
check since a mistake was avoided.  But this would have happened by a
random user via BTS as well.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
