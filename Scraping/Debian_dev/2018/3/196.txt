That is, IIUC, by design and for good reason.
Before a review of the copyright status of the work is done, we don't
have confidence the Debian Project has permission to redistribute it
publicly.
If it turns out the work is not redistributable by the Debian Project,
it is then too late; and the case could be made that we should not allow
that situation to arise (i.e. we should not redistribute before we have
confidence the work can legally be permitted by us).
So, putting it up on some public Debian infrastructure before it passes
review is, IIUC, problematic for that reason at least.
