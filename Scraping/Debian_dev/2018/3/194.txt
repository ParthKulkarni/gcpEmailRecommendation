If someone comes up with a patch to process-new which does this in a
halfway reliable way, it doesn't need a long time wasting thread on
devel to get it.

And that is thankfully something everyone can just do (ask your peers
for review). And is something that got proposed tons of times. Never see
anything come from it.

No its not, its up to the ones that want it to patch dak process-new.
That is, parsing the bug-close list (if any), finding out if thats
really an ITP, and if so, CC it on rejection/prod.
Note that this has to be automatic, if it requires us to enter anything,
it is doomed to fail.
