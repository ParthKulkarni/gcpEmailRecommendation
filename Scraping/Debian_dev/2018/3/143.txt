Let's not try to be wiser than ftpmasters: if, despite the increased
workload, they haven't expressed such an obvious wish yet, they obviously
value sanity checks here.
What might be reasonable is making the separation between binNEW and srcNEW
more obvious, especially for us on the other side.  This would also
encourage the ftpmasters to skip license checks for binNEW -- but again,
without knowing their workflow I'm not in a position to improve it.
Meow!
