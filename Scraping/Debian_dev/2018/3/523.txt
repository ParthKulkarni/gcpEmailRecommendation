... which is what we normally do if something is more frequent than once
per year / month / week (depending on your personal threshold ;-) )

Basically never ever build on any 32 bit architecture.

Bcftools should be buildable on i386 *in* *principle* but as you noticed
it fails and it is known (bug #819617, #870060) and discussed with
upstream[1].  Unfortunately upstream support for non-amd64 architectures
is weak and one resolution for the said bugs is to exclude i386 (and
other 32 bit architectures).  However, we did not gave up hope, thought.

No.  Bwa and bowtie2 were explicitly designed for amd64 (not even 64 bit
in general since it contains assembly code).  These packages are
   Architecture: amd64 kfreebsd-amd64
So getting bcftools tests fixed would be nice but has no influence on
paleomix testing migration.

When we are now talking about this:  The excuses page could mention the
prefered way of action.  I checked the link to the britney docs[2] bit I
did not found any clue.  As I said I went that road about two years ago
with metaphlan2 but I simply tend to forget things I'm doing only once a
year - thus my mail.  If an automatic procedure seems to make more
effort than manual processing or might change a running system to deeply
its perfectly fine for me.  Some kind hint what to do would probably
avoid this kind of questions here.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
