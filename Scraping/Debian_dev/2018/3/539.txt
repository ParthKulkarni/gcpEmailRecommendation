  Description     : SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)
The SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) provides the API for
creating and building SOAP messages. The SAAJ API conforms to the
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 1.1 and 1.2 specifications, and
the SOAP with Attachments specification.
The SAAJ API defines the javax.xml.soap package which was integrated
to the JRE since Java 6 and was eventually removed in Java 11.
This package is required for the transition to Java 11 and will be
maintained by the Java Team.
