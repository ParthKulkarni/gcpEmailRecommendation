I did not report any of those issues as I am aware of some QEMU bugs
that can occur from time to time. QEMU bugs still deserve to be fixed.

How is it a fake bug if the bug was actually in QEMU? Also, again, I
did not report any of those bugs and I wouldn't have reported them
as I usually start looking at QEMU myself first.

I have worked as a physicist myself for a long time and also did numerical
physics and have dealt with a lot of software written by scientists. The
quality of scientific software is usually of exceptional low quality
because 90% of those scientists are neither programmers nor do they
care of adhering to any common quality standards when developing
software.
Furthermore, from my own experience, most people compile scientific
software from source anyway due to performance reasons, especially
when it comes to using them for large calculations. So I don't see
a point for having to package all of that in Debian.

Honestly, what kind of response did you expect when your first suggestion
to address these issues is to completely destroy the work of others? Do
you actually think this is acceptable? You weren't asking for a compromise
or a constructive discussion, you right away wanted to use the most
radical solution and now you tell me that I am aggressive. Great.
