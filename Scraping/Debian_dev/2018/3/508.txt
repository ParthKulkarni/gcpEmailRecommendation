Hello debian-devel and mentors,
Recently I found a disagreement with my mentor about proper handling of 
library transition (bumping SONAME) and we agreed that we need some 
suggestions.
Transition documentation (written by Release Team) can be found at [1].
Some quick facts:
* We have a libdframeworkdbus1 with soname 1; it is a standard Multi-Arch 
library:
    % dpkg -L libdframeworkdbus1 
    /. 
    /usr 
    /usr/lib 
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu 
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdframeworkdbus.so.1.0.0 
    /usr/share 
    /usr/share/doc 
    /usr/share/doc/libdframeworkdbus1 
    /usr/share/doc/libdframeworkdbus1/changelog.Debian.gz 
    /usr/share/doc/libdframeworkdbus1/changelog.gz 
    /usr/share/doc/libdframeworkdbus1/copyright 
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdframeworkdbus.so.1 
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdframeworkdbus.so.1.0 
    /usr/share/doc/libdframeworkdbus1/CHANGELOG.md.gz
* Upstream released new version and bumped SONAME to 2
* -dev package didn't change its name
* My mentor suggests that the new library package (libdframeworkdbus2) should 
add the relationship "Conflicts: libdframeworkdbus1"
...and such necessity is not reflected in the documentation. My personal 
thought is that with "smooth updates" (as described in [1]), the old library 
and the new library (with different SONAME) should be able to installed 
simultaneously on any Debian Unstable / Debian Testing system without any 
problem during the transition. If that is true, the "Conflicts:" relationship 
shouldn't appear. The "Replaces:" relationship [2] should not appear as well 
because there won't be any file conflcts.
We'd like to know that with transitions for library soname bump, is 
"Conflicts:" relationship needed / not needed in all circumstances and what 
problem might users / developers encounter if it is added / not added.
Thank you very much.
