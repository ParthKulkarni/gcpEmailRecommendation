Yeah, but my point is that, except those cases, current consensus seems to
be that there should be no separate changelog entries, no versions and no
tags.
(I say "seems" because there was no formal vote or formal thread, but when a
sponsoree produces such a changelog, no one among usual sponsors ever said
anything to the contrary.)

Alas, same applies to most of conventions.  It would be good to have such
things documented rather than learned by osmosis, but describing processes
is something no one volunteers for.

Ten is a quite extreme case, but 3-4 are common.  (Obviously most uploads
get in on the first go.)

That's what we have RFS bugs.  Every publicly reviewed upload has a
permanent trail.  The majority of uploads go this way.
There's no requirement to ask for review publicly, but private channels also
allow adequate communication with the reviewer.  Heck, as someone who
sponsors ~10√ó as many uploads as I do myself, I tend to use the same routine
I do for sponsoring for my own uploads.  In this case, the communication is
entirely within my brain!
And, the summary is not what's being checked.  I for one tend to skim over
RFS mails with so little attention I sometimes miss remarks from the
sponsoree -- looking only at debian/changelog.  This is what I read
carefully, comparing what's written there with what's in debdiff vs the last
version in the archive.
Comparing debdiffs is the main manual part of review.  And why would I care
that the shed got repainted red then blue, if it was black the last time it
was in the archive and is pink now?  This kind of details is ok for untagged
commits in git, but neither the reviewer nor the end user are interested in
changes that have been superseded between tags/uploads.  The process that
led you to decide on pink might be interesting but it's not what is being
reviewed.
The less _irrelevant_ information, the less work for us.  If the talk is
archived on the RFS bug, there's no information loss either.

Gaps can be useful, but most of the time they're unintentional, that's why
there's a need for a comment.

Uhm, that's reserved for NMUs.
