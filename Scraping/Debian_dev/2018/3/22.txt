In particular, getting rid of the idea of maintaining a clean patch
queue separated into individual commits.  Instead, use "git merge".
If one wants to examine the diff between the vdeb source and upstream,
one runs
  git diff upstream -- ':!debian'
(I have some tools near completion that would make it easier to
maintain a separated-into-individual-changes patch queue entirely in
git, but I think your project will have small deltas and want to go
for simplicity, at least at first.  You want to optimise for the case
of a small, nor absent, delta.)
