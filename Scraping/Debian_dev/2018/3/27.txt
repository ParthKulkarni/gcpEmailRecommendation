You omitted "security support", which is essential for any real-world usage.

More seriously, our priority should be to help users getting working
and security-supported systems.
Distribution-agnostic formats like flatpak might become a good option
when people always want/need the latest upstream version.
An ancient version with known vulnerabilities and no security support
in stable is clearly worse than whatever the management tools of the
upstream ecosystem would install.
The first question should always be if/how we can provide something that 
is better than what is already available elsewhere.
The worst case would be if we have to tell more frequently to users
"Please don't use the packages in our stable release." because they
are worse than alternatives.
