The last time Easy GnuPG has been discussed on the GnuPG mailing list:
thread starting around this message
https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2016-April/055835.html
and later
https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2016-May/056007.html
Easy GnuPG was not deemed ready for end users, and technical issues with
the code were identified.  I think including it in Debian is akin to
recommend it and somehow a statement on its technical cryptographic
validity.
It seemed that people on the GnuPG mailing list were not too
enthusiastic about reviewing it.  Has something changed since then?  Is
there an (informal) evaluation of the code or of the project in general
from a third party?
Cheers,
