the new 68080 CPU core might be powerful enough to build on real
hardware again:

If needbe, I'm willing to invest in and operate build hardware.
But still, hardware that is too weak to build packages does not mean
that the hardware is to weak to *run* the resulting software. A couple
of MIPS based platforms are also too weak to build packages on, but
Debian *runs* there just fine. Some build toolchains are quite bloated
these days.
Greetings
