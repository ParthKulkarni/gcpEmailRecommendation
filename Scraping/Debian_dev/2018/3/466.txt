Just to not make that mistake again:  Is it the
  "I'm wondering when it might be time to fully drop a hardware
   port instead of draining developer time for ethernity"
in my mail you stumbled upon.  May be its the language barrier but I do
not think that if a random developer is wondering about something this
is equivalent to "asking for the ultima ratio".  I was honestly thinking
about whether we are keeping alive an architecture by everybody using
emulators.  I try to be more careful in my wording in the future when
asking questions about ports (and hope I will manage).
Kind regards and sorry again if I tipped on somebodies shoes
      Andreas.
