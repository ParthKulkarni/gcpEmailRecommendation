with my sponsoring hat on, I will be unhappy if someone reuses version
numbers and I will ask to never do this again. I very much agree with
Ian's position that this is bad.
As a sponsor, I'm a non-negligible user and I want to sensible be able
to not having to again review stuff I already have reviewed.
If you have put it on mentors.d.n, it's out in the public.
