  Description     : A C++11 RAII wrapper for XCB
XPP is a header only C++11 RAII wrapper around X protocol C-language Binding
(XCB).
Since there is another package named "xpp" in Debian, I am going to use
"libxpp" as the source package name.
Note that I am packaging a fork of xpp. The original repository hasn't been
updated in 4 years, the features that polybar requires were added in the fork.
This package is a dependency of polybar (ITP #856179)
