  Description     : module to make an object aware of process forks and threads
Object::ForkAware invisibly wraps your object and makes it fork-aware,
automatically checking $$ on every access and recreating the object if the
process id changes. (The object is also thread-aware; if the thread id
changes, the object is recreated in the same manner.)
The object can be safely used with type checks and various type constraint
mechanisms, as isa() and can() respond as if they were being called against
the contained object itself.
Rationale: If you've ever had an object representing a network connection to
some server, or something else containing a socket, a filehandle, etc, and
used it in a program that forks, and then forgot to close and reopen your
socket/handle etc. in the new process, you'll know what chaos can ensue.
Depending on the type of connection, you can have multiple processes trying
to write to the same resource at once, or simultaneous reads getting each
other's data, dogs and cats living together... It's horrible, and it's an
easy problem to run into.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
