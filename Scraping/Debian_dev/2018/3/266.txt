  Description     : GNU R easier cluster computing (based on snow)
 Usability wrapper around snow for easier development of
 parallel R programs. This package offers e.g. extended error
 checks, and additional functions. All functions work in
 sequential mode, too, if no cluster is present or wished.
 Package is also designed as connector to the cluster management
 tool sfCluster, but can also used without it.
Remark: This package is needed in BioLinux and thus a sensible target for
the Debian Med team.  The actual packaging will be done by the r-pkg team
at
