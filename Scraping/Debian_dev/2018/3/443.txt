Description     : library for inserting developer icons in Emacs
 This package is a utility for using and formatting various icon
 fonts within Emacs.  Icon Fonts allow you to propertize and format
 icons the same way you would normal text.  This enables things such
 as better scaling of and anti aliasing of the icons.
 .
 This package was inspired by the following projects:
 .
 - `mode-icons' for Emacs, found at https://github.com/ryuslash/mode-icons
 - `file-icons' for Atom, found at https://atom.io/packages/file-icons
 .
 Currently, this package provides an interface to the following icon fonts
 .
 - Atom File Icons
 - FontAwesome Icons
 - GitHub Octicons
 - Material Design Icons
 - Weather Icons
 - AllTheIcons - Custom font with fewest icons
This package is needed by emacs-neotree, which is needed for the spacemacs packaging effort.
I plan to maintain the elisp parts as part of the Debian Emacsen
Packaging Team, but it will be necessary to coordinate with the Debian
Fonts Task Force for the "icon fonts".  I will need a sponsor for the
initial upload.
Sincerely,
Nicholas
