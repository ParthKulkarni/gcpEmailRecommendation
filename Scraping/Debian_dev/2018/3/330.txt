You always build against the version that is currently inside Debian and
that version is determined at the point of upload (respective for a
given architecture when the build deamon starts building the package).
Unluckily I used the same syntax for a constraint in Build-Depends as I
was using for the fact I tried to describe better now.
 
Hope this clarifies the issue
