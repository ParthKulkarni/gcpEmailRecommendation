  Description     : Library of C routines to read and write problems from the Friction Contact Library
fclib is an open source collection of Frictional Contact (FC) problems
stored in a specific HDF5 format, and an open source light
implementation of Input/Output functions in C Language to read and
write problems.
The goal of this work is to set up a collection of 2D and 3D
Frictional Contact (FC) problems in order to set up a list of
benchmarks; provide a standard framework for testing available and new
algorithms; and share common formulations of problems in order to
exchange data.
Fclib is an open-source scientific software primarily targeted at
modeling and simulating nonsmooth dynamical systems
Package notes: fclib is an optional dependency of Siconos, a nonsmooth
dynamical systems simulator.  I plan to maintain it but propose it for
consideration with the Debian Science team.  It is a very minimal
codebase with only libhdf5 and suitesparse as dependencies, and is not
expected to change very often, with the exception of likely adding a
higher-level layer in the future (e.g., a Python interface).
