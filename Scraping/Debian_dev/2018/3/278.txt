Hello
Since a lot of people are going to migrate their package repo from alioth to 
salsa, I've created a small script for cme to help update debian/control file 
for this new package repository.
Once you have updated your repo to the new remote (can be on salsa or anywhere 
else), run
 cme run set-vcs-git
This command will update Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git in debian/control (from the 
url of the "origin" remote) and commit the change.
The remote name can also be specified. For instance:
 cme run set-vcs-git -arg remote=debian
For help, please run:
 cme run set-vcs-git --doc
or
  cme run --help
This new script is available from libconfig-model-dpkg-perl 2.106 (and 
requires cme package)
All the best
