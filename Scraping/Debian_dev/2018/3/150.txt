Speaking as someone who has taken over a package, been negligent in
ensuring debian/copyright was up to date and hit NEW as the result of a
soname update I am grateful for the time that the FTP team (Chris, as it
happens) invested to do a quick sanity check and tell me I was an idiot.
As a result I discovered licensecheck and have become much better
(though I doubt perfect) at ensuring such things stay up to date.
If we had enough spare people power then I've no doubt a concerted sweep
across the archive would find lots of packages that could do with some
TLC, whether copyrights or elsewhere, but realistically that's just not
going to happen.
