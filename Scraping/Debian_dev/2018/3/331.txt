Hi,
I am experimenting with the salsa.debian.org issue tracker, to see if it can
help with the maintainer job: project management, tracking maintainership
priorities, kanban board.
Of course the BTS is and remains the sole authoritative database: this is a
duplicate, "internal" list.
So I have written an experimental python script to keep the salsa issue
tracker aligned with the debian BTS.
More info here: https://salsa.debian.org/paolog-guest/bts2salsa
Please note the status: alpha release, incomplete, buggy.
Paolo
