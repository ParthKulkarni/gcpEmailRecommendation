  Description     : Puppet module for Joshuabaird IPAclient
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module configures clients to use FreeIPA with as little fuss as possible.
 This module used to be known as stbenjam/puppet-ipaclient, but is now being
 maintained at joshuabaird/puppet-ipaclient.
