The core problem is that in the control file the permitted syntax for 
the Architecture: filed is much more restricticted than the permitted 
syntax for (build) dependencies.
Dependency fields have negative syntax like !m68k, for the Architecture: 
field this is only possible with a complete list of all architectures
except the one you want to exclude.
