  Description     : fast, efficiently stored Trie for Python
 Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with
 O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as hashing,
 trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
 manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
 spelling dictionaries.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2/3 interface to libdatrie.
Remark: This package is needed to upgrade the package snakemake which
 is maintained by the Debian Med team (thus the non-medical datrie also
 remains in the team).  I tried hard to replace the code copy of
 libdatrie-dev by the Debian packaged code but failed.  Even if I would
 have succeeded libdatrie-dev would need to add a patch.  The attempt
 is documented in the DEP3 header of the deactivated patch.
