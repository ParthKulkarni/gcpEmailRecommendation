  Description     : User Agent Parser core - collection of regular expressions
  A collection of regular expressions for parsing web User Agents strings.
  
  This package does not include a parser, only the data necessary to
  build one.
  
  The regular expressions are stored in a YAML file that is usable by
  implementations in any programming language.
  
Upstream has User Agent strings parsers in many languages, they all
depend on list of regular expressions in this file. I'm currently
packaging the Python version of the parser (python-ua-parser).
The last upstream release was in 2015. There are many changes since
then. I'm packaging the latest version of the upstream master branch.
