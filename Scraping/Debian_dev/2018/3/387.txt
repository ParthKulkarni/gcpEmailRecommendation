  Description     : implementation of a few basic data structures
Inspired by .NET's Linq, querying data structures used in this library
is a snap! Build Go pipelines quickly and easily which will apply
lambdas as they query your data structures. Converting between slices
and a queryable structure is as trivial as it should be.
This package is a dependency of the new upstream version of
golang-github-azure-azure-sdk-for-go.
Regards,
Tobias
