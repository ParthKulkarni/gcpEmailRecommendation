Certainly in the exceptions you list, a separate changelog entry is a
good idea.
I don't see where this policy you are implementing is written down.
It doesn't seem to exist in policy or even the dev ref.

How many replaced attempts are we typically talking about ?
When an attempt is replaced, the reviewer would no doubt like not only
the whole new package, but a human-readable summary of what the
submitter has intentionally changed.  How do you think that
human-readable summary ought to be communicated to the reviewer ?
I disagree that gaps in the version numbering require an explanation,
but even if they do then that is not a problem.
(Of course that the Debian revision does not need to be a single
integer.  If you want to distinguish various attempts from the
accepted submissions one could write -1.1 or something.)
Ian.
