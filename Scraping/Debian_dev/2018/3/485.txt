The documentation of wontfix[1] currently allows for both
interpretations, and I think both are OK, especially if that helps
maintainers filter out bugs that aren't ever going to be fixed.
I think that the use of wontfix+help can disambiguate between the two
interpretations.
For example:
1) wontfix: This bug isn't going to be fixed; don't bother helping.
2) wontfix+help: this bug requires too much effort to fix, so I won't be
   working on it, but patches will be accepted.
3) help: I want to fix this bug, but I'm blocking on assistance from
   someone
But that's not documented at all.
Would a sentence: "Use the help tag in addition to the wontfix tag if
you would still accept a patch that fixed this issue." to the wontfix
description be useful?

I've had so much good luck recently I was getting sated with it. It's
like sugar, good luck. At first it's very sweet, but after a while you
start to think: any more of this and I shall be sick.
