There is a reason why I wrote "reviewes" in my proposal, and not "ftp-
master": this kind of tracking could be an incentive for more people to
get involved reviewing other peoples packages, because it gives a clear
path for contribution, and adding to it what I wrote as answer to
Samuel, there is also the possibility for recognition of this review
work by adding an "Reviewed-By:" entry to the changelog.
Apart from that, I would guess is that the ftp team already does some
tracking.
