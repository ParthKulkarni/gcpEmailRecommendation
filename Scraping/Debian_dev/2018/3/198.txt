This argument doesn't pass laugh test.
There's plenty of places where anyone -- not a DD, not a DM -- can
distribute arbitrary files using Debian infrastructure.  Beside the obvious
(Alioth, Salsa), there's the BTS.  Mailing list archives.  Wiki.  Etc, etc.
On the other hand, to upload to NEW, you need to be a full DD.  Ie, the file
being _temporarily_ distributed passed judgement of someone who passed a
lengthy process that includes copyright training.  Not even a DM is
considered good enough.  Such a person may still make a mistake but it'd
be something minor (you can look at REJECTs you got yourself).  And then,
NEW is a temporary staging area where files get removed after review.
Meow!
