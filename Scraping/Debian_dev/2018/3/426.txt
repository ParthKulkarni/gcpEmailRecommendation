  Description     : in-memory key:value store/cache (similar to Memcached)
 go-cache is an in-memory key:value store/cache similar
 to memcached that is suitable for applications running on a single
 machine. Its major advantage is that, being essentially a thread-safe
 map[string]interface{} with expiration times, it doesn't need to serialize
 or transmit its contents over the network.
This package is a dependency of the new upstream version of rclone.
Regards,
Tobias
