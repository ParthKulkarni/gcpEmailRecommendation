I also interpret wontfix as "patches will not be accepted; the current
behavior will stand."

I would also interpret the help tag as "yes, this should be fixed, but I
would appreciate some assistance with it."
It might be helpful to have a new tag (perhaps "ignored"?) that means
that the maintainer believes that the effort to fix this bug would not
provide enough benefit to the overall user base of the package to
warrant spending the time to fix, but if someone who did care provided a
clean, easy-to-review-and-apply patch, it would be applied as time
allows.
