  Description     : Transit Relay server for Magic-Wormhole
This repository implements the Magic-Wormhole "Transit Relay", a
server that helps clients establish bulk-data transit connections even
when both are behind NAT boxes. Each side makes a TCP connection to
this server and presents a handshake. Two connections with identical
handshakes are glued together, allowing them to pretend they have a
direct connection.
This server used to be included in the magic-wormhole repository, but
was split out into a separate repo to aid deployment and development.

will be in collab-maint, new dependency for wormhole.
