IME there are two (more) aspects when dealing with wontfix bugs: keeping
those bugs open, so they are more visible or closing them. I've come to
prefer closing them and trying to document them in README.Debian or some
such.
IMO both aspects are valid and it's a matter of taste.
(Similarily (to closing and documenting wontfix bugs) at the end of
piuparts.git/TODO there is list of closed wishlist bugs which I closed
not because the feature is unwanted, but because noone is working on them,
so they are just cluttering the BTS view... 
see http://blog.liw.fi/posts/wishlist-bugs for a longer rationale.)
