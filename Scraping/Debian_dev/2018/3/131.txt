For this, we have the BTS. If the issue is RC, it will prevent shit from
migrating. Salsa's issue tracker doesn't have this feature.
Also, I would really have preferred if Salsa's issue tracker feature was
simply removed/desactivated, because every other day, there's someone
proposing to replace debbug with it. Thanks but no thanks. One place is
enough to look into. If you wish to write somewhere, the ITP bug is the
correct place to go.

I've sent so many packages through NEW that I sometimes feel guilty
about it. Though I don't know how to make it easy for them.

Let's reject the Linux kernel, Qemu, etc.: they are too big... :)
More seriously: big software are more complex, but probably also more
useful for our users. So your proposal doesn't feel right.

P.S: Why on earth do we need to have the ftpmaster@d.o as Cc? Don't you
guys believe they read debian-devel without cc-ing them?
