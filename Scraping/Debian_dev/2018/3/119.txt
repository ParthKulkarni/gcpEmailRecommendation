(I guess you forgot <sarcasm-off> </sarcasm-off> brackets around your
statement :-P )
I'm happy that you confirm my assumption that picking from the new queue
is orthogonal to the person who uploaded the package.
To Steffen: How demotivating would it be for a newcomer if a package
needs to wait for a long time for the only reason that this maintainer
ID is showing up the first time in the new queue?
Kind regards
    Andreas.
