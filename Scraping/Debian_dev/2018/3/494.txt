Back when I was maintaining OpenAFS, I frequently wanted some way as a
maintainer to easily tag a package as "this will never for the forseeable
future be supported on this architecture" and move on.  We don't have a
great mechanism for doing this right now -- there's a thing on the buildds
that's pretty opaque and that I don't know how to set as a maintainer, and
one can list a bunch of specific architectures on the package but that's
really awkward and interacts poorly with arch: all packages.
The chances of anyone really wanting to run some of this scientific
software on m68k seem remote, so it feels like it would be an overall
reduction of friction if the maintainer could just say "I don't support
this arch" and the porters could stop looking at those packages (unless
for some reason they disagree with the maintainer and think users of that
arch are really interested).
