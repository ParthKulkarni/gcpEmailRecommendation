Mostly out of wanting to (eventually) start small.  It just reduces the 
problem surface.  Arch:all packages can virtually be built anywhere, on any 
architecture, so vdebs wouldn't (really) need a buildd network; or at least 
not a multiple-architectures' buildd network.
At first glance, it would also seem to vastly facilitate reproducibility, and 
reduces potential for executables' injection.
In pretty much the same vein as dh-virtualenv, a possibility would be to do 
install-time build, through triggers for example.
