  Description     : Java API for XML-Based Web Services (JAX-WS)
The Java API for XML-Based Web Services (JAX-WS) provides the API
specification for creating web services, particularly SOAP services.
The JAX-WS API defines the javax.xml.ws.* packages which were integrated
to the JRE since Java 6 and were eventually removed in Java 11.
This package is required for the transition to Java 11 and will be
maintained by the Java Team.
