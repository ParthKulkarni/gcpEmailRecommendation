I'm afraid you have a rather narrower view of the FTP Master role than the project [1], in particular, "... oversee and maintain the well-being of Debian's official package repositories ...".  The specifics listed later in the delegation message are examples, not an all inclusive list.
Checks during binary New are very much part of that task.  I know most people who aren't part of the team mostly interact with the FTP Team because of Source New, but in many respects it's one of the least important things the team does to keep the archive healthy.
