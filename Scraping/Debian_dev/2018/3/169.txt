The only option I see for doing this in the BTS would be to ask the ftp
team to file the reject messages as a new bug against the source
package. I refrained from proposing this because this would mean filing
a bug against a package version that is not yet available in Debian. 
Since the re-upload to NEW would have the same version like the version
the bug is filed against, the BTS might get a hiccup. For that reason I
originally proposed doing this with the salsa issue tracker.
Apart from that it is my experience that packages that do not introduce
new source packages usually pass NEW a lot faster, and are less prone
to errors that result in a reject by the FTP team.

Specifically targeted at the new SO-version case, Steve Robbins
proposed to reword the policy that *only* uploads that introduce new
SOURCE packages go through NEW. 
I have to admid though, that I'm not sure whether this should apply to
all library packages. For instance another big package I co-maintain,
insighttoolkit4, introduces a new SO version at least every year, but
which each such version bump upstream also adds many files that may
have varying copyright that require an update of d/copyright. Giving
packages like this a free pass might not be such a good idea.
Best,
Gert
