  Description     : GitHub enhanced version of cmark, the common markdown
parser
Common Markdown provides a useful standardized language for building formatted
documents. The 'cmark' parser, already in Debian, provides a basic parser
implementing the core Common Markdown standard. People involved in the GitHub
system have forked 'cmark' in a way which leaves the core language unchanged
but extends the system to add table and other additional formatting methods.
This extended version of Common Markdown is used within the github system for
formatting .md files in project repositories and, as such, is becoming widely
used within that environment.
I've got preliminary packaging working here:
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/keithp/cmark-gfm.git/
I'm packaging this so I can use it to replace asciidoc in the altos package as
asciidoc is being deprecated.
