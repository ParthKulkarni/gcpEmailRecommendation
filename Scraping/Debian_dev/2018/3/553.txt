  Description     : FastCGI engine using IO::Async
Net::Async::FastCGI allows a program to respond asynchronously to FastCGI
requests, as part of a program based on IO::Async. An object in this class
represents a single FastCGI responder that the webserver is configured to
communicate with. It can handle multiple outstanding requests at a time,
responding to each as data is provided by the program. Individual outstanding
requests that have been started but not yet finished, are represented by
instances of Net::Async::FastCGI::Request.
