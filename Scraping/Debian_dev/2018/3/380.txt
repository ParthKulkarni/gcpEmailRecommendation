  Description     : wallabag commandline client
Wallabako is a Wallabag (read-it later service) client for Kobo
readers. It downloads unread articles as individual EPUB files.
Features:
 * fast: downloads only files that have changed, in parallel
 * unattended: runs in the background, when the wifi is turned on,
   only requires you to tap the fake USB connection screen for the
   Kobo to rescan its database
 * status synchronization: read books are marked as read in the
   Wallabag instance
--
This can serve as a backup/synchronization tool for your Wallabag
instance, although it is currently restricted only to ePUB versions.
