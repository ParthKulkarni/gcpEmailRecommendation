Honestly, I don't know.

I see your point.

When I use the help tag I usually do this together with asking for help
say on debian-mentors, upstream or elsewhere.  I do not hope that some
help just comes from simply setting the tag.  I also look into bug
reports that I've tagged help from time to time whether some help might
have arrived which I could have missed for some reason.
I confirm that with your interpretation of wontfix it would be misuse if
I would set it in the said case.  I checked the doc[1] and while the
beginning of the explanation would fit your interpretation it leaves
some kind of "open door" for me in the end: "... or possibly for other
reasons."
I do not want to base my arguing on this last phrase.  I was just
seeking some practical means to also keep my team mates away who might
become attracted by a "help" tag.  The three bugs in question that
triggered my initial mail kept at least two developers of R packaging
team busy and I would love to have some means to prevent this.  In case
we decide that wontfix is not the right answer for this problem (and I
agree with your reasoning) we could possibly invent some "porters" tag
or something like this which would probably be the best solution for
this problem.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
