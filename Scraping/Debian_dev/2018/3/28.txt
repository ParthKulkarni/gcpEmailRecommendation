An answer to that question might often be: "because it integrates
into a Debian system". -- This is also an answer to the proposal
raised here some days ago about not being shy to promote third-party
repositories; no objections from me in general, just the remark that
most third-party .debs I've seen are of abysmal quality. So even if
we can't provide a true real-debian all-DFSG-free
non-embedded-code-copies etc. package in main, I think offering a
.deb (or .vdeb or flatpak or whatever) in the spirit of contrib/non-free
aka DFSG#5 would be a valuable service to users, as we can offer
packagees that Just Workâ„¢ (as in: don't install files into absurd
locations, don't require crazy manual update steps with scripts
placed SomeWhere etc.)

We might need an archive area which is independent of our release
suites. I guess there's lots of software out there which doesn't
align with our release cycle, fixes bugs only in "latest release"
etc. -- but still works from anything between oldstable and
unstable. While this is all a bit disgusting from our traditional
Debian point of view, users would still be better of with installing
a package from, say, "alien&weird", that works on a Debian system
over having to fight with creative upstream packaging attempts or
manual installations&updates.
Cheers,
