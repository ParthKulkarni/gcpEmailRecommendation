I have an orthogonal proposal to enhance efficiency: stop re-examining each 
new SOVERSION of a shared library package.
The NEW queue is said to be for "when a new package is uploaded to Debian for 
the first time" [1].  For many packages, uploading a new upstream version goes 
straight into unstable.  This is not true, however, for shared library 
packages.  Because of the convention that a shared library package name 
contains the SOVERSION and the convention that any new binary package requires 
going through NEW -- each and every new upstream makes a trip through NEW.  
This is unnecessary work for FTP masters and unnecessary friction.
Solution: change the convention to "any new SOURCE package requires a trip 
through NEW".
