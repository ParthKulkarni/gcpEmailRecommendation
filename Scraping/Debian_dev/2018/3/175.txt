The most common counterpoint to bumping the version is that it's harder
to get right because for some reason our tools rely on the whole delta
to be present in the .changes file rather than inferring it from the
in-package changelog. So bug closure information gets lost unless you're
careful in how you build the package, which makes it more likely to get
wrong.
Kind regards
