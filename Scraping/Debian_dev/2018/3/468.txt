I read your the part you quote above as a rhetorical question[1], and
I also found it very aggressive.
I don't think that there is a way to "ask the question" about whether
someone's work should be destroyed which would not be perceived as
very hostile and aggressive.
I would recommend completely avoiding questions like "should we drop
port X" unless you actually mean that you think the port should be
dropped.  Since that is the way everyone will read it.
Thanks,
