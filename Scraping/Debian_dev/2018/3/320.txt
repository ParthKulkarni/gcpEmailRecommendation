Policy requires 3.  Yes, it creates another package, but the ability to
install two versions of a shared library at the same time is vital to how
we do upgrades and is more important than avoiding the occassional extra
package.
The other option is to version the configuration file so that each SONAME
of the library uses a separate config file, but usually that's worse for
the user and it's better to just have a separate config package.
