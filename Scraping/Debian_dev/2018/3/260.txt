I assume you're talking about make-guile:
apt rdepends make-guile
    Crickets.
build-rdeps --old make-guile
    Nada.
The other package that is deep within build chains, graphviz, produces
binary: libgv-guile:
apt rdepends libgv-guile
    Zilch.
build-rdeps --old libgv-guile
    Nothing.
So having these useless bindings complicates bootstrap and transitions,
while giving no apparent benefit.
Meow!
