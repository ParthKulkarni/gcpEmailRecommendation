Besides of what I wrote below, even if the package in question would
not be in a public accessable place, handling the comments of such a
review in a public discussion (or BTS) should be not a problem.

As far as I can see, salsa.d.o is open to the public, and so is
mentors.d.n, both places where people would typically prepare or upload
 packages also before passing NEW for the first time. In the case of
mentors they actually have to upload their packages there.
So if there was an intention like this, it is not handled well. 
Best,
