As best I can tell, any project created in the Debian group
<URL:https://salsa.debian.org/debian/> already has the Issues permission
off, without anything else needing to be done.
That seems entirely appropriate, for a Debian packaging project, for the
reason you state (any Debian package should have bugs reported to the
Debian BTS).
Does that meet the preference you expressed above?
