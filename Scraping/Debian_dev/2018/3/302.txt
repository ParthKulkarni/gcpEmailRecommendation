Right.
Ultimately, in Debian the maintianer of a package decides what to do to
that package.  If a maintainer refuse to land a change you are asking,
and you fail to "sell" your change, that it: that change won't be
applied, period.

As Chris noted, one of the (informal?) jobs of the DPL is to facilitate
mediation.
TBH, I don't think here you need any kind of mediation, it's clear the
maintainer doesn't like your proposal.
I recommend you just find a way to live with it (and I don't think
doing no-change merges in ubuntu to workaround this issue are something
too hard to doâ€¦)
To that goeal I just uploaded src:moon-buggy 1:1.0.51-1ubuntu1 to
bionic: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/moon-buggy/1:1.0.51-1ubuntu1
it should appear in MoM just fine, and it hardly brings any relevant
extra work to the MOTUsâ€¦ (if you are seeking to lower the delta between
debian and ubuntu, there are bigger fishes to fryâ€¦).
