  Description     : flexible engine for running FCGI-based applications
FCGI::Engine helps manage FCGI based web applications by providing a wrapper
which handles most of the low-level FCGI details for you. It can run FCGI
programs as simple scripts or as full standalone socket based servers who are
managed by FCGI::Engine::ProcManager.
