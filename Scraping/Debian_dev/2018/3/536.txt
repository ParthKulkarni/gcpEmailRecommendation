  Description     : lightweight web browser based on Qt WebEngine
 Falkon is a new and very fast Qt Webengine browser. It aims to be a
 lightweight web browser available through all major platforms.
 .
 Falkon has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It
 includes bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above
 that, you can manage RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads
 with a builtin AdBlock plugin, block Flash content with Click2Flash
 and edit the local CA Certificates database with an SSL Manager.
----
Falkon is definitely the successor of the package qupzilla, which
is now obsolete, and will no longer be maintained. Falkon is now part
of KDE development works. I used to maintain the package for Qupzilla,
and will keep on maintaining the new-branded package.
This package closes bugs which are open for Clonezilla.
