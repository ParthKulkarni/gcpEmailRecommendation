At some point Jude DaShiell Cc'ed -devel. This accounts for some of the
traffic in this thread. I am also Cc'ing -devel. You didn't, but I am
not trimming any of your post; nor am I replying to every portion in
it.

The word "deliberately" was picked up and labelled as giving the message
an unfortunate tone and then linked with "deliberately breaking stuff".
A deliberate action need not be done with malice and there was nothing
in what I said which put ill-intent forward as a reason.

Trent W. Buck said in #694068:

As can be seen from
 
 https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2012/09/msg00282.html
having mode 0600 for /e/n/i was not given as a reason.
Futher on in the thread is:
 https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2012/09/msg00313.html

Nothing about mode 0600 as a reason for the design and there was a
willingness to change the default.
You said earlier:

That is touched on in the same -boot thread.
