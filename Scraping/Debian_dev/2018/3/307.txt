  Description     : Python implementation of the Binary Structured Data Format
Long-Description:
 The Binary Structured Data Format (BSDF) is an open specification for
 serializing (scientific) data, for the purpose of storage and (inter
 process) communication.
 .
 It's designed to be a simple format, making it easy to implement in
 many programming languages. However, the format allows implementations
 to support powerful mechanics such as lazy loading of binary data, and
 streamed reading/writing.
 .
 BSDF is a binary format; by giving up on human readability, BSDF can be
 simple, compact and fast. See the full specification, or how it
 compares to other formats.
This library is a new dependency for src:python-imageio. It will be
maintained by the Debian Science Team.
