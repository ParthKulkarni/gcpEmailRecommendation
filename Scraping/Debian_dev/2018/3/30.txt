I wasn't thinking of third-party .debs or anything else that
is Debian specific.
npm or flatpak would be examples that I had in mind.

"Debian specific flatpak" would be wrong, a flatpak app
is supposed to work equally well on all distributions.

"install files into absurd locations" doesn't even matter for solutions 
like flatpat that containerize an app separated from the system and 
other apps.
Regarding "as we can offer packagees that Just Workâ„¢", I do not 
necessarily see us providing better packages than upstream here.

Why would a Debian package from alien&weird be better than "npm install"?
Why would a Debian package from alien&weird be better than a flatpak
from alien&weird?
And it is hard to see the point why alien&weird should provide a Debian
packages when providing a flatpak would make the software built once
work equally well on all releases of all distributions, also avoiding 
all the pesky differences like different versions of the same library
having slightly different behaviour.
And for our users, a Debian package where the postinst from alien&weird 
runs as root and the proprietary software from alien&weird does not run 
containerized is not a good option.
