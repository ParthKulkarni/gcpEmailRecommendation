"Unfortunately, this means that libv8-3.14, nodejs, and the associated 
 node-* package ecosystem should not currently be used with untrusted 
 content, such as unsanitized data from the Internet."
IMHO any package in Debian stable that uses a node* package on untrusted 
content should get an RC bug and a CVE - it is clearly documented that 
this should not be done.
