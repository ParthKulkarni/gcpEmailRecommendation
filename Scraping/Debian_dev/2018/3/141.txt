Here's a thought:
How about documenting the reason for the change in the "changelog".  It can be 
frustrating reviewing a package with a new binary and zero information is 
provided about why it's there.
We already have debian/changelog that's designed explicitly for this kind of 
information, if only more maintainers would actually use it.
This has the added advantage of making the information available to system 
administrators who would like to understand why they have a new package on 
upgrade.
