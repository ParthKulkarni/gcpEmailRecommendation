  Description     : implementation of Montgomery and Edwards elliptic curve cryptography
 The libdecaf library is for elliptic curve research and practical application.
 It currently supports Ed448-Goldilocks and Curve25519.
 The goals of this library are:
  * Implementing the X25519, X448 key exchange protocols (RFC 7748).
  * Implementing the Ed25519 and EdDSA-Ed448 signature schemes (RFC 8032).
  * Providing a platform for research and development of advanced cryptographic
    schemes using twisted Edwards curves.
 This library is intended for developers who have experience with
 cryptography.
 libdecaf is a dependency for sphinx (a password Store that Perfectly Hides from
 Itself (No Xaggeration)).
 I plan to maintain it within the Debian/ namespace on Salsa. I do not require a
 sponsor.
