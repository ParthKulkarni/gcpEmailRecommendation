Because we don't know if a package is even distributable until after it's 
reviewed, packages in New are not available outside the FTP Team to review.  I 
don't expect that to change.
When an issue is noted or a question raised in a package review, we have a 
standard mechanism for prodding the uploader (person who prepared the change) 
via email.  For the case of a package that's been a long time in New with now 
feedback, the best way to find out the status is to ask in #debian-ftp.  There 
isn't always someone available to answer immediately, but questions to 
generally get answered.
