Ah, good to know.  However, this still means that you have to explode
"any" into a list of every architecture Debian supports except one or two,
and then every time someone wants to port Debian to a new architecture,
they have to ask you to change your package (my prior experience is that
the package would work on new architectures more often than not, since
they were often variations of existing supported architectures, like
64-bit versions of things that already worked with 32 bits).
So unless I'm missing something this still seems less than ideal....
