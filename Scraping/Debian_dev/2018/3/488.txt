I dislike the use of "help" in this context.  If the maintainers think
the bug is not worth their *own* time, it seems perverse for the
maintainers to set a tag which suggests to other contributors that
they should spend *their* time on it.
In general I think it's obscure to treat the tag power set as a matrix
and define special meanings for combinations.
