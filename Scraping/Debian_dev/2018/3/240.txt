  Description     : A Python library that provides an easy way to identify devices like mobile phones, tablets and their capabilities by parsing (browser) user agent strings.
user_agents is a Python library that provides an easy way to
identify/detect devices like mobile phones, tablets and their
capabilities by parsing (browser/HTTP) user agent strings. The goal is
to reliably detect whether:
- User agent is a mobile, tablet or PC based device
- User agent has touch capabilities (has touch screen)
user_agents relies on ua-parser <https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser>_ to
do the actual parsing of the raw user agent string.
This is a dependency for Weblate (https://weblate.org/):

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=796777
The idea is to maintain it inside the Debian Python Modules Team.
Everyone is welcome to help. :)
