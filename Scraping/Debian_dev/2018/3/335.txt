  Description     : Self-hostable web productivity suite & webapp package manager
Sandstorm is a package manager and sandbox meant for people to easily install
and self-host web applications, such as collaborative documents, blog systems,
project management tools, ...
Sandstorm provides a unified access control model to documents, based on object
capabilities, and secures against vulnerable or malicious applications by
executing each instance separately, and in a sandbox with extremely limited
attack surface.
As a side-note, one of the sandstorm upstream developpers, Asheesh (in
X-Debbugs-CC), is also a Debian developper, and the Debian community already has
a Sandstorm instance hosted at storm.debian.net.
Best,
  nicoo
