Yes it is.  But it is nice to have this generic standardized
mechanism we can build upon.  Setting it results in reproducible
behaviour (timestamp, random output, machine-, user-, hostname is
replaced).  It was the missing link to create a good test
environment.

Like i have said in the other mail, yes and no.  I will add
uname(2), but keep uname(1), too.  Better that is.
Ciao!
