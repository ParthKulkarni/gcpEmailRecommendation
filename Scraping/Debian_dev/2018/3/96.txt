Hello,
This reminds me a discussion at debconf: it could be useful that anybody
be able to submit issues with the NEW package, so that for obvious
things ftpmaster doesn't even have to spend time, and ideally ftpmaster
would only look at packages which have already been reviewed not only by
the uploader.
