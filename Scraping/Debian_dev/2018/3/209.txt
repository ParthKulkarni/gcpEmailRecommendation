  Description     : Bayesian Inference of Alignment and Phylogeny
 BAli-Phy estimates multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees
 from unaligned DNA, amino acid, or codon sequences.  BAli-Phy uses MCMC
 to estimate evolutionary trees, positive selection, and branch lengths
 while averaging over alternative alignments. BAli-Phy can display
 alignment ambiguity graphically in an alignment uncertainty (AU) plot.
 .
 BAli-Phy can also estimate phylogenies from a fixed alignment (like MrBayes
 and BEAST) using substitution models like GTR+gamma.  BAli-Phy automatically
 estimates relative rates for each gene.
- Why is this package relevant?
This package performs Bayesian inference of alignment, as well as inference of phylogeny like mrbayes, beast-mcmc, beast2-mcmc, etc.  This package produces higher quality alignments than programs like fsa, mafft, muscle, at the cost of taking much longer to run.
- How do you plan to maintain it?
I hope to maintain it myself.  I am looking for a mentor.
