I see no point in your repeated "to be honest" and blame others about
low quality.  If in doubt read these three bug logs:
   #882555, #887680, #887682
All say
   this failure turned out to stem from a problem with the build
   setup (specifically, a qemu bug); sorry for the noise.
Getting fake bugs of severity important due to the fact that no real
hardware is used since it is to weak is not really convincing for
maintainers to spent time on it.
Besides the fact that you went totally off topic with blaming scientific
software about its quality:  Yes, there is some share of low quality
software in science as in every other field.  We are working hard to get
it fixed.  If there are real bugs in the code these will occure not only
on m68k but also on other less used architectures and we try to sort
this out with upstream.
Your mail was quite convincing to me to simply do what I said (severity
minor + wontfix) since receiving agressive responses is one more reason
for me not to spent my time on this.
Kind regards
        Andreas.
