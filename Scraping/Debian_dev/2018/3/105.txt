While licensecheck might not be able to do that right now, it is clear
that it would be trivial to automatically detect that text, which is why
I asked.
Perhaps it's more work than licensecheck, or doesn't suit your
requirements, but there is also license-reconcile.
license-reconcile lets you add rules to deal with things that it doesn't
understand out of the box:
  http://git.hands.com/?p=freeswitch.git;a=blob;f=debian/license-reconcile.yml;h=0e40cba01eeb67f82d18ca8f11210271848d0549;hb=refs/heads/copyright2  
(as you can see, freeswitch is quite a jumble when it comes to
copyright)
Cheers, Phil.
