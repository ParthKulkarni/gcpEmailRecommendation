Indeed.  This is the first I have heard of combining wontfix+help, and I
suspect I'm not the only one.
I am not sure I can distinguish between your cases (2) and (3).  Isn't
the reason you need assistance that it requires too much effort to fix?
Or are you distinguishing between needing help because it's too much
effort and needing help because you don't have the requisite knowledge?
(There is a sense in which these are the same thing.)

Notwithstanding my comments above, I don't want to bikeshed, so yes, I
think such a sentence would be useful.
