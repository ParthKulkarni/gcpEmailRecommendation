There is one check that does certainly make sense for new binary packages,
which is: are the new binary package names namespace-polluting? Part
of the purpose of the NEW queue is to stop misleading or inappropriate
names from being used.
I think the reason for the copyright re-check being done at this point
might simply be that the ftp team are looking at the package anyway,
and the tools they're using were primarily designed for source-NEW.
I agree that both the copyright check and the namespace-pollution check
need to be done for source-NEW, and the namespace-pollution check needs
to be done for binary-NEW. I'm less sure about the value of a copyright
check at binary-NEW time.
