Second suggestion being networkd preferred over ifupdown?  yeah, I had 
thought this was going to come up eventually.  State it in plain english, 
if ifupdown is to be replaced, then let's get on with it.

I think the whole thread is unfortunate, because it was started by a 
person (Long Wind) who earlier posted a request for help about how to hack 
into their neighbor's wireless network to steal internet service.
I'm really shocked that anybody would try and make wireless easier to use 
for thieves.  They should be shunned, not used as example clueless users 
to implement fixes or new features.
Sorry to get personal, and apologies for being blunt if I offended.
