Fully agreed.  I'm not sure whether the bug in DAK described here[2]
which also forces packages through NEW which do not even have a name
change but have no binary but just a source package in the archive will
address this.
I had the discussion above with ftpmaster before and the argument is
that it is sensible to re-check random packages from time to time and
so checking new SOVERSION packages is one way to do so.  My argument
that actually this is *not* a *random* selection was not answered.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
