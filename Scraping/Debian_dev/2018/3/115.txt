To say ‚Äúshould‚Äù is rather too strong. I'm presenting it as one option to
try, for those who are frustrated at the slow review process for a large,
complex source package with complex copyright interactions: Break it
into more easily-reviewed pieces.
The review process is an acknowledged bottleneck for NEW queue
processing, and we've seen stated that large, complex source packages
are especially difficult to get through.
I'm proposing that the same code base as a set of smaller source
packages will get through that bottleneck easier; I don't say that as a
recommendation nor a ‚Äúshould‚Äù, but as an option to try, for those of us
who not FTPmaster and are looking for ways to work better with the
process.
