Besides this might be interesting I have another question.  You are using
   import gitlab
Which python3-gitlab are you using here?  Is this python3-gitlab 7.5.0-1
maintained by Benjamin Drung in collab-maint[1] (which is lagging
heavily behind upstream and seems unmaintained neither supporting API
v4) or rather the freshly ITPed (#891939) from Federico Ceratto which I
have set to Version 1:1.3.0 in Git[2] to have a higher version than the
old one.
I can confirm that I have successfully written a script to gather
metadata of Blends packages from Salsa[3] by using the latter.  I think
we should move forward and get some working python Gitlab module since
the need for this will increase.  Unfortunately both maintainers did
not respond yet to any of my mails (modulo a broken SPAM filter on my
side) and I wonder how we should proceed from here.
My favourite way of action would be to move the ITPed #891939 to
Python modules team, finalise the package, make it conflict with the
old package and remove the old one from Debian.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
