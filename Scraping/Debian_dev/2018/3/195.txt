Sure thing, I'll give it a try. Since I'm not familiar with the dak
code, would you be so kind to point me to the functions and variables
(if available) that are there to 
  - extract or hold the bugs listed in the last changelog entry,
  - query the BTS (to be able to get the header and see whether 
    it's a ITP) (if this is not available I can get that probably 
    from bugreport)
  - where you compose the final email (to add the bug in the CC).
Apart from that, AFAICS most of the discussion was around handling non-
ITP uploads that have to go through NEW, it's kind of orthogonal to
this proposal.

I've not seen all the other proposals, so I can't comment, but simply
asking the peers doesn't make the process very public. In the worst
case the exchange is private. Handling such a review within the BTS
would help making the process visible to all, and adding the "Reviewed-
By" to the changelog and posssibly to the QA page would give
recognizable reputation of the reviewers.
In any case, you are right that everything apart from adding the R-b to
the QA page can simply be done, a formalization would be nice but is
initially not needed. 
best,
