Note that m68k is not a release architecture, so those bugs do not affect the
release status of your packages. Thus, if you don't have the time to work on
such issues, you should feel free to note that and tag the bug 'help' or
similar, and wait for someone to provide a sensible patch.
OTOH, I'm not sure if those FTBFS for non-release architectures, without a patch
or a clue, coming from a non-porter, are that useful...
