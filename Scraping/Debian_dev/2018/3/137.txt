Hi Gert,

Do you have any concrete suggestions for packages that are "Just
Visiting" NEW, such as ones adding, say, a python3-foo, a -doc, a
SONAME bump, first upload to experimental, etc. etc.? They do not
have ITP bugs.
I have no real idea about the stats on this but my gut feel is that
this applies to at _least_ half of packages that pass through NEW.
(The current items in the NEW queue will be rather misleading on
this point.)
