  Description     : Python milter implementation of DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
 The dkimpy-milter is a Sendmail/Postfix Milter application that signs
 and verifies DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail).  It supports both traditional
 RSA (RFC 6376) signatures and the new ed25519 based signatures being
 developed by the IETF DCRUP (DKIM Crypto UPgrade) Working Group.
 .
 DKIM provides a way for senders to confirm their identity when sending email
 by adding a cryptographic signature to the headers of the message.
 .
 It uses the OpenDKIM configuration option naming and definitions, for the
 options it implements, to make it easy for OpenDKIM users to experiment with
 this alternative.
The primary alternative, which I also maintain, is opendkim.  Upstream isn't
dead, but it appears to be on life support.  I wrote this as an alternative so
I would have something modern and supported.  Currently it is the only DKIM
option for Postfix/Sendmail that supports ed25519 (there's also an unreleased
Exim implementation that this has been tested with to verify
interoperability).
Yes, it's python2.7, but the milter bindings it uses, python-milter, are not
yet avaialble for python3.  When they are, it'll be ported.
I plan to maintain this within the Python Applications Packaging Team.
