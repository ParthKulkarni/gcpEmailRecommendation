With my one of most active sponsors hat on: the current policy is that a
version that has never hit the archive must not have a separate changelog
entry, unless there are non-negligible users (such as a derivative, upstream
repository or at least the package being deployed to multiple users at a
workplace).  A past history is more acceptable than repeated attempts for an
upload.
This is what I was taught, and what I not only recommend but also require of
sponsorees.  There seems to be a concensus on -mentors that this is the
right way.
I'm not arguing that a change here is unacceptable, merely describing
currently agreed upon convention.
A changelog bloated with every replaced attempt is hard to read; gaps in
version numbering that come without an explanation also raise an eyebrow
(thus such a gap needs a comment in the changelog).
You can have private history published publicly in git, but it's best to
refrain from pushing a tag until the version has been accepted.  That's why
git doesn't push tags by default when you push the branch they apply to.
Meow!
