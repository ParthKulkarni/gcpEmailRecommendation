I use m68k Debian on real m68k hardware (but not R or other scientific
software). I know at least four other people that also run/use Debian
m68k on real hardware.
My focus use of m68k is tools and development software (interpreters,
compiler, assembler).
Supporting diverse hardware platforms can expose bugs that are hidden on
mainstream platforms (such as x86 and ARM) and increase the overall code
quality. But I agree that the m68k community is quite small.
