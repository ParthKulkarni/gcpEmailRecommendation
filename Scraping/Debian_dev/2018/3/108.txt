I Gert's initial mail he wrote that the second pass of the package took
six monthes.  So ftpmaster has managed to do the large amount of work.
The question was how we can make dealing with the remaining issues that
should probably cost less work then one day more efficient.

IMHO this question does not fit the problem Gert wants to address.  My
answer to it would be:  I'm fine if ftpmaster is taking low hanging
fruits first.  The question what is actually a low hanging fruit and how
we can make fruits hanging lower remains unanswered.
Another very personal opinion:  For my definition of "universal
operating system" also complex packages belong to our targets.
Kind regards
        Andreas.
