  Description     : : A Modern Library for 3D Data Processing
Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of
software that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of
carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python.
The backend is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization.
