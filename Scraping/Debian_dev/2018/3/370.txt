 Daemonize Go applications with exec() instead of fork().
 .
 You can't daemonize the usual way in Go. Daemonizing is a Unix concept
 that requires some specific things (http://goo.gl/vTUsVy) you can't do
 easily in Go. But you can still accomplish the same goals if you don't
 mind that your program will start copies of itself several times, as
 opposed to using fork() the way many programmers are accustomed to doing.
