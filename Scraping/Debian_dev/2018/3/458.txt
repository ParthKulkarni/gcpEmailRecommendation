If that happens, I leave the Debian project for good. The answer is no!

To be honest, lots of that scientific code has questionable quality
and I have seen lots of packages from the Debian Science team with
hard-coded compiler options and other non-sense. So, to be honest,
I could send the same statement into your direction: Those science
packages should be kicked out due to their low quality.
As for the m68k port: There is a large user base around the Amiga
and Atari groups and it would therefore be not acceptable to remove
something that people use.
Thanks,
Adrian
