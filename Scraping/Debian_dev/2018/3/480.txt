That sounds like a similar confusion over severity - often interpreted 
by bugreporters as tied to the bugreporter, where we kindly inform that 
it is meant to reflect the distribution as a whole:
Seems the logic of Bugzilla (and Debian?) is that "wontfix is intended 
to be tied to the distribution as a whole, not the (current) maintainer 
of a package.
That logic makes sense to me, but I have personally interpreted it as 
tied to me as maintainer.
I would support simply adding a note to the documentation of our 
bugtracker that "wontfix" is tied to the project as a whole (which still 
leaves room for strongly opinionated maintainers to interpret that as 
"hell yeah, I hate that and I choose to speak for us all in hating that, 
so WONTFIX you go!"
