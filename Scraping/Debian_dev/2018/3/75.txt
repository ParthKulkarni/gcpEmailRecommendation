While a bit off-topic, in November 2017 i shortly thought about
jumping over the big package maintainer hurdle of Debian and
installed it (the only Debian i ever had was 3.0 "Woody").  I have
used netinstall, and unselected all possible checkboxes (no X11,
no cups, the rest if have forgotten).  This resulted in i think
one and a half gigabytes of download.  I even had LibreOffice,
which i never had around until then.  (It was of course
_completely_ unusable here, even opening a menu required half
a minute.)  Now i know how it looks!  I had to shutdown the VM
hard, because i was unable to find a button or way to open
a console or at least command line input window.  (And i became
frustrated because moving around the cursor was _so_ slow, i think
every move caused swapping or something.)
