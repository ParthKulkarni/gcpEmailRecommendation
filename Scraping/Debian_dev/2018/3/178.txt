If you consider it absurd to not increment the revision due to changes that 
never made it in the archive, then I don't know where it stops.  I admit, this 
was hyperbole, but Ian's extremism annoys me.  I should do a better job of 
ignoring it.

Sure.  I completely agree that there are cases where it's reasonable to do so.  
All I'm arguing is that it's not absurd not to.  There are quite reasonable 
cases where one need not do so and it leaves, IMO, a cleaner history.
Honestly, I think Ian's use of 'absurd' was absurd.  I think there are 
reasonable cases for doing it either way and there's no need to be absolutist 
about it.
I'm not sure you actually read what I wrote since I wrote that I thought 
REQUIRING the revision to be bumped was a bad idea and you gave me a case 
where it made sense to do so.  Nowhere in this thread have I ever said bumping 
the revision is inherently a bad idea.
These threads spin off into endless tangents easily enough without people 
writing responses to what they imagined other people wrote.
