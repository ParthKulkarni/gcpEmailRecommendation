Hi Dominique,
I've got an explicit pointer to this mail[1] (I admit I was a bit distracted
at that time (flu) ).

I confirm this works nicely, specifically I like the "commit" feature.  (My
workflow is "cme fix ...; git diff ; git commit" - at first sight I assumed
nothing had happened since `git diff` was empty ;-) )

Thanks a lot.
In the discussion about the new lintian warning[2] I said: "I will not
change Vcs fields until cme is doing this for me."  To be more precise I
would now rather say:
   ... before  `cme fix dpkg-control`  is doing it for me.
While I disagree with the opinion of Alioth admins that there should be
no chance to save anonscm.d.o ("Because it wouldn't work." is no
sensible reason for me) it seems I need to face reality that things will
not happen if I do not setup a redirector for anonscm.d.o myself.  Do you
see any chance to add the set-vcs-git feature to
     cme fix dpkg-control
?  If lintian claims d/control is wrong cme could do this in the "fix"
step.  Does this make sense to you?
BTW, can you explain the philosophy behind `cme run` and `cme fix`.  Or
in other words, why is this
$ cme fix set-vcs-git
Can't locate model for application 'set-vcs-git'.
Run 'cme list' for the list of models available on your system.
You may need to install another Config::Model Perl module.
See the available models there: https://github.com/dod38fr/config-model/wiki/Available-models-and-backends
$ cme run dpkg-control
Error: cannot find script dpkg-control
not working?
As always thanks a lot for providing very useful features for cme
     Andreas.
