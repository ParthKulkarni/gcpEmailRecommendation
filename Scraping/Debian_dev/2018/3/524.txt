Hello,
not only for files newly created but also for changes done to the end of 
a file, there is no terminal \n.
Knowing that I will now just go and add an extra empty line at the 
bottom of the text/source code files edited, but, well, maybe there is a 
bit more UNIXish solution to that?
Cheers,
Steffen
