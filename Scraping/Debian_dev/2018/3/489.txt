The case which caused this thread was[0] "maintainer does not have the
time/inclination to investigate/fix bugs on this non-release
architecture", the implication being that "the porters of that arch
should deal with this bug and provide a patch which the maintainer will
evaluate".
To that end perhaps this is a special enough case of "help" that a
specific "porter" tag is warranted? (or perhaps a set of "porter-ARCH"
tags or a combination of "porter" and "ARCH" tags, or whatever). In
fact I don't see why we would limit it to non-release arches, it seems
useful for release arches too.
Or perhaps this just needs a consensus on the appropriate use of some
`port@debian.org` usertags?
