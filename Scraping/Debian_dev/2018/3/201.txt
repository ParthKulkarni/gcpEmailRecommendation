Funny that a Gitlab API is maintained at Github ...

I intended to run some Python scripts against Salsa and realised that
the packaged pyapi-gitlab is way outdated but had some better success
with latest upstream 7.8.4.  I was about to ping the maintainer Benjamin
Drung (in CC) about the status.  In any case I agree that we do not need
an outdated API which is not even actively maintained any more.

I cloned this for testing the package and the files in your pristine-tar
branch are not properly named accourding to the source package name.  If
you want me to push my fix I can do so.  I'll let you know about other
issues I might face when testing the package.
Apropos name choice: I do not fully understand why you choose the
repository name python-pygitlab (instead of python-gitlab) nor why you
do not maintain this in Debian Python Modules Team (where it should
belong to IMHO).
Kind regards
      Andreas.
