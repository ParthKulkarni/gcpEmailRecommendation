  Description     : Bridge that makes it simple to use conventional text streams
 Use conventional text streams at the start of your gulp or vinyl pipelines,
 making for nicer interoperability with the existing npm stream ecosystem.
 .
 Take, for example, browserify. There are the gulp-browserify and gulpify
 plugins, which you can use in combination with gulp to get browserify working
 in your build. Unfortunately, these plugins come with additional overhead:
 an extra GitHub repository, npm module, maintainer, tests, semantics, etc.
 It's much simpler in this case to use the original module directly where you
 can, which is what vinyl-source-stream handles for you.
This is a Node.js module necessary to package a software name shellshare.
