  Description     : C++ implementation of a fast hash map and hash set
The robin-map library is a C++ implementation of a fast hash map and
hash set using open-addressing and linear robin hood hashing with
backward shift deletion to resolve collisions.
Four classes are provided: tsl::robin_map, tsl::robin_set,
tsl::robin_pg_map and tsl::robin_pg_set. The first two are faster and
use a power of two growth policy, the last two use a prime growth policy
instead and are able to cope better with a poor hash function. Use the
prime version if there is a chance of repeating patterns in the lower
bits of your hash (e.g. you are storing pointers with an identity hash
function).
======================================================================
These few header files are only used by OpenImageIO 2.0.x at the moment
and, since buildd infrastructure forbids network access, they have to be
packaged and used locally.
I'll be the main maintainer for this package.
