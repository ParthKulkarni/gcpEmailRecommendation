  Description     : PKIX certificates management library for Erlang
 The idea of the library is to simplify certificates configuration in Erlang
 programs. Typically an Erlang program which needs certificates  (for HTTPS/
 MQTT/XMPP/etc) provides a bunch of options such as certfile,  chainfile,
 privkey, etc. The situation becomes even more complicated when a  server
 supports so called virtual domains because a program is typically  required to
 match a virtual domain with its certificate. If a user has plenty  of virtual
 domains it's quickly becoming a nightmare for them to configure all this.
 The complexity also leads to errors: a single configuration mistake and a
 program generates obscure log messages, unreadable Erlang tracebacks or,
 even worse, just silently ignores the errors.
 Fortunately, the large part of certificates configuration can be automated,
 reducing a user configuration to something as simple as:
 .
 certfiles:
   - /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/*.pem
 .
 The purpose of this library is to do this dirty job under the hood.
 
 This package is needed for future ejabberd releases.
