* Package name    : siconos

  Programming Lang: C, C++, Python
  Description     : modeling and simulation of nonsmooth dynamical systems
Siconos is an open-source scientific software primarily targeted at
modeling and simulating nonsmooth dynamical systems in C++ and in
Python:
  * Mechanical systems (rigid or solid) with unilateral contact and
    Coulomb friction and impact (nonsmooth mechanics, contact dynamics,
    multibody systems dynamics or granular materials).
  * Switched Electrical Circuit such as electrical circuits with ideal
    and piecewise linear components: power converter, rectifier,
    Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) or Analog-to-Digital converter.
  * Sliding mode control systems.
  * Biology (Gene regulatory network).
Other applications are found in Systems and Control (hybrid systems,
differential inclusions, optimal control with state constraints),
Optimization (Complementarity systems and Variational inequalities),
Fluid Mechanics, and Computer Graphics.
I propose this package for maintenance under the Debian Science team,
of which I am a guest member, and I plan to continue maintaining this
package for the foreseeable future.
