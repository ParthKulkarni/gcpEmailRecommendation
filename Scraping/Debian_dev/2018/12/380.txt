Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I intend to orphan the reportbug-ng package. I've been asking for help
maintaining it years ago without response, so I'm now orphaning it. The current
popcon value is around 300, so it may be save to just get rid of it. Also
reportbug gained a lot more user friendly GUI since I wrote reportbug-ng so
removing it from the archive might not be a big loss.
The package description is:
 Reportbug-NG is a graphical interface using Qt for searching, filtering,
 reporting or manipulating bugs in Debian's Bug Tracking System.
