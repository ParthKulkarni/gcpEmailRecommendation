  Description     : pytest plugin to randomise the order of tests (Python 3)
pytest-random-order is a pytest plugin that randomises the order of tests.
This can be useful to detect a test that passes just because it happens to
run after an unrelated test that leaves the system in a favourable state.
The plugin allows the user to control the level of randomness they want to
introduce and to disable reordering on subsets of tests. Tests can be rerun
in a specific order by passing a seed value reported in a previous test run.
This package installs the pytest plugin for Python 3.
I plan to maintain this package in the Debian Python Modules Team.
