I would suggest talking to the upstream developer of pd-csound. It seems
reasonably likely that their users will be confused by the fact that
that version 1.01.0 of the "Csound external" (I assume that's some sort
of loadable module, analogous to a Python module?) is newer/better than
version 6.08.0 of the Csound external, despite its lower version number?
If they agree that this is confusing, they might be willing to re-version
to 7.01.0 or something, so that version numbers keep going up.
If they are unwilling to change the version number, then bumping the
epoch seems like a correct Debian-level workaround for the version
numbering scheme having been reset.
