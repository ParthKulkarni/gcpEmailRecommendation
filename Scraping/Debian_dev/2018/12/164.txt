  Description     : distributed pub-sub messaging platform
I intend to maintain this package until it will be ready to hand
over to Debian Java Maintainers.
This is a large project and there are significant challenges:
1. getting the build to succeed with maven-debian-helper
2. fixing dependency requirements (downgrading or upgrading
   versions) for the dependencies that are already properly
   packaged; also fixing dependencies that are packaged but broken
   in some way
3. packaging dozens of dependencies that are not yet in Debian.
