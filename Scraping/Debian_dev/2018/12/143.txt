  Description     : jQuery based universal markup editor
 markItUp! is a JavaScript plugin built on the jQuery library. It allows
 you to turn any textarea into a markup editor. Html, Textile, Wiki
 Syntax, Markdown, BBcode or even your own Markup system can be easily
 implemented.
 .
 markItUp! is not meant to be a “Full-Features-Out-of-the-Box”-editor.
 Instead it is a very lightweight, customizable and flexible engine made
 to meet the developer's needs in their CMSes, blogs, forums or websites.
 markItUp! is not a WYSIWYG editor, and it never will be.
 .
 This Javascript library is required by the upcoming OpenBoard upload,
 will be shipped under the umbrella of the Debian Javascript Team _and_
 will be co-maintained by the Debian Edu Packaging Team.
