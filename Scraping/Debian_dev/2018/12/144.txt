  Description     : Proxy for RTP and media streams
The Sipwise NGCP rtpengine is a proxy for RTP traffic and other UDP based media
traffic. It's meant to be used with the Kamailio SIP proxy and forms a drop-in
replacement for any of the other available RTP and media proxies.
Currently the only supported platform is GNU/Linux.
Features
    Media traffic running over either IPv4 or IPv6
    Bridging between IPv4 and IPv6 user agents
    Bridging between different IP networks or interfaces
    TOS/QoS field setting
    Customizable port range
    Multi-threaded
    Advertising different addresses for operation behind NAT
    In-kernel packet forwarding for low-latency and low-CPU performance
    Automatic fallback to normal userspace operation if kernel module is unavailable
    Support for Kamailio's rtpproxy module
    Legacy support for old OpenSER mediaproxy module
When used through the rtpengine module (or its older counterpart called
rtpproxy-ng), the following additional features are available:
    Full SDP parsing and rewriting
    Supports non-standard RTCP ports (RFC 3605)
    ICE (RFC 5245) support:
        Bridging between ICE-enabled and ICE-unaware user agents
        Optionally acting only as additional ICE relay/candidate
        Optionally forcing relay of media streams by removing other ICE candidates
    SRTP (RFC 3711) support:
        Support for SDES (RFC 4568) and DTLS-SRTP (RFC 5764)
        AES-CM and AES-F8 ciphers, both in userspace and in kernel
        HMAC-SHA1 packet authentication
        Bridging between RTP and SRTP user agents
    Support for RTCP profile with feedback extensions (RTP/AVPF, RFC 4585 and 5124)
    Arbitrary bridging between any of the supported RTP profiles (RTP/AVP, RTP/AVPF, RTP/SAVP, RTP/SAVPF)
    RTP/RTCP multiplexing (RFC 5761) and demultiplexing
    Breaking of BUNDLE'd media streams (draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation)
    Recording of media streams, decrypted if possible
    Transcoding and repacketization
Rtpengine does not (yet) support:
    Playback of pre-recorded streams/announcements
    ZRTP, although ZRTP passes through rtpengine just fine
This package will be maintained under the pkg-voip team umbrella
