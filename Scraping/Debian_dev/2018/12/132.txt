It remains available from upstream.
The monodevelop package has been removed from Debian, as there were not 
enough maintainers to handle its large number of dependencies (the 
debian-cli list has received nothing but spam for nearly 2 years):

The crash is probably this bug, which has a possible workaround (though 
I haven't tried it myself):
