The mirror to use is configured in /etc/apt/sources.list -- or, on some
derivatives in files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
You can edit it to choose any mirror you want.  It's also possible it's set
to deb.debian.org which is a CDN that tries to detect something appropriate
for you -- but often picks something closeness-challenged.
