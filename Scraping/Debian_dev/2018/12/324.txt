And I said I think it should start independently to prove its worth the work. 
And it isn't backports infrastructure. It is ftpmaster's, we are just users.
We can't even add anything, even if we want to. The only things we control
are the NEW queue of the backports-suites ( a new suite with have its own
queue) and the website (which also doesn't fit for the new suite). So imho
addressing this as a backports topic is just wrong.
