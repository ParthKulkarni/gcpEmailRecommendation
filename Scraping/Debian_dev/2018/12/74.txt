This is a simple module (single ES5 file, 26 LOC according to sloccount, no build steps required).
Although on npm register (https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl-source-stream) it has 767 dependents, until now we managed to avoid packaging it in Debian (https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=vinyl-source-stream).
Possibly you can skip it too, by tweaking the gulpfile.js; but if you really need it, it could a good candidate for embedding, see:

Please get in touch with the JS team on pkg-javascript-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net if you need assistance.
