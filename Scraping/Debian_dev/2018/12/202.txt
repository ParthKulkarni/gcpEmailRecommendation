I don't agree with that. Please refer to my another mail to see what's
really broken if debugging symbols are stripped, if you are still
interested in it.

Julia became a special case since it nearly zeroed the gap between
compiled language and interpreted language. And AFAIK such case
didn't happen to other parts of Debian...
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 155M Dec 21 02:38 sys.so
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 128M Dec 21 02:53 sys.so.stripped
^ And sys.so is not bloated by debugging symbols.
(155-128)/155 = 17.4%
