Hello Debian,
Sorry if it is wrong list, but I do not see list dedicated to Mono for
Debian. I'm usually Java developer. For long time I have been doing
customizations of Java application called Compiere. It is open source
ERP written in Java. With current Oracle move to depreciate Swing GUI I
just think to have something different.
I look into Python Tryton ERP, but Mono and GTK seems to be interesting
 option. Posibility to use shared objects in Mono is something what
just makes things much more simple.
So here is my question. What is current status of Mono in Debian. I
tried to run MonoDevelop, but it gives me error when tring to save new
project:
*** Error in `monodevelop': free(): invalid pointer: 0x0000559762a874b0
