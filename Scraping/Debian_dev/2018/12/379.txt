  Description     : GNU C compiler for Xtensa lx106 core
Bare metal C cross compiler for chips using the Xtensa lx106 core, such
as the Espressif ESP8266 wireless SoCs. This package is primarily for
those developing for the ESP8266 platform and is not needed by normal
users or developers.
This is the counterpart to the binutils-xtensa-lx106 ITP (#917546). As
stated there the ESP8266 is a commonly used component in the IoT
ecosystem; devices such as the SonOff power switches and various wifi
lightbulbs are all based upon it, as well as a full Arduino stack being
available.  Espressif have committed to availability until at least
2026. As this is targeted towards embedded platforms it will be
maintained within the Debian Electronics Team. It is built using the
gcc-8-source base package rather than pulling in an additional copy of
gcc-8.
