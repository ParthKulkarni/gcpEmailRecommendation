This discussion usually happens in companies when one of the directors
gets spam forged from their own company mail address. They then
proceed to ask why it is possible that total strangers can send mail
with company senders. They then demand that action must be taken to
prevent this, which usually breaks a multitude of production systems
in the process and cause tens of thousands of dollars in damages.
