  Description     : filtering D-Bus proxy
xdg-dbus-proxy is a filtering proxy for D-Bus connections. It was
originally part of the Flatpak project, but it has been broken out as
a standalone module to facilitate using it in other contexts.
For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
container).

Flatpak currently uses a bundled copy of xdg-dbus-proxy 0.1.0 as
a git submodule, but I expect to switch it to use this package when
available. Development versions of WebKitGTK+ apparently use it for
process sandboxing (presumably alongside bubblewrap) or will do so soon.
