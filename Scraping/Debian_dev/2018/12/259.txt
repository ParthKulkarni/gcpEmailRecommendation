Explicit boot loader support is useful in any case because if your
system fails to boot after switching init then you need a way to switch
back.  (Yes, this is a special case of boot problems that need rescue
media; but switching init is an easily-foreseeable special case where
teething problems are more likely than usual, and the cost of offering
the option is negligible.)
