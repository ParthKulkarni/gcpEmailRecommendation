  Description     : graphical diff and merge tool for TMX files
Standard text-based diff and merge tools can work with TMX files, but
they will operate on the raw XML text of the file, without understanding
the content. This can result in confusing, unreadable diffs, or in some
cases merges that result in malformed XML.
SuperTMXMerge understands the underlying format and presents diffs and
merges in a (relatively) intuitive way.
Note: The "merging" implemented by this tool is known as [3-way merge]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_%28revision_control%29#Three-way_merge).
To simply combine the unique text units of multiple TMXs into a single
TMX, please use the "combine" feature, not the merge feature.
This tool and its library is a dependency of OmegaT.
