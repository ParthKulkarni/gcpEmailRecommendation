  Description     : Expect for Shells
Expect is for Tcl. Expect.pm is for Perl. Pexpect is for Python. ... But
what for shells?
Quite often, shell scripters need to use Expect to progmatically
interact with another program. The big problem is they don't have time
to learn Tcl's syntax or they don't want to.
I developed "sexpect" which is a single program. It works like GNU
screen. It runs the spawned process on a pty in background as a daemon
and it can talk with the daemon and control the spawned process.
Example:
 # sexpect spawn ssh user@host echo hello world
 # sexpect expect -nocase password:
 # sexpect send -cstring 'password\r'
 # sexpect expect -eof
 # sexpect wait
