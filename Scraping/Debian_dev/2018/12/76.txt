  Description     : nss module to handle unknown uids
 nss-unknown is a small library to gracefully handle unknown uids
This small library is very useful in host <=> guest container
environments. Under certian circumstances, admins can have UIDs/GIDs
colliding inbetween hosts/guests. Certain system services (like dbus
etc) are picky and become very unhappy under such scenarios.
We primarily use this library in our environment in the guest
containers. Thus I intend to maintain it for the forseeable future.
