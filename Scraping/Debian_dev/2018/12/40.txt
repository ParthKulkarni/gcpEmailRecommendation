I very much disagree over this as a general principle, be it for
sysvinit or systemd, or whatever other feature a package might provide
that might be optionally used, but the maintainer does not use.
This is the antithesis of what a distribution is supposed to be doing.

And I still object to this characterization, because the metadata is
the lesser of the problems when it comes to overhead. Few small packages
might be fine, tons of them is an organizational bug:
