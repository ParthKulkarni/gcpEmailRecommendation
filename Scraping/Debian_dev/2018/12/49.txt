  Description     : Magic Wormhole Mailbox Server
This is the main server that Magic-Wormhole clients connect to. The
server performs store-and-forward delivery for small key-exchange and
control messages. Bulk data is sent over a direct TCP connection, or
through a transit-relay.
Clients connect with WebSockets, for low-latency delivery in the happy
case where both clients are attached at the same time. Message are
stored to enable non-simultaneous clients to make forward
progress. The server uses a small SQLite database for persistence (and
clients will reconnect automatically, allowing the server to be
rebooted without losing state). An optional "usage DB" tracks
historical activity for status monitoring and operational maintenance.
==
This is necessary for magic-wormhole 0.11.2 tests to pass as they
include code from this package, which is now split out in a
different upstream repository.
It can also be useful for people who want to run their own custom
wormhole-based system without using any of the global wormhole
architecture.
