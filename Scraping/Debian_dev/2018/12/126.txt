Hi,
just a note that I've re-introduced versioned Provides in
perl/perl-base/perl-modules-5.28 with 5.28.1-3.  This was briefly in
sid in July 2017 but had to be reverted [1] due to infrastructure issues
(#867104 / wanna-build and #867081 / autopkgtest) back then. The issues
have since been fixed, so I'm hoping everything will Just Work this time.
Please let us know (via debian-perl@ldo, perl@pdo or otherwise) should
any issues emerge.
No immediate action is required from packages affected by this change,
but they can now gradually start moving from the current idiom
 Depends: perl (>= x) | libfoo-bar-perl (>= y)
to just the 'libfoo-bar-perl (>= y)' part. This will need some changes
to lintian recommendations as well.
See #758100 for more information on the change.

Happy hacking,
