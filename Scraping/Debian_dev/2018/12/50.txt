I did not remember this quote from TC. Sounds like solution.
Not that I think it is the best way, but since Debian already provide
sysvinit and systemd scripts as part of main package, I will follow this
tradition. Probably, we could add several sentences into policy,
deprecating *-run packages.
Idea with creating logging users with trigger on `runit' installation
also sounds nice. I will definitely take a look.
Lorenzo, another bright side is that it solves ownership question. There
will be no question, what to do if at time of -run package installation
daemon already running.
Users of runit-sysv/runit-systemd (which I always considered as
non-priority) will have to manually choose, who of sysvinit/runit/systemd
will manage given daemon.
