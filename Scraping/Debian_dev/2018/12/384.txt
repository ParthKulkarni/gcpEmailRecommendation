  Description     : OpenStack plugin for the Rally benchmark system
 Rally is a Benchmark-as-a-Service project for OpenStack.
 .
 Rally is intended to provide the community with a benchmarking tool that is
 capable of performing specific, complicated and reproducible test cases on
 real deployment scenarios.
 .
 This package contains the Python code of the OpenStack pluggin.
Note: Rally is now split into plugins. Without this plugin, there's no way to
make Rally work with OpenStack anymore, so I'm packaging this plugin.
