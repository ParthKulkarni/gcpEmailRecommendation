  Description     : a high-performance, POSIX-ish Amazon S3 file system written in Go
 Goofys is a high-performance, POSIX-ish Amazon S3
 (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) file system written in Go
 .
 It's a Filey System instead of a File System because goofys strives
 for performance first and POSIX second. Particularly things that
 are difficult to support on S3 or would translate into more than one
 round-trip would either fail (random writes) or faked (no per-file
 permission). Goofys does not have an on disk data cache, and
 consistency model is close-to-open.
