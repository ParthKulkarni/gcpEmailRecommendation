  Description     : Nostalgic side action adventure game
 Cave Story is a side-scrolling platform game that can be played with either
 the keyboard or a gamepad. Players will solve puzzles and fight enemies on
 each map while trying to collect weapons and items to help him along the way.
 .
 Includes some RPG elements with more than three dozen different items that
 can be found and stored in the player's inventory for later use.
 .
 Players won't get tired of fighting the same monsters over and over again
 simply because there are so many different monsters in game and there always
 seems to be something new to tackle where each representing a unique set of
 challenges that the player must overcome to defeat.
