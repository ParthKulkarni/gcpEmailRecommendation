Description:  toolset for the Buildstream project
 BuildStream is a GNOME project to improve the continuous integration of
 complex systems and applications. The project aims to pay special
 attention to those developers and integrators who care about the
 maintainability of their projects during a long period of time.
 .
 BuildStream is also a powerful and flexible software integration toolset.
 It has been designed to create different outputs out of a unique input
 and, at the same time, it is able to adapt to complex workflows, even
 when additional build tools are required. An important part of
 BuildStream is a sister project called BuildGrid, that allows
 BuildStream to build at scale.
Other Info
--------------
Note that this package installs a new 3-letter binary: /usr/bin/bst
I intend to maintain this with the Debian GNOME Team.
Initial packaging is at https://salsa.debian.org/gnome-team/buildstream/
Docs are at https://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream/
BuildStream is sort of, but not really, a replacement for jhbuild.
BuildStream is used to build GNOME releases (since GNOME 3.28) and the
Freedesktop SDKs. The GNOME and KDE Flatpak runtimes depend on the
Freedesktop SDKs.
Thanks,
