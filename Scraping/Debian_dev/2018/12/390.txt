  Description     : Common Lisp library that creates namespaces for named readtables
Named-Readtables is a library that provides a namespace for readtables akin to
the already-existing namespace of packages in Common Lisp. In particular:
 - you can associate readtables with names, and retrieve readtables by names;
 - you can associate source files with readtable names, and be sure that the
   right readtable is active when compiling/loading the file;
 - similarly, your development environment now has a chance to automatically
   determine what readtable should be active while processing source forms on
   interactive commands. (E.g. think of `C-c C-c` in Slime (yet to be done))
It follows that Named-Readtables is a facility for using readtables in
a localized way.
Additionally, it also attempts to become a facility for using
readtables in a modular way. In particular:
 - it provides a macro to specify the content of a readtable at a glance;
 - it makes it possible to use multiple inheritance between readtables.
This package is a new dependency of cl-interpol.
It will be maintained within the Debian Common Lisp Team.
