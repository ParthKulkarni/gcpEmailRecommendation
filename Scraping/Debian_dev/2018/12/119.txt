Just because you like a tool doesn't mean everyone does. I know I
understand patches and tarballs much better than I understand git, so
I prefer to use the former.
To answer your original question about DFSG differences, the
difference between upstream and the DFSG is normally defined by
'Files-Excluded' in the copyright file and compression/name
transformations in the watch file. It is for my packages, anyway.
