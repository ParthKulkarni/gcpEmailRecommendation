I don't think u-a has used any shell in any of its recent history. The
only external thing u-a itself it currently still uses is mv(1) via an
execvp(3), *only* in case a rename(3) failed for example due to a
cross-device move.

But it should! It uses a temporary file first and then does the usual
atomic rename(3) dance over it. If there is any place where this is
not the case, I'm also happy to hear. :)

It's still as important, as you might suffer from a sudden crash and
be left w/o a /bin/init program.
