Hi,
I’ve just uploaded hostapd and wpa-supplicant 2.7 to experimental, and
they should be available to install in a couple of hours.
Please give those versions a test. I’ve been running on a Git snapshot
of 2.7 for a couple of months now and I haven’t found any serious
regressions, so I suppose 2.7 should not introduce much breakage
compared to 2.6.
If all goes well, I intend to upload it to unstable soon.
