  Description     : Automated testing for the examples in your documentation
This library provides a way to test examples in your documentation by
parsing them from the documentation source and evaluating the parsed
examples as part of your normal test run. Integration is provided for the
three main Python test runners. Sybil is designed so that itâ€™s easy
to provide your own parsers for your own types of example in addition
to the included parsers for doctest and code-block examples.
Sybil is heavily inspired by Manuel, which was named after a Fawlty
Towers character, and so it seemed only right to pick another Fawtly
Towers character name for this library.
Sybil is a dependency of the releases of python-testfixtures >= 5.0.0
