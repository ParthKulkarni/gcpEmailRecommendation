  Description     : Build GUI for your Python program with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
pywebview is a lightweight cross-platform wrapper around a webview component
that allows on to display HTML content in its own native GUI window. It gives
you power of web technologies in your desktop application, hiding the fact
that GUI is browser based. You can use pywebview either with a lightweight web
framework like Flask or Bottle or on its own with a two way bridge between
Python and DOM.
pywebview uses native GUI for creating a web component window: WinForms on
Windows, Cocoa on macOS and QT or GTK+ on Linux. If you choose to freeze your
application, pywebview does not bundle a heavy GUI toolkit or web renderer
with it keeping the executable size small. pywebview is compatible with both
Python 2 and 3.
Used in F-Droid repomaker. I will put it into DPMT.
