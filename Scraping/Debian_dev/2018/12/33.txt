Hrrmf, clearly not very clear. Let's try again:
  - Aliasing directory components can create multiple source pathnames
    (before any readlink) that refer to the exact same dentry.
  - Aliasing final components means that the source pathnames are
    always different, and as such they always point to different
    dentries, even if they might end up pointing to the same
    destination pathname once canonicalized.
Thanks,
