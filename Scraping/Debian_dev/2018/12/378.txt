  Description     : GNU binary utilities, for Xtensa lx106 core
Bare metal binutils for chips using the Xtensa lx106 core, such as the
Espressif ESP8266 wireless modules. The programs in this package are
used to manipulate binary and object files that may have been created
for the Xtensa architecture. This package is primarily for those
developing for the ESP8266 platform and is not needed by normal users or
developers.
The ESP8266 is a commonly used component in the IoT ecosystem; devices
such as the SonOff power switches and various wifi lightbulbs are all
based upon it, as well as a full Arduino stack being available.
Espressif have committed to availability until at least 2026. As this is
targeted towards embedded platforms it will be maintained within the
Debian Electronics Team. It is built using the binutils-source base
package rather than pulling in an additional copy of binutils.
