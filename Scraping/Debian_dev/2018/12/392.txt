  Description     : Prometheus Client Library for Modern C++
This library aims to enable Metrics-Driven Development for C++ services.
It implements the Prometheus Data Model, a powerful abstraction on which
to collect and expose metrics. It offers the possibility for metrics to
be collected by Prometheus, but other push/pull collections can be added
as plugins.
Providing this library for the Debian ecosystem might help to overcome
the chicken-and-egg problem and hopefully will encourage more C++
based services to provide metrics.
Thanks,
Gregor
