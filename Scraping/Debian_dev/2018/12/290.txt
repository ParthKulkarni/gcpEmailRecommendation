Hi Samuel,
(replying above the message as it's all quite relevant but I don't have
anything specific to comment on)
It's true that I have a lot less time nowadays than a couple of years
ago to spend on Debian, unfortunately. This is becoming more and more
obvious.
Feel free to upload a new release with your changes. I'd like to still
be to "official" maintainer, so I would like to review your stuff first.
Thanks for your work!
Paul
