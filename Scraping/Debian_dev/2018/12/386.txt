  Description     : Lib3MF is a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard.
As 3MF shall become an universal 3D Printing standard, its quick adoption is
very important. This library shall lower all barriers of adoption to any
possible user, let it be software providers, hardware providers, service
providers or middleware tools. The specification can be downloaded at
http://3mf.io/specification/
Its aim is to offer an open source way to integrate 3MF reading and writing
capabilities, as well as conversion and validation tools for input and output
data. The 3MF Library shall provide a clean and easy-to-use API to speed up the
development and keep integration costs at a minimum.
A lot of energy has been put into keeping it as platform independent as far as
possible. For example, it compiles well with the GCC compiler, but there is
some work left to recode a few platform specific functionalities, which are now
covered by the WinRT platform (like XML parsing and ZIP compression). This will
come when time passes.
This library will be used by OpenSCAD for importing and exporting 3MF files.
