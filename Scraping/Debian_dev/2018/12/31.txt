This is impossibile: it will NEVER be practical to change paths like 
/bin/sh and /lib/ld-linux.so.2, so there will always be symlinks in the

There was an open bug but nobody could reproduce it and the cause of the 
problem was not clear at all, at least to me. The adopted solution was 
also trivial, so if it was so obvious maybe you could have told 
somebody?

Maybe I missed that too?

Yes, but since it does not cause practical problems I think that we can 
live with it.
