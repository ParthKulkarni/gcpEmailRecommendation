Oooh, sounds like you have at least some clue here -- _and_ there are
non-trivial things one should know.  As you can tell from my vitriol,
there's no way I'm going to use anything from nVidia -- yet I need to
replace most of my main home box quite badly.
Thus, are there any particular setups you'd recommend for someone running
unstable and Linus' current kernels?
Running -rc kernels is especially unfun if your card requires nVidia's
proprietary drivers (and so are X transitions in unstable).  Nouveau on the
other hand has problems on this own, usually crashes -- some reproducible
(like enabling xfce's compositor), some random.
The card I have right now crashed under load roughly once a week -- until I
got a higher resolution monitor.  Afterwards, the card can handle static
images (editor, browser, ...), but if I try a video or such, it crashes
every ~10 minutes bringing the whole kernel down.  Speak about "replacement
needed urgently"...
But, I don't blame this particular card.  Its predecessor went down in a
fire (thick smoke for the entire room, small but visible actual flame) so
it's likely the PCIe slot is suspect, not worth the risk replacing just the
GPU without a whole new motherboard (I put in an old but unopened card I
happened to have on storage).  I think I get the message this machine is
telling me...
A decade ago, ATI/AMD drivers were abysmal.  If I understand you right,
they have recently massively improved -- for the values of "recently" of
"not yet in Stretch" (which is fine for the likes of us).  After a string of
4 nVidia cards that brought me nothing but woe, I wish for something that
actually works.  And it'd be so nice if instead of having to do the
research, this here Ben guy told me "do this" so I can return to hacking on
things that have nothing in common with graphics drivers. :)
