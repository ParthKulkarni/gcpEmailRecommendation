  Description     : Open Neural Network Exchange
Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is the first step toward an open
ecosystem that empowers AI developers to choose the right tools as their
project evolves. ONNX provides an open source format for AI models. It
defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of
built-in operators and standard data types. Initially we focus on the
capabilities needed for inferencing (evaluation).
Caffe2, PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Apache MXNet and other
tools are developing ONNX support. Enabling interoperability between
different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to
production will increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. We
are an early stage and we invite the community to submit feedback and
help us further evolve ONNX.
