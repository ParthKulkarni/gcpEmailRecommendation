This is a very wrong assumption, the OpenGL on a RPi (all of them) is
hardware accelerated via the VC4 mesa driver by Eric Anholt which is
shipped, by default, on by Raspbian. It supports up to OpenGL 2.1 and
if you plan on having hardware accelerated X11 or Wayland, you need
the VC4 driver. You'll need "Desktop" OpenGL otherwise nothing will
work on a RPi system, which as of 2015 has over 5 million units
shipped. This is not an insignificant user base.
IMHO, the decision to switch away from 'Desktop' OpenGL to GLES was
the wrong decision and should be reversed until a solution is found to
support both.
