last time i've packaged vtk, I removed them (at least those that either
already had been packaged or easy to do so), in order to make sure that
nothing in that really complex cmake file can even try build/use any
piece of them.
the package was just meant for an inhouse installation for my client,
so i didn't care much about policies and orig tarball handling - I've
just patched directly in the git repo.
