Plan C: just stop supporting non-merged-/usr systems since these 
problems are caused by having to support both, and there is no real 
benefit in doing that other than pleasing the few people who are scared 
by changes.

If it takes 10 years then we will have to wait 10 years to deliver an 
enabling technology for important features.
Also, I seriously question that this would be practical: moving a binary 
requires coordination with all other packages using it, while the switch 
to a merged-/usr is transparent.
If you believe that a 10 years timeframe for a change is totally OK then 
you obviously do not care about it, so you what you are really arguing 
for is doing nothing.

There are no benefits from a merged-/usr scheme as long as there are 
system binaries outside of /usr.

It has been documented here long ago: https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge .

No, it's not the main reason. It's not even an interesting reason, it's 
just an example showing that this kind of setup has been tested for 
years and is nothing new.
You are misconstructing the arguments in favour of merged-/usr to be 
able to dismiss them easily.

WTF? Fedora is not relevant, it's RHEL that matters and it switched to 
a merged-/usr. If you are seriously claiming that RHEL is "fading into 
obscurity" then we obviously lack a common ground to discuss anything.

These are few examples of the features that a merged-/usr system 
enables. /etc and /var do not just get "out of sync", so your argument 
is wrong.
