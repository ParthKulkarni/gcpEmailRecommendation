  Description     : user-extensible heap manager for heterogeneous memory platforms
 The memkind library is a user extensible heap manager built on top of
 jemalloc which enables control of memory characteristics and a partitioning
 of the heap between kinds of memory.  While arbitrary user control is
 possible, built-in characteristics include NUMA and page size.
Note that there's an issue with a patched fork of jemalloc.  Version 1.7
(included in Ubuntu) can use unmodified jemalloc 5.1, 1.8 requires a patch
that hasn't been accepted by jemalloc's upstream.
But, unlike Ubuntu, Debian doesn't have jemalloc 5.1 anyway.  We're still
at an ancient version (3.6).  The rB-Deps include only 16 packages, but
most of them are both fat and notable.  Quite a bunch also FTBFS for
unrelated reasons; excluding those it seems spades is the only one that
breaks on upgrading jemalloc 3.6 -> 5.1.  As doing such a transition is
not a trivial task, I'm thus thinking of using the private fork of
jemalloc for memkind for the time being.
On the other hand, there are other projects needing such patched jemalloc,
such as redis.
