  Description     : Yet Another V4L2 Test Application
Warning, newbie here :)
Yavta is a simple but powerful to configure/test v4l2 devices. It is used,
among other things to verify embedded systems and to test timing issues.
I plan to maintain it on a git repository. I have already started it on:
https://github.com/ribalda/yavta But it can be moved anywhere.
It is a simple enough package to maintain it myself and hopefully, the first of
other  many others.
I found zumbi as sponsor, but it someone is interested I can add the package in
a team.
Thanks!
