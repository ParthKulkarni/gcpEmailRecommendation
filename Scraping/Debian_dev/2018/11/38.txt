  Description     : DNS server and recursor performance testing tools
 dnsperf is a DNS server performance testing tool. It is primarily intended
 for measuring the performance of authoritative DNS servers, but it can also
 be used for measuring caching server performance in a closed laboratory
 environment. For testing caching servers resolving against the live
 Internet, the resperf program is preferred.
Currently, there are no other packages providing dns performance testing tools.
Co-maintainers are welcome, but not needed.
I would need a sponsor.
A RFP for this software has already been filed[1], but has been archived due to inactivity.
