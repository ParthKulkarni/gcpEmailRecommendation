My main desktop is now an arm64 machine with an nvidia PCI graphics
card. These are fairly new (and currently expensive), but I have
reason to believe there is more of this sort of thing coming, and
laptop-format machines.
I need to investigate this further, but changing from GL to GLES just
at the moment where desktop hardware starts to make inroads could be a
big own goal on arm64. I recall Linaro doing some work on this back
when it started (to make it easier to switch between GL and
GLES). Possibly that work never actually got done, just talked out.
