Again, how many weren't systems you're responsible for? I have no doubt

users is a debian developer; sometimes other people solve problems in a 
way that we didn't really expect or plan for them to.
"We ran into some unanticipated issues when we usrmerged our build 
systems, and we think the way to fix that is to force merge every one of 
our users' systems."
