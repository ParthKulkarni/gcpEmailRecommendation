That's because our Debian maintainers are not hasty at packaging new drivers
with such "improvements".  The support for your card's generation and the
next (400 and 500) is long since dropped in nVidia's mainline.
A glance at upstream's site discouraged me from searching for information
when _they_ dropped it, but in Debian, the droppage reached experimental in
April 2018.
So -- my figure of 3 years was exaggerated, but so is your defense.
I guess the Debian packages will once again fork the old drivers, but at
least upstream security support for them ends Jan 2019, which for something
that requires a kernel driver is deeply troubling.
And, it means no porting to new kernels -- nearly at all, as opposed to
supported cards being "only" 0-3 months behind a stable release.  So sorry,
that's simply not an option for a good part of us.  As for nouveau, you
don't know if it actually works adequately for your card until you buy it.
Thus, Linus' message was neither strong nor expressive enough.
Meow!
