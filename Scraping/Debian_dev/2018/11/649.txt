I fully agree again.
Looking at the lengthy progress so far and the limited resources
available, I suggest supporting the development by switching to GLES and
work on the drivers to support that first. Once that has been achieved
we can aim for full OpenGL support and then we can switch back to
desktop if there is actual user demand. I'm not suggesting to make
Debian more friendly to proprietary drivers. The exact opposite:
switching to GLES to fill the void will give us time to aim for one
milestone at a time. The vast majority of devices we are talking about
are embedded systems, let's aim to bring them the drivers and interfaces
that have been designed for embedded systems before we reach for the stars.
A lot of the discussion in this thread seems off topic and academic but
Iâ€™m confident that the above approach is what we need to move on.
