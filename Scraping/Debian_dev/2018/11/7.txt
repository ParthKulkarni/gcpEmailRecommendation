You can extend this logic and claim itâ€™s fundamentally bad to help
people in need, since that is discrimination on the fact of being in
need. In other words, helping someone whoâ€™s in a worst position
because of been previously and currently being discriminated against,
while being sort of discriminative (e.g. helping that person and not
someone whoâ€™s not been discriminated against), it fundamentally a good
thing, as it helps people and brings things into balance.
Your logic is flawed, just accept it already.
