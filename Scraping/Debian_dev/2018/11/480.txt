We could also skip buster, hold usrmerge out of the buster release as a
not-yet-supported configuration (or ship it with a bunch of disclaimers; I
have no strong opinion either way), and then aim for the next release, and
in the meantime double down on trying to get as much testing of usrmerge
systems as possible.
That's going to be a disappointing delay for a lot of people, I'm sure,
but it's still better for them than never doing this at all.
