Because this requires providing two separate *stacks* of source packages,
one for GL and one for GLES, which from Ubuntu's experience doing this
previously for Ubuntu Touch, I can say is a non-trivial amount of
maintenance overhead.
There is some prior art here that I could provide pointers to if the Debian
Qt maintainers did decide to take this on, but best case is that you still
have two sets of about a half dozen source packages that have to be kept in
sync.

Long ago I heard rumors of development work on mesa that would allow it to
function as a proxy library, so that apps would link against libGL as needed
and the GL implementation would use a hardware-accelerated GLES driver where
possible, falling back to software GL where necessary.
Since we are still having this conversation about having to choose between
GL and GLES at compile time, I infer that this has not come to fruition.
