According to config_help.txt [1], Qt uses ES2 by default on Windows.
It probably means that it will work fine with most desktop video cards.
But as Lisandro says, such a change in Debian will break many packages
(which are currently broken on ARM only), so we are definitely not
considering it at this point.
