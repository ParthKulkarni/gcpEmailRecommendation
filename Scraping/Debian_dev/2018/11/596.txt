That's libqt5gui5:

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. libqt5gui5 is surely the second most 
used library provided by Qt just before libqt5core5.

As long as the human behind it has a way to simply trigger this rebuilds 
automatically. I think Ubuntu has by using launchpad. We in Debian don't 
(please prove me wrong!). On my current machine that would take 
approximately... a couple of months. Without using it for anything else.
Of course, if anyone feels like doing it... :-)
