Other Info
--------------
As requested, this is librsvg reintroduced for ports that don't
supported the rustified librsvg yet. The name is because this is
librsvg written in the C programming language (instead of in Rust).
Packaging can be found at https://salsa.debian.org/gnome-team/librsvg-c
Currently, the packaging builds the same binary package names as
src:librsvg. There was a suggestion to use different binary names with
versioned Provides (against the existing librsvg binary package
names). I'm not sure that provides much benefit but we can discuss
that.
I don't have the ability to do the initial upload for this package
since I don't have easy access to do the binary build required for
ftp-master NEW.
I don't have experience with archive management for non-release
architectures at all.
Thanks,
Jeremy Bicha
