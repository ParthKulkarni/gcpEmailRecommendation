  Description     : Type in your language with Keyman for Linux
 Install, uninstall and view information about Keyman keyboard
 packages.
 .
 This package depends on all that is needed for using Keyman
 for Linux.
-----
It produces 2 packages
keyman: scripts - km-config gui and some command line scripts
python3-keyman-config: python module
The package will be maintained in the Debian Input Method team.
These programs manage the keyboards to be used (for now) by ibus-kmfl
and (in development) ibus-keyman, and make them available for IBus.
The keyboards are available on https://keyman.com for a large
number of languages.
The current release, late alpha, is at https://downloads.keyman.com/linux/alpha/10.99.33/keyman_config-10.99.33.tar.gz
Thanks,
Daniel
