Noooooo!  This wasn't aimed to be a dig at you.  Asking you to change would
be "shaking the boat", which is precisely the thing we don't want. :)
It's social people who put nice forms of speech above actual merit, and
I'm for one anything but social.  What I want is for lists to be kept in a
good shape, a job that you're doing superbly.  You have (almost certainly
unconsciously) done some social engineering -- that, by sounding grumpy,
you reduce the number of people bothering you unnecessarily.  On the other
hand, had you been nice, people would flock for random unrelated minutiae
or even chit-chat.  That'd explode your load.  Thus, the very society that
touts nicety of speech actually punishes people who do that.
So, you want your list workload to not increase.  We want you to continue
doing good work.  Ie, you being grumpy is a good thing for Debian overall.
Meow!

beer's job, why not?
On the other hand, mass-produced lager is not a race.
