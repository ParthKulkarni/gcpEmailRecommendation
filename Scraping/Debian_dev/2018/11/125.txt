Assuming that packages is under the Salsa Debian namespace, then I
think that's what you (perhaps unknowingly :) signed up for when
adding a repo there. See the Collab-maint sections in:
  <https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/12/msg00003.html>
and
  <https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/Doc#Collaborative_Maintenance:_.22Debian.22_group>
Because, I'm not sure what's the point of hosting a git repo, on a
platform like gitlab with its trivial forking facilities, on a group
with wide write permissions, if you don't want others to directly
write to it? :)
Thanks,
