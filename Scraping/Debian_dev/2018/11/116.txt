This was discussed: you can attach multiple signatures to a UEFI binary
such as shim, so all this would need is to add an additional signature.
Maybe also a legacy version with only the MS signature in case some
implementations don't like multiple signatures (it was added in a later
UEFI version as far as I understand).

I agree.  You can probably always get something with a valid signature
and a code execution bug running...
