  Description     : Python library for the generation of email authentication headers
 Authheaders can generate both authentication results header fields and DKIM/
 ARC sighatures.  It can perform DKIM, SPF, and DMARC validation, and the
 results are packaged into a single Authentication-Results header.  It can
 also DKIM and ARC sign messages and output the corresponding signature
 headers fields.
It supports both python2.7 and python3 (tested with python3.6 and 3.7).
I intend to maintail it within the Debian Python Modules Team.
I am packaging this as a dependency for another project I expect to upload
relatively shortly.
