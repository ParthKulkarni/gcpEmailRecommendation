Hi! Please let me reply first to your last part:

No, I'm afraid there is no way to do that. We did consider it many times, but 
is definitely too much work to hack on.
So we need to force an architecture (actually, all of them!) to either one or 
the other.

- GPU architecture is not tied to the arch: right.
- Qt is tied to either Desktop or GLES: yes
So we need to pick one. The question is then which one will benefit our users 
most.
So far I personally know 0 people with an arm64 board with PCI slots, while I 
know many with arm64 boards with hardware GLES support.

No need to use sarcasm. Yes, it's a matter of choice. No one noted yet that 
all archs except armel and armhf have Desktop support and not GLES. And this 
is because, so far and to the best of our knowledge, that has been the right 
thing to do.
So: what's the best outcome for our *current* users? Again, pick only one.
