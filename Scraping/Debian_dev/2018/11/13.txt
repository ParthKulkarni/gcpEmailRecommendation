That's true, but it's not clear that the result would be different.
And while I have certainly no objection in going down that route,
I also don't plan to actively push into this direction given that the
current situation seems to be working relatively well. I don't want to
break what's working given the time and energy I already invested in this
project.
I know that Luca is not 100% satisfied with the current situation but
while I acknowledge his message, I have not much to propose. Last time
I tried to bring LTS even closer to Debian (in terms of getting LTS
sponsors thanked on www.debian.org, etc.), the discussions quickly stalled.
If anybody wants to drive a change in the way the LTS funding works, I
will be happy to participate in the discussion/project but it needs to be
well prepared because handling so many sponsors with all the
invoicing/payments quirks is a non-trivial amount of work and moving
away from Freexian to a trusted organization is going to be supplementary
work. The scheme has been designed so that it can fund itself (the share
that Freexian is taking funds that part of administrative work) so it's
possible and it should sustainable in the long run once the initial cost
of moving has been paid.
Cheers,
