I don't believe supporting legacy installs *without doing the migration*
is an option, or at least an option that we should take.  We could
theoretically make it work, but the ongoing burden to packagers and to
our testing infrastructure would be high.  It would be yet another obscure
and irritating thing that you'd have to mess with when packaging and that
was very hard to test, and we already have way too many of those.
So yes, this is exactly the decision before us.
