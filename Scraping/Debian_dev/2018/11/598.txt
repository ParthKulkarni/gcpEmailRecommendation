Or maybe even applications! Let's suppose libqt5qml5 follows the libexample 
example (it *does* requires some kind of OpenGL). Now qtcreator (to name just 
one application) does usage of it, and users will surely want to use the right 
build for their use case. Building two qtcreator binaries sounds like just too 
much.
Now get Plasma. It does a heavy usage of QML. In *lots* of places and 
packages.
At this point I really feel that, except I am missing something, double 
building is just not a good idea :-/
