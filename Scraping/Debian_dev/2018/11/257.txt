Hi,
The salt package has been broken in unstable for several month now
since python-tornado upgraded to version 5. salt needs major changes to
support tornado 5 (which uses asyncio) [1]. I have waited for upstream
to support tornado 5, but the tornado 5 support is still work in
progress and I lost the hope that it will land in the development
branch or a release in time for the buster freeze. I don't want to ship
salt with a big patch to support tornado 5 risking to introduce bugs.
Therefore I like to:
1) Create a python3-tornado4 package containing the latest tornado 4.x
release. This package would rename the tornado module to tornado4 to
make it co-installable with python3-tornado.
2) Patch salt to use python3-tornado4 instead of python3-tornado.
Once salt supports tornado 5, the patch and the python3-tornado4
package can be dropped.
What do you think? Any reasons against it or do you have a better idea?
