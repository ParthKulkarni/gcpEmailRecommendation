Hi,

But I want to take issue with this. RHEL is moderately-widely used,
because if you want to get RH support (e.g. for OpenStack) then you have
to be running RHEL. It's interesting to note what RHEL are up to, I'd
say, but I wouldn't go out of my way to be compatible with them - after
all, there's a reason we're .deb based not .rpm ;-)
I'd suggest we talk about the benefits or otherwise of /usr-merge and
leave RHEL out of it.
Regards,
Matthew
