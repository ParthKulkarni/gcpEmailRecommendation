Right, and the fact that they can conditionally compile differently with
OPENGL_ES doesn't necessarily mean they would need to be.  E.g. looking at
gammaray, it's not obvious to me that this should have two builds; it's
possible the code should instead be fixed to not need to make this
conditional at build-time, given that the package is binary-compatible with
Qt built with or without GLES.

I would caution against prematurely optimizing for build-time.  Yes,
building the entire source package twice is a waste of resources, but it's
probably a drop in the bucket.
The reason not to build the two stacks from a single source package is that
the gl vs gles libraries are by design drop-in replacements for one another
- i.e.: they must have the same soname in order for the symbols magic to
work, which means they end up conflicting on the system.  You *could* design
a system that allows them to be coinstallable via subdirectories and
manually-managed symlinks, but I doubt this is actually worth it in practice
for the number of packages affected.
