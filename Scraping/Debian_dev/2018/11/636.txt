Just so this doesn't sound like shoving all effort onto you: even if you
won't provide us with a ready answer on a golden platter, any research is so
much easier if we can start from some advice.  And it's so much better to be
aware of problems _before_ buying stuff.
And it sounds like problems there are.
Thus, knowing what can go bad would be nice for any reader of this list
who's about to look for a GPU.
Which was never a nice thing -- back in the days of Trident/SiS, today
with Mali on ARM or the usual culprits on x86...
Meow!
