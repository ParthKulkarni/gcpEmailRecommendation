There used to be a very brief effort around PowerVR devices but it
looks like that has died now. Some of the project site was captured by
archive.org and lkcl's part of the work is still on his site. If
anyone wants to start a new reverse engineering effort, I strongly
suggest to start it on a hosting service close to the existing
Xorg/etc communities that will last long-term (like
freedesktop.org/x.org) instead of one that might disappear at any
moment.
