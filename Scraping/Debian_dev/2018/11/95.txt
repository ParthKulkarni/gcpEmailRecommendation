  Programming Lang: C/Python
  Description     : Library containing various image processing algorithms.
Really simple C Library containing various image processing algorithms.
It includes Python 3 bindings designed to operate on Pillow images (PIL.Image).
The C library depends only on the libc.
The Python bindings depend only on Pillow.
APIs are designed to be as simple to use as possible. Default values are
provided for every parameters.
The library provides the following image processing algorithms:
Unpaper's algorithms (Blackfilter, Noisefilter, Blurfilter, Masks,
Grayfilter, Border), Canny edge detection, Sobel operator,
Gaussian blur, ACE (Automatic Color Equalization ; Parallelized implementation),
SWT (Stroke Width Transformation), Compare : Compare two images (grayscale)
and makes the pixels that are different really visible (red).
This package is a dependency of PaperWork[0] which I intend to package.
I wish to maintain it in salsa.d.o (a request for a repository should
follow in the next days).
As I'm not a DD, I will need a sponsor for this package.
