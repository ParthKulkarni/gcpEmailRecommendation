Documented - no.
The rationale was that the X stack on ARM64 in Ubuntu was enabled
specifically to support mobile, where, just like for armhf, the relevant
accelerated drivers that needed to be supported were GLES-only Android
drivers.
It was only on x86 that it was worth the extra effort to support dual Qt
stacks, and that was because the goldfish Android emulator only provided
accelerated GLES - we obviously weren't going to force GLES on all x86
desktop users in order to support goldfish, so that meant building both
variants.

Up to now there hasn't been sufficient justification for worrying in the
other direction about Ubuntu not having full GL support on arm64.  But since
Debian is contending with this question, I think the previous Ubuntu
dual-stack implementation is a solid solution and I would be happy if Ubuntu
dropped its delta on the Qt packages as a side-effect.
