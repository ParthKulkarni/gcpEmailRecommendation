I think printing errors like this in the postinst is unlikely to
attract the attention of users who such a warning might be targetted
at. Even for the extra-technical ones who do read their apt logs
judiciously (or have a script to do that for them), it also doesn't
fix the situation when folks are running Debian VMs in VirtualBox
running on other platforms.
So probably the VirtualBox UI should be indicating the lack of
VT-x/AMD-V and inducing users to reboot and turn that on in their boot
firmware.
