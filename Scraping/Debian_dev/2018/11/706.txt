The process would stay the same, just instead of uploading to unstable
during the freeze, we would upload to t-p-u.

Nothing would prevent one from uploading to both t-p-u and sid.
I very much support this proposal, but we're probably too close from the
freeze already, and this would probably also need some work on the
release team and/or FTP master side. If you want this to happen, maybe
you should get in touch with both teams directly and do the work *after*
buster is released? Anyway, they would tell...
