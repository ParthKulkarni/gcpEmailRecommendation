Do those exist? I thought Intel only made GPUs that are integrated into
their CPUs (the "HD Graphics" series). Presumably that's what you meant
when you said embedded?
As far as I understand it the usual PC terminology is that a GPU built
into your CPU (as seen in low-end or ultraportable laptops) is an
"integrated GPU", and a separate module like all(?) NVidia hardware or
most AMD hardware (in gaming/high-end laptops, or a PCIe card in desktops)
is a "discrete GPU". Some AMD CPUs have integrated AMD GPUs.

Recent AMD GPUs use the "amdgpu" kernel driver and its accompanying Mesa
user-space driver, which is an open source stack if you don't count the
GPU firmware. It should be comparable to the situation on Intel integrated
GPUs (but a lot faster and more featureful, and probably with more bugs,
because the hardware is faster and more featureful). Expect to need a
recent (buster/sid) kernel, particularly for newer hardware.
Old ATI/AMD GPUs can use the radeon driver stack, which is also open
source (except for firmware) and comparable to Intel integrated GPUs
(generally faster and more featureful for hardware of equivalent age).
I think there might be some intermediate models that are too new for
radeon but too old for amdgpu; if they exist, those will be stuck with
the proprietary fglrx driver, which as far as I can tell is like the
NVidia proprietary driver, but worse. fglrx is no longer supported by
Debian contrib/non-free.
