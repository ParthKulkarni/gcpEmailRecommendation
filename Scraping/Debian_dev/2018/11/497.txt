At least for the corner of the tech sector I've been spending time
in recently, it seems like persistent systems are becoming
increasingly rare and piecemeal package-based software distributions
in general are being abandoned (or at best becoming implementation
details in some image build automation). Pointing fingers at other
distros isn't productive behavior, and certainly isn't a way to keep
ours relevant. It's like fighting over the last slice of cake on a
sinking ship.
