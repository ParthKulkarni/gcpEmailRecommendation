People might frown on it, but other source packages (ab)use this, and it
certainly works from a technical standpoint. I would hope there are no
objections to this approach. However, kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386 are on
ftp-master and don't (yet) have rust, so those will also keep the source
package around.
