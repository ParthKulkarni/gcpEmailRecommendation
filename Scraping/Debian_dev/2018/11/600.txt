Ah, now I do get your point. That works as long as the difference between the 
Desktop GL/GLES builds are that the GLES build produces just less symbols and 
no new ones comparing to Desktop GL.
*But* there is also usr/include/<m-a>/qt5/QtGui/qtgui-config.h which differs.
According to codesearch.debian.net the affected non-Qt libraries packages are:
gst-plugins-good1.0
qtcreator
lyx
qbs
Of course all of this would need a check to see how they use it.

The number of source packages directly affected is around 20 (not counting the 
noes I mentioned before). Some of them are libraries like qwt, that can't 
simply be used with GLES. Some are applications that can be patched to build 
with either one or the other. And some are applications that will simply only 
work with Desktop GL.
We where in the process of determining those rdeps, but at this point I guess 
that if someone is interested in this approach should take it over. Of course, 
pretty please feel free to ask us in the team for pointers/help if needed.

I know concur that it *might* be possible, but:
- Double builds will need to be kept quite in sync. I remember Timo (DD/Ubuntu 
maintainer who worked on this on Ubuntu) stating that it was not easy. Of 
course, I don't know the details.
- Around 20 source packages (hopefully less) will fall in one of this 
categories:
  - Only usable with Desktop OpenGL
  - Will need a double build, sometimes with patches, or fall into the first 
category.
  - Packages are not limited to one team.
- Desktop OpenGL should probably be the default installation. Switching to 
GLES will probably need the user installing libraries by hand, maybe even 
reinstalling some libs/apps.
In my point of view it's too hacky. But then again, this is Debian: if someone 
wants to do the work and be ready to clean up if it fails then: welcomed.
