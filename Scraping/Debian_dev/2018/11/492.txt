Yes, that's much better than status quo.  Plenty of risks and unneeded
work, but it at least has a chance.  Supporting both is madness.

Uh... what "enabling technology", what "important features"?
Despite repeated requests, I have yet to hear a compelling reason.  All the
talk is about "how" not "why".
A cost-vs-benefits analysis is needed.

Well, can use a symlink if you really want to move a binary.  It could use
a common debhelper script.  But I have doubts even that makes much point.

If you want me to care about it, please explain what can I gain.

And those benefits would be...?
There's a reference to "system snapshotting" for which merged-/usr is
neither sufficient nor necessary.  I religiously use system snapshotting for
many years, without issues.

It talks a lot about "how" without a word "why".

Sure, please then provide a man not built of straw whom I can fight.

I am seriously claiming that RHEL is in the place Solaris was in 2010. 
Rapidly falling user share (like Solaris, it was ubiquitous in the past!),
acquired by a company known for wringing dry a small number of lucratious
customers -- just like Oracle.  This very scenario has repeated in the past
for a number of other Unices.  Some developers (including The Lennart)
already sound like they're mulling jumping ship <rumour warning>.
If going from 65% to 20% usage (including Fedora, CentOS and SLES) in the
only category we can reasonably measure isn't "serious", I don't know what
is.
But, we're not RHEL, we're not Fedora.  We're not even Devuan nor Ubuntu,
so there's no need to look at anything but: "will this benefit us? our
users?".

Ok, please tell us more about those features then.  "Why" not "how".
(But at least we both agree there's no way to support both merged and
unmerged -- so this flamewar already made a step forward.)
