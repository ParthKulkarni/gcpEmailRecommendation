this made me read the package description which reads/starts:
Description-en: set of advanced DWARF utilities
 This package contains tools that use the DWARF debugging information
 inserted in ELF binaries by the compiler. This information is already
 used by debuggers (e.g. GDB), and more recent tools such as systemtap.
I'd suggest you update this to

 inserted in ELF binaries by the compiler. This information is used by
 debuggers (e.g. GDB), and other tools such as systemtap.
or some such.
