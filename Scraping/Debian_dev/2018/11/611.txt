Well, that's at very least an interesting data point. So yes, they exist, but 
they are new and expensive. Can I assume that this means most of our arm64 
users do not yet get to them?

That's *exactly* what I have been reading since I filled the bug I mentioned 
before in... 2015. So far all I could see are embedded boards.
But hey, we can change it now and always go back in the future if arm64 
motherboards become ubiquitous.

It would really help, indeed.
