Not yet, no although I think you can just buy one (Gigabyte
ThunderXstation) now. But Machiato-bin exists with working PCI and you
can buy one
(https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Marvell/MACCHIATOBin), and
nvidia-based hardware is available and supports GL (Jetson TX1)
(https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/NVIDIA/Jetson-TX1). There
is more hardware coming which will support GL, so it is definately not
as simple as 'available hardware is all GLES'. (Perhaps someone has
made a list in this long thread).

OK. It seems that this project was started, but not completed due to a
lack of interest at the time (2012) (people just started using GLES on
dev boards/phones). It's here: https://code.launchpad.net/glproxy
And here is the spec: https://wiki.linaro.org/WorkingGroups/Middleware/Graphics/Specs/1105/GLProxy
Perhaps it is worth resurrecting this project if it would let us
acheive the nirvana of runtime selection between GL and GLES, thus
making everyone happy.
Jammy Zhou <jammy.zhou@linaro.org> cc:ed can say how much was/wasn't done.
