Please don't, no, for multiple reasons.
First, various packages followed the widely offered advice of using
libpam-systemd as the correct package to depend on if you need systemd
services, as it incorporated the appropriate alternatives on
systemd-sysv and systemd-shim. So packages depending on libpam-systemd
may depend on more aspects of systemd than just the pam module.
Second, based on experiences with systemd-shim, I would expect that
elogind will likely be *mostly* compatible with systemd's services, but
not necessarily perfectly compatible, especially when it comes to
current features. Using a Provides would make it more difficult for
packages to handle such compatibility issues.
Please instead just continue providing a separate pam module, please
*conflict* with libpam-systemd to avoid having debugging adventures
involving one interfering with the other, and please work with packages
that depend on libpam-systemd to add appropriate alternatives like
libpam-systemd | libpam-elogind if and *only* if they work with both.
