...?  I don't see what not tolerating race discrimination has to do with
being against helping people.  Am I missing something?
Both helping people in need, and not promoting any race/etc over another are
pretty basic rules.  Both are important requirements for the society.  The
latter is not included (yet?) in any document of Debian proper (other for
depriving someone of the right to run a piece of software), but at least
DebConf's code of conduct says it clearly:
The following is a list of examples of behavior that is deemed highly
inappropriate and will not be tolerated at DebConf:
[...]
* unwarranted exclusion from conference or related events based on age,
  gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, religion;
So I don't understand why you disagree so strongly with my want to have
similar rule for Debian proper.

This paragraph, can't parse.

Can't argue with such a statement...
