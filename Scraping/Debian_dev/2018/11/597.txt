On a second thought: suppose a library libexample that uses the symbols as 
provided by the current libqt5gui5 (either with one or the other version) but 
does not exposes it's symbols. The end result will not make libexample's 
symbols change but will for sure it's internal usage of libqt5gui5. How can 
one differentiate libraries like libexample from other libraries that do use 
libqt5gui5 but not it's OpenGL stuff?
Maybe there is a way, but I sincerely do not know (other tan trial and error, 
of course).
