usrmerge cannot convert a system which has two different binaries (not 
symlinks) with the same name in {/usr,}/s?bin/, because it cannot know 
which one should be kept.
This condition does not happen on regular systems: only if somebody 
manually copied something to {/usr,}/s?bin/, which is not supposed to 
happen.
