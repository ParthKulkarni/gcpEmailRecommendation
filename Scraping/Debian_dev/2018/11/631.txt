Tested on an early bronze age i386 box with an "82915G/GV/910GL"; both
glxgears and es2gears_x11 work fine.  I don't think anyone is going to run a
modern desktop environment on a machine older than that.
But that's an Intel card -- with nVidia, stuff 3 years old gets dropped from
the official drivers while 2 years old doesn't get Linux support yet -- and
nouveau has problems on its own.
I don't have access to any non-embedded Intel cards so I can't test one in
an arm64 box with a PCIe slot. ;)  But despite apparent insanity of such an
idea, it might be actually the sanest option.
Not a clue about AMD stuff.
Meow!
