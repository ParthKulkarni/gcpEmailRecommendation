Support for such a configuration is actively bitrotting as we speak. 
Library dependencies of /bin and /sbin are no longer isolated in /lib; udev
will not reliably set up all devices without access to programs under /usr. 
Even if some derivative based on a recent Debian release has managed to keep
usr-on-separate-partition-without-initramfs working for their purposes, this
is not sensibly maintainable over the longer term, and the existence of such
a derivative should carry very little weight with Debian when deciding
whether to merge /usr.
Example: even *without* merged /usr, an entirely sensible course of action
for any maintainer of a Debian library package is to undo all special casing
of /lib vs. /usr/lib in their debian/rules (.so -dev symlinks vs. runtime
libraries, etc) and ship everything in /usr/lib, because the maintainer can
rely on /usr/lib always being available.

I don't agree that there's a social duty to consult downstreams that have
made self-evidently poor engineering decisions, before making a change that
will inconvenience them solely as a result of those same poor decisions.
I don't mean that I'm unsympathetic to downstreams in that situation, or
that I wouldn't want to help them; only that their plight /should not/ be an
obstacle to Debian doing the right thing.
