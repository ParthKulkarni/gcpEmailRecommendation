  Description     : Puppet acceptance testing harness
Beaker is a test harness focused on acceptance testing via
interactions between multiple (virtual) machines. It provides platform
abstraction between different Systems Under Test (SUTs), and it can
also be used as a virtual machine provisioner - setting up machines,
running any commands on those machines, and then exiting.
Beaker runs tests written in Ruby, and provides additional
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) methods. This gives you access to all
standard Ruby along with acceptance testing specific commands.
