Hi all
This email is a followup to this earlier issue:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/10/msg00044.html
The TL/DR is that unfortunately I could not organize any sort of
meeting of interested parties for th meeting (which is this week).
Fortunately based on the discussion other people are have something
going on, please get in contact with them if you would like to
participate.
I did however manage to write a quick blog post about the background
and use cases for shared libs and ABI stability which can be used as
background information and to get the discussion going. It is
available here:

(It does contain some inaccuracies, there is an errata at the end.)
Hope you find it useful,
