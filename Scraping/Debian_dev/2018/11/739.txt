  Description     : light-weight implementation of the Stream.Readable
and Stream.Writable
 Memory Streams JS is a light-weight implementation of the
Stream.Readable and
 Stream.Writable abstract classes from node.js. You can use the classes
 provided to store the result of reading and writing streams in memory. This
 can be useful when you need pipe your test output for later inspection
or to
 stream files from the web into memory without have to use temporary
files on
 disk.
 .
 Forked from https://github.com/paulja/memory-streams-js to be modified
so that
  .end() calls emit a finish event.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This package is required for node-istanbuljs
