Thanks, that's a good point because it brings up something that's
important to distinguish.
Freexian as a business seeks money from customers/investors specifically
to work on Debian LTS. The other LTS contributors that Ben mentioned may
not work for a company that specifically seeks funding for that purpose,
but who fund LTS work because it's considered valuable to their goals.
In the context of Wouter's objection, I think the former category of
company is what's important.
