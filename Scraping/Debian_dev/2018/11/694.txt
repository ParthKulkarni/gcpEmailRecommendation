Hi Mike et al.,

Just reviewing this in NEW and was briefly uneasy about a package with
this name entering the package namespace. For example, given:
  $ apt-get source src
… and that there are also many places in Debian where we would be
using nomenclature such as:
    src:src
… to refer to this package, this is obviously somewhat confusing out
of context. There would also be binary packages that would be called
"src" (!) which, less problematically, would exist alongside packages
such as "linux-source" and "uwsgi-src" etc.
Is there a prefix, suffix or even an alternative name that upstream
use to avoid this? If not, we may have to invent one here. Thoughts
welcome.
Regards,
