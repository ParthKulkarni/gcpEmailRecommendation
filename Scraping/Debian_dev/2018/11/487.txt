why do you think we need to decide it via TC or GR, without letting
whoever is responsible for the affected packages decide?
How is that any different (from a procedural POV) than say changing the
default gpg keylength?
(Or are you just forseeing that someone will want to go to the TC?)
As a user, I couldnt care less if usrmerge is enabled or not. 0 visible
differences. /bin is a link to /usr/bin, the sun still rises in the
morning.
Or what am I missing?
