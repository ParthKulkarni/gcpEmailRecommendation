Putting all KDE packages plus all other Qt-using packages into one 
monster source tarball for building them a second time sounds like
a nightmare impossible to maintain.
Like how would security updates of gst-plugins-good1.0 in stable work
when a second copy of it is in the monster tarball due to gstreamer1.0-qt5?
libqt5gui5 has > 1k rdeps, the sanest way forward for providing two 
different ABI versions of libqt5gui5 at the same time would be two
architectures for arm64.
And that is not a realistic option.
