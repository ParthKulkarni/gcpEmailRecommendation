"Depends". The change is only for software using some specific classes inside 
libqt5gui5. If your video card supports GLES (aka OpenGL ES) then you should 
be fine.
I *think* that most video cards support both GLES and Desktop OpenGL, but feel 
free to point me wrong.
Also I understand that if your video card does not supports GLES then 
software-based rendering might happen.
The real issue here is that *many* arm64 boards currently do not support 
Desktop OpenGL, but do support GLES.
Also applications using GLU[T] or glew will not be able to compile anymore on 
arm64. GLU[T] has not been ported to GLES, glew somehow differs in a type 
definition.

That would be ideal, but yes, it's currently a build-time selection.
