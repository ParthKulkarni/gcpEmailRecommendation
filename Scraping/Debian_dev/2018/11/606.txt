I've been talking to people about this awkward situation, and it seems
to me that to do this properly either we have a good translation layer
(GL->GLES, and probably GLES->Vulkan too in longer term) or we have
dual stacks available.
I think it's worth investing some effort in determining how practical
these routes are, and the above is something I think is within my
capabilities. I'm not overflowing with tuits, but I do think this is
important so I'm prepared to spend some cycles on it.
