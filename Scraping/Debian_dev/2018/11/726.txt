  Description     : lightweight Ruby library with very simple syntax for parallelization
A lightweight Ruby library with very simple syntax, making use of
Process.fork to execute code in parallel.
Many other Ruby libraries that simplify parallel execution support one
primary use case - crunching through a large queue of small, similar
tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible. This library primarily
supports the use case of executing a few larger and unrelated tasks in
parallel, automatically managing the stdout and passing return values
back to the main process.
This library was created to be used by Puppet's Beaker test framework
to enable parallel execution of some of the framework's tasks, and
allow users to execute code in parallel within their tests.
If you are looking for something that excels at executing a large
queue of tasks in parallel as efficiently as possible, you should take
a look at the parallel project.
This package is a dependency of puppet-beaker.
