The majority of arm64 devices are mobile/embedded, which cannot be said
about amd64.
Of course it is bad to break packages, but leaving arm64 users with
non-working Qt graphics is also not ideal. So we are trying to find a
compromise solution here.
We do not have a final list yet, but packages that may get broken will
likely belong to one of these two groups:
- Packages that build-depend on both qtbase5-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev:
  cgal, flightgear, fraqtive, kalgebra, kstars, ksudoku, kubrick, paraview,
  simplescreenrecorder, starpu, starpu-contrib, structure-synth, vtk6, vtk7
- Packages that build-depend on libqt5opengl5-desktop-dev:
  bino, deepin-movie-reborn, enki-aseba, fracplanet, fraqtive, freecad,
  krita, libconfig-model-dpkg-perl, mldemos, mm3d, openms, qwtplot3d,
  shelxle, soundscaperenderer, tetzle, virtualjaguar, vite, vtk7
This is not a final list yet, but should be enough to get an estimate.
