  Description     : incremental merge and rebase for git
Performs a merge between two branches incrementally. If conflicts are
encountered, figures out exactly which pairs of commits conflict, and
presents the user with one pairwise conflict at a time for resolution.
I recently discovered this useful tool and now use it for my day-to-day
work dealing with forks of large upstream projects. I intend to maintain
this as part of PAPT (which I've just found out is open to all DDs,
though out of courtesy I've still Cc'ed debian-python).
Regards,
James
