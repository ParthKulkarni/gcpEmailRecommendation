Maybe even simpler: Create the tag for your upload (e.g. gbp tag). 'git
push' that tag. 'git pull' the changes (which uses the merge machinery
in case of overlapping changes).
You then have a tag with the released package (it's not pointing to a
commit on master but nobody says it has to) and all the changes
integrated into master and the contributors changes will end up in the
next release without any "messy" history due to reverts.
