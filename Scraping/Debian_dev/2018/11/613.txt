I do understand that there would be a lot of effort required to support 
OGL and OGLES but
as you have already pointed out "you are doing this already" because OGL 
is provided for
all platforms except armel & armhf which have OGLES - that means you are 
already tracking
Having OGL & OGLES available on the same architecture would be setup 
involved in creating
Yes there are now twice as many resulting sets of binaries for this 
layer, but it is
reasonable to assume that functional test of each strand can be split 
across the testing
for all architectures (where not automated), so the increased workload 
again shouldn't
I have quite a lot of ARM boards (for the record I am neither an ARM or 
Lenaro
I have 2 arm64 motherboards - both have PCIe slots and no GPU built into 
the SoC
these are Both MiniITX form factor boards and are drop-in replacements 
for amd64 based
I have several armhf boards - these all have OpenGLES supporting GPUs on 
the SoC.
Only one of them has a (single) SATA interface, none of them have DIMM 
slots (instead
having between 512MB and 2GB LPDDR soldered to the board)Â  None of these 
are desktop
PC replacements - they are embedded systems (think tablet / mobile /

As of today there are considerably more 'mobile' arm devices.Â  I suspect 
that this
will continue because they are lower cost mass market products. Full 
'desktop' on
arm64 has felt very close for the last few years, but hardware isn't 
there just yet.
There are some quite big server SoCs out there, but the desktop & laptop 
world isn't
You can't pick one that is the real issue.Â  The class of machine is the 
closest
you will get for a dividing line - mobile devices are largely going to 
be OGLES,
whilst desktops will have the same GPUs found in amd64 based machines.Â  
If you
tells me that long term excluding OGL from the arm64 architecture would 
be the
wrong decision
