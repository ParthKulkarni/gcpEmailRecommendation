Most packages which are affected by this issue I've seen so far search
for the binaries in $PATH and encode the full path of the first find.
Since PATH is typically set to something like
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
the first find will be /usr/bin/sed on a merged-/usr system.
I suspect if you had a locally installed sed in /usr/local/bin, your
package would encode that as full path, i.e. would be misbuilt.
In the end it's a bug in your package which should be fixed there.
As Marco said, the obvious and simplest approach is to nail down the
paths during build to a path that is known to work everywhere, i.e. in
your case /bin/sed.
A more elaborate fix would be, to not use any hard-coded paths.
Such issues are tracked at [1]
See [2] as an example for such a fix using canonical paths during configure.
Afaik, Simon has asked the schroot maintainer to default to
non-merged-/usr for the time being and this change should have been
merged by now #913228.
That said we also now use reproducibe-builds.org to more systematically
find such issues, see #901473. Thanks a lot for that to all involved!
Short summary: Don't panic, the buildds will for the time being default
to non-merged-/usr but please do fix issues as #913982 properly by
either not hard-coding path at all or by pinning them to paths that are
known to work everywhere.
On the package tracker page, e.g. [3] in your case, you'll find a link
labelled "reproducibility". If your package fails to build reproducibly
and you find something like
	SED=/â€‹usr/â€‹bin/â€‹sed
in the diff, you'll know that your package is affected.
Regards,
Michael
