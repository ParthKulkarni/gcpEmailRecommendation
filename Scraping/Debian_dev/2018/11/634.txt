I installed an AMD RX550 based card last year.  It required updates to
the kernel, firmware, X driver, and Mesa, which are all available in
stretch-backports.

I'm not aware of any gap.  In fact, at the kernel level, there is some
overlap where the newest models supported by radeon are also supported
(on an opt-in basis) by amdgpu.
The proprietary AMD graphics stack now depends on the amdgpu kernel
driver rather than replacing it.
