module
 Handy for require extension authors that want reliable access to the 
default
 By the time your extension is loaded, the default extension may have 
already
 been replaced. This provides extensions functionally identical to the 
default
 ones, which you know you can access reliably, no matter what extensions 
have
 been installed previously.

 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
