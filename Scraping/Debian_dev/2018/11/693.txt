  Description     : Filters for Django REST Framework
An extension to Django REST framework and Django filter that makes it easy
to filter across relationships. Historically, this extension also provided
a number of additional features and fixes, however many of these have been 
merged back into django-filter
 
 
This package is needed for lava support in Debian (Lava is an
automated test system, developed by Linaro)
https://www.linaro.org/engineering/projects/lava/
I plan to maintain it within the debian python modules team.
There is a question about which version to package:
The last released version is 0.10.2.post0 which needs:
    **Python**: 2.7 or 3.3+
    **Django**: 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11
    **DRF**: 3.5, 3.6
	    
Debian testing has Python 3.6 (unstable 3.7), Django 1.11 and DRF 3.8.
That DRF 3.8 would appear to be a problem.
There is also a v1.0.0.dev0 of djangorestframework-filters which is not released yet, but is tagged,
so we could presumably upload that (I've packaged that as well). That
needs:
    **Python**: 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
    **Django**: 1.11, 2.0, 2.1b1
    **DRF**: 3.8
    **django-filter**: 2.0
		
Which fixes the DRF issue, by only v1.1.0 of django-filter is in debian unstable/testing.
Anyone know what the best thing to do here is?
