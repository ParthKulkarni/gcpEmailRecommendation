This is not going to happen for reasons that have been explained 
multiple times, even if everybody knows that if you are in the web 
hosting business you need old PHP versions (I still have servers around 
with PHP 3 and 4).
Ondrej is nice enough to publish packages for old PHP versions in his 
own archive, so you can use these like everybody does.
I use 5.6/7.1/7.2 and they all work very well.
