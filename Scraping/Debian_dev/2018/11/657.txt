Here I agree with Luke Kenneth Casson Leightonâ€™s opinion [1].
I think we should aim to provide the best possible experience with the free
software ecosystem. The experience with proprietary drivers should be the
second priority, if priority at all.

We should make it attractive for vendors to release their code under
a free software (DFSG) license. That way anyone would be able to hack on it
and add missing support for a different OpenGL variant, if needed.
That said, as Lisandro announced, we will be happy to make any decision
if there is either a consensus or a TC decision about it.
