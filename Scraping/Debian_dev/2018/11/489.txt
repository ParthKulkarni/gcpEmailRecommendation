Because we have no idea what packages are affected (possibly a lot).  It's
not just packages that ship files in /lib, /bin, and /sbin (although
that's already lots); it's every package that uses something in those
directories.
Personally, I think the chances of breakage are reasonably small and I
think Marco has already done a ton of work to try to find that breakage,
but it's a very sweeping, global change, which is what makes it
challenging.

If we can decide via consensus that no one objects to the goal and it's
just a matter of getting enough testing to make usrmerge essential (and
working out the timing for when we have enough testing), great.  Given the
general trend of the threads, I'm dubious we'll get there, but consider me
+1 for that position if it helps.
