Will "kind of" do. Read below.

My most sincere apologies if our timeframe do not fit yours.
Now, wrt the decision: clearly the situation is very complex, involving many 
different kinds of arm64 devices, drivers, libraries et all. People involved 
have different opinions. We so far have been the proxy between them, be it on 
bugs, IRC or whatever other channels our users have to contact us. We prefer 
not to be this proxy anymore (again, read below).
Besides we (Qt's team) have just learned that the Desktop/ES support is not 
tied to the hardware but to the driver. That's a particularly interesting 
point.
So:
To quote my original mail, the "Qt available for both Desktop and ES OpenGL 
flavours" point remains unchanged: if someone wants to make it happen [s]he 
must join the team and support it from the inside. Remember there are little 
chances for this to happen in time for Buster.
For the second point, "If no change is possible, keep arm64 with Desktop 
OpenGL support", we have this position: we will keep the status quo, deferring 
users who want GLES support to Ubuntu.
*But* we are open to change this for any arch (read it: support either one or 
the other technology) as long as the decision is taken by the technical 
committee. As I wrote before, we will keep the status quo, so if anyone is 
interested in any change feel free to contact the TC.
Regards, Lisandro.
