Would packaging Regal solve any of this?
https://github.com/p3/regal
It claims to implement OpenGL on top of OpenGL ES, but I don't know if 
it is complete enough or efficient enough to be useful in this context.
Would it also break packages that directly call OpenGL functions that 
are not in ES?  e.g. 3D applications that were initially created under 
OpenGL 1 and never completely moved away from the old fixed-function / 
immediate-mode interfaces.
I don't know how many of these there are: the one I know about 
(FlightGear) is already on your list because it also has a GLU 
dependency.  Trying to find them via codesearch (taking the intersection 
of packages matching "glBegin[^A-Z]|glLight|glFog" and 
"path:debian/control libqt|qtbase|qml-module") finds

but as some of these are available with a Qt dependency on armel/armhf, 
I suspect they include false positives that use GL1 only in 
optional/example code or contain an embedded copy of the OpenGL headers.
