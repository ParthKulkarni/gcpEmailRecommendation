  Description     : Input method engine for multiple languages using Keyman for IBus
 This package provides the Keyman input method engine for IBus. With this
 module, you can use Keyman keyboard layouts designed for Keyman 11.0 or
 earlier under the IBus platform.
-----------------
This will be maintained in the Debian Input Method team
This is different from ibus-kmfl. ibus-kmfl provides supports for existing
source keyboards up to version 6.0 with limited support for newer source
keyboards that don't use particular new syntax.
ibus-keyman will support the full range of desktop keyboard packages
on https://keyman.com which are already supported on Microsoft, Apple,
Android and web platforms for the next version 11.0
It is in alpha in git so will go into experimental to start with for
the ITP until it gets to beta in a few weeks, provided it isn't too close
to the freeze.
Thanks,
Daniel
