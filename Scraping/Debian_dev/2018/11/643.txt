I expect this also applies to any driver in (or soon to be in) mesa,
including freedreno (Qualcomm), panfrost (Mali), lima (Mali), Etnaviv
(Vivante), Tegra etc. Drivers only supporting GLES seems to be a
something that happens only with the proprietary drivers. I don't have
any ARM devices with GPUs to be able to test this though.
