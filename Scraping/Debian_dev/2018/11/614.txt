Please keep in mind that not only we (the Qt maintainers) should maintain two
sets of packages, but also maintainers of third party Qt libraries and
applications.
Even in Ubuntu where the core developers can upload any package, this setup
did not work fine (they tried to maintain twin -gles packages for x86 for the
Ubuntu touch port to these architectures).

Thanks, this information is useful!
I would still like to know if the upcoming arm64 desktop devices have any
problems working with OpenGL ES.
Anyway, the decision we are making now is not permanent, we can always
revisit it in a few years like we are now revisiting the decision to stick
with desktop OpenGL.
