  Description     : Autocrypt encryption for mail agents
muacrypt is a support tool for implementing Autocrypt Level 1 compliant
mail agents. Autocrypt state is kept in one or more accounts which
process and produce autocrypt headers from respective incoming and
outgoing e-mail. Each account is tied to a set of e-mail addresses,
specified as a regular expression. Functionality is exposed through a
command line tool muacrypt and a Python api obtained through import
muacrypt. There is an evolving plugin architecture which allows to add
and modify behaviour of muacrypt.
