Maybe we missed to properly explain the main point of this change: currently 
most arm64 boards are using software rasterization because their video cards 
do not support Desktop OpenGL. If we switch to GLES then most amr64 boards 
will be able to render using their video hardware, thus greatly improving 
speed to the point of being actually usable for some stuff.
I imagine (but would *love* hard data) that any PCI video card added to an 
arm64 machine will probably also support GLES, so they will still have use.
But one thing is for sure: it's not a decision in which everyone wins, so we 
are trying to make a decision on which *most* of our users wins.
