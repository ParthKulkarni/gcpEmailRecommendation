I am not sure that is correct.  I certainly don't agree...
There is no special case here.  If you have a video card in your ARM64
PC then it is likely the same video card that you have for an AMD64 PC -
i.e. it is an off the shelf PCIe card.
Now it is correct that there is a large number of ARM64 based SoC
solutions out there with an embedded GPU - these are aimed mainly at the
mobile market (but as the computational power in these SoCs increases we
are already seeing that is enough for a lot of peoples 'PC' needs)
I guess what I am trying to say here is the GPU architecture is NOT tied
to the CPU architecture.

So <sarcasm>
any PCI video card added to s/amr64/AMD64 machine will probably also
support GLES, so they will still have use.
OK that is true - lets enact this across ALL architectures, but I
suspect that there may be a bit of pushback from the AMD64 heavy graphic
users...

Agreed
Is there any possible way to support *BOTH* OpenGL / OpenGLES?  Mutually
exclusive from an install POV, but give the end user the choice which to
install?  Why should we have one Architecture forced down a path
different to another architecture?
