It is actually fairly easy to answer this question as well: simply identify
all the packages in the archive that depend on one of the known dual-stack
libraries, prepare dual stack packages that use the symbols file magic from
Ubuntu, rebuild all the reverse-dependencies, and identify all those
packages which are libraries and which end up with a dependency only on the
GL version of the package instead of a dependency on GL | GLES.
A fair amount of compile time required to do this analysis, but relatively
little human time.
If someone was interested in volunteering to ensure both GL and GLES were
supported by Qt, this is where I would suggest they start, in order to
accurately size the effort involved and know what they're signing up for.
