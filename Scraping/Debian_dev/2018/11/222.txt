I naturally had my own cases of "ungentlemanly behaviour", but I don't
think I would be that easy to trigger.  This may be arrogant of me, but
as a personal policy I try to always "keep my cool"â€”even if it did cause
me sudden lashes when I've been angered (luckily rareâ€¦).
To the point that many consider my behaviour as "too little emotional"
when it should have been, evenâ€¦

I find this quite amusing, helping me from getting bored :)
So yes, I naturally agree with this statement of yours.

I think this is a case of different "believes".
From my view, looking for psychological counselling is not a bad thing;
I surely appreciate if somebody can deal with their short-tempered
character by themselves, but asking for help for such matters doesn't
automatically classify one a "mentally unstable".
In this particular case, I think MW has too much grief coming from
whatever he experienced fourteen years ago (he admitted it!), and in my
humble opinion he should seek help in dealing with that resentment.
I also don't understand what you said about "blaming the victim": I
don't quite recognize a "victim" here, nor a particular conflict or
situation that could define a "victim".

I don't think any "strong feelings" in myself were stirred.
Perhaps my wording about the above "psychological counselling" could be
seen as a insulting by someone depending on their culture and personal
believes, but I don't see it as such myself.  I hope my explanation
above clears what could be a misunderstanding.

Thanks for your work as the DPL, as I think you also find yourself
overseeing similar situations way more often than you probably would
like...
