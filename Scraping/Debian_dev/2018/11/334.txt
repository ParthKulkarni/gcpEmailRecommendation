I think it's broken...
from irc:
< mapreri> I haven't checked, but I think the merged-usr variation is now
broken already.  Now that debootstrap in stretch-backports (which is the
version we use) defaults to merged-usr installing that special package won't
change anything.
Will need to investigate.

our pbuilder base.tgz's are recreated every 2 days. Also we've manually
triggered some packages with known usrmerge bugs...
