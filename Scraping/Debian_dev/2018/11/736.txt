  Description     : Python implementation of the Socket.IO realtime server
 This socketio was implemented to work with flask-socketio.
 It has these features:
   * Fully compatible with the Javascript, Swift, C++ and Java official
     Socket.IO clients, plus any third party clients that comply with the
     Socket.IO specification.
   * Compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.
   * Supports large number of clients even on modest hardware when used with
     an asynchronous server based on asyncio (sanic, aiohttp or tornado),
     eventlet or gevent. For development and testing, any WSGI compliant
     multi-threaded server can also be used.
   * Includes a WSGI middleware that integrates Socket.IO traffic with
     standard WSGI applications.
   * Broadcasting of messages to all connected clients, or to subsets of
     them assigned to "rooms".
   * Optional support for multiple servers, connected through a messaging
     queue such as Redis or RabbitMQ.
   * Send messages to clients from external processes, such as Celery workers
     or auxiliary scripts.
   * Event-based architecture implemented with decorators that hides the
     details of the protocol.
   * Support for HTTP long-polling and WebSocket transports.
   * Support for XHR2 and XHR browsers.
   * Support for text and binary messages.
   * Support for gzip and deflate HTTP compression.
   * Configurable CORS responses, to avoid cross-origin problems with
     browsers.
I am packaging this software because it is a dependency for flask-socketio,
and flask-socketio is a dependency to kytos, that it will package soon.
