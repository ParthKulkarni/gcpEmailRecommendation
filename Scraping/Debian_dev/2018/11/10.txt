Yes, but then there's the important matter of wording.
A hyptothetical "Extended Debian support by Freexian" is a product of
Freexian that just happens to use Debian infrastructure.
In contrast, a just as hypothetical "Extended Debian support by the ED
team (financially supported by Freexian)" is a product of Debian that
just happens to be supported by Freexian.
I would be fine with something along the lines of the latter, but not
the former.
(the exact wording that we end up deciding on may be different, but you
get the point).

I think that if we end up writing something which "assigns" LTS to
Freexian, then the possibility that some other company doing LTS work
diminishes. That is not something I want to see happening.

Yes, that'd definitely be necessary.
