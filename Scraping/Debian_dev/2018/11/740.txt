Hi,
 Just FYI, as RHEL8beta release note says(*) "Python 2.7 is available in
 the python2 package. However, Python 2 will have a shorter life cycle and
 its aim is to facilitate smoother transition to Python 3 for customers". 
 I'm not sure but if we would ship python2.7 in buster, it may be better
 to say such notes (at least LTS cycle), IMHO.
