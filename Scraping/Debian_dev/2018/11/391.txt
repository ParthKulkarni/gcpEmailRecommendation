We could catch some of it automatically by creating /dontuse/bin and 
/dontuse/usr/bin as symlinks to /bin and /usr/bin on all buildds (and 
the sbin equivalents, too), adding that first to the PATH, and 
auto-rejecting any package that has these strings in it. I understand 
that there will be lots of FTBFS from doing that, so it may or may not 
be a good idea, especially because this covers only "we won't catch the 
breakage" point, but not "we should not be doing that".
