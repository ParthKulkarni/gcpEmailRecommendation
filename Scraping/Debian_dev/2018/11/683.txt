I have filed an ITP [0] for the Mongo C++ Driver.  So far upstream has
not yet declared a stable ABI.  As a result, I intend to upload to
experimental.
I am curious if anyone has suggestions for naming the library package in
experimental in such a way that it handles the currently unstable ABI
and also leaves the way clear for a properly named library package once
the ABI stabilizes and it becomes appropriate to upload to unstable.
That said, upstream intends to declare a stable ABI in some months,
after which the ABI, SONAME, etc. will be managed sensibly.  The upload
to unstable will not happen until that has been fully sorted out.
Regards,
