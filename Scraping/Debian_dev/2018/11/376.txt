Ditto, I did the same with about 8 machines about two weeks ago  with no issues.
It feels to me that there are a lot of people just assuming issues
will happen without data to back it up.
With the reproducible builds testing for changes based on usrmerge vs
non-usrmerge builds now, I hope at least for the "how does changing
the build chroots affect compatibility of built packages" we'll have
reliable data soon.
(At the moment I don't actually see the upcoming doom - a few packages
broke, bugs were fixed, life goes on. If it turns out that we are not
able to cope with new bugs in time, we can always change decisions
later).
Cheers,
