Reading from #881333 you mean Gemini PDA. It comes with Mediatek X27,
featuring Mali-T880. The hardware is not OpenGL ES only .. the
propiertary driver is. Mesa-based panfrost driver should support both
OpenGL and OpenGL ES:

The open source driver is of course not ready... ...but neither is
Debian ES 2.0. In the long run, making the driver ready is time better
spent than time spent trying to make Debian more friendly to a class
of propiertary drivers.
