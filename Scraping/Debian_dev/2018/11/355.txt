            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I do note that there was a mismatch for this specific upload, ie:
  https://tracker.debian.org/news/946971/accepted-libnfs-200-1exp1-source-amd64-into-unstable-unstable/
â€¦ but what is the evidence for Lintian not seeing this? The
maintainer could have uploaded anyway and/or they had an old
version of Lintian, etc.
If you are wondering why it does not appear on:
  https://lintian.debian.org/tags/distribution-and-changes-mismatch.html
... that is because that requires the .changes file to be
around, whilst lintian.debian.org processes source packages (ie.
that particular webpage is pretty useless).
Best wishes,
