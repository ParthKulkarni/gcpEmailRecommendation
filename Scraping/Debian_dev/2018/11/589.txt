Apologies for using the RaspberryPi as my example of a 'mobile' class SoC.
IIRC the Pi was being used as the primary argument for switching away
from OpenGL to OpenGLES as this is selling in large volumes.  If the Pi
already supports OpenGL then the argument to move solely to OpenGLES is
reduced somewhat.
I will try OpenGL on a RPi this week (I normally run RPi headless so no
desktop installed).
