On some of them I also enjoy advantages of merged-/usr, like having

I agree with the argument in this thread that usrmerge should be either 
Essential or not in Buster at all. I have no Debian systems in 
production, but the company that I have a contract with has some Ubuntu 
systems, and we are considering (as in: there is a successful PoC) the 
use of OSTree for deployment of some production systems. OSTree folks 
recommend merged /usr, so I do install usrmerge in the LXC container 
that is being used as a "golden" tree for deployment. And it works quite 
well for us with just a few extra moves and symlinks, and extlinux as 
the boot loader (to work around removal of GRUB2-related files from the 
Debian package).
So: my opinion is that I would prefer usrmerge in Essential in Buster, 
for the benefit of people who use OSTree for deployment, and to reduce 
divergence between Debian and Ubuntu plans.
