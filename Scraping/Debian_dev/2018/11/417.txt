Given that one of my packages had a bug filed against it that was
caused by usrmerge, and while I *can* fix it, I am also getting a bit
skeptical about trying to rush the usrmerge for buster --- and
**definitely** if it is a mandatory merge.  I'd be OK usrmerge being
in buster so long as it has a big huge, fat warning of the form, "if
it breaks your system you get to keep both pieces".  So if things
break in usrmerge system on Buster, they would ***not*** be RC, at
least not for the next 3 months.
Post-buster, I agree doing a mandatory usrmerge transition makes
sense, and this should be done very early in the development cycle,
and not at the very end of the development cycle.

Agreed, completely.  If we leave usrmerge in buster as a "use at your
own risk", then the people who are the most passionate can try it on
their production systems.  That will hopefully give us more feedback,
which will significantely reduce risk for bullseye.
