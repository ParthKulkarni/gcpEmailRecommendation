Ah, this is interesting.
The amount of packages will probably be larger in the current sid,
but it should not be more than 20 packages.
Plus there are packages which are using QT_OPENGL_ES macro for conditional
compilation (as I mentioned in my previous mail), but there are also not many
of them:
gammaray
goldendict
gst-plugins-good1.0
kamoso
krita
leocad
openclonk
phonon-backend-gstreamer
qtav
qt-gstreamer
qtwebkit-opensource-src
qtwayland-opensource-src
qtcharts-opensource-src

I wonder if these can be new binaries in existing source packages, instead
of separate source packages. Otherwise we will have too much code duplication,
and also wasted time: for example, in qtbase-opensource-src, only src/gui
needs to be built twice, and there is no need to built other submodules twice.
We already have an example of double build inside the same source: on i386,
src/corelib is built twice, with and without sse2 support.
In any case, this task looks manageable. Maybe if I have time someday I will
take care of it, but in the meantime volunteers are welcome.
