  Description     : Mender over-the-air software updater client.
 Mender: over-the-air updater for embedded Linux devices Mender is an
 open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
 devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as
 well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.
 .
 Embedded product teams often end up creating homegrown updaters
 at the last minute due to the need to fix bugs in field-deployed
 devices. However, the most important requirement for an embedded update
 process is robustness, for example loss of power at any time should not
 brick a device. This creates a challenge given the time constraints to
 develop and maintain a homegrown updater.
 .
 Mender aims to address this challenge with a robust and easy to use
 updater for embedded Linux devices, which is open source and available
 to anyone.
 .
 Robustness is ensured with atomic image-based deployments using a dual
 A/B rootfs partition layout. This makes it always possible to roll
 back to a working state, even when losing power at any time during the
 update process.
 .
 Ease of use is addressed with an intuitive UI, comprehensive documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/), a meta layer for the Yocto Project
 (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender) for easy integration
 into existing environments, and high quality software (see the test
 coverage badge).
 .
 This repository contains the Mender client updater, which can be run in
 standalone mode (manually triggered through its command line interface)
 or managed mode (connected to the Mender server).
 .
 Mender not only provides the client-side updater, but also the backend and
 UI for managing deployments as open source. The Mender server is designed
 as a microservices architecture and comprises several repositories.
 .
 Mender logo Getting started To start using Mender, we recommend that
 you begin with the Getting started section in the Mender documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/).
 .
 In order to support rollback, the Mender client depends on integration
 with U-Boot and the partition layout. It is therefore most easily
 built as part of your Yocto Project image by using the meta layer for
 the Yocto Project (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender).
