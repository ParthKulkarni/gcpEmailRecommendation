There are also packages like qmmq or kdenlive that use 
Qt5Gui_OPENGL_IMPLEMENTATION for conditional compilation.[1]
ES/non-ES is in so many places part of the Qt API that I doubt this 
could be sorted out quickly.
Qt already supports runtime ES/non-ES in the same library build on 
Windows [2], something like that might also be doable for Linux if 
anyone (Linaro? Canonical?) with a real interest in that would work
on making it happen.
Some of the listed applications already set Qt::AA_UseOpenGLES or
Qt::AA_UseDesktopOpenGL for the Windows case, but there would surely
be additional application side fixes required after someone added
dynamic OpenGL selection also for Linux to Qt.
