On some of them I also enjoy advantages of merged-/usr, like having 
multiple containers share the same /usr.
I agree with the argument in this thread that usrmerge should be either 
Essential or not in Buster at all. I have no Debian systems in 
production, but the company that I have a contract with has some Ubuntu 
systems, and we are considering (as in: there is a successful PoC) the 
use of OSTree for deployment of some production systems. OSTree folks 
recommend merged /usr, so I do install usrmerge in the LXC container 
that is being used as a "golden" tree for deployment. And it works quite 
well for us with just a few extra moves and symlinks, and extlinux as 
the boot loader (to work around removal of GRUB2-related files from the 
Debian package).
So: my opinion is that I would prefer usrmerge in Essential in Buster, 
for the benefit of people who use OSTree for deployment, and to reduce 
divergence between Debian and Ubuntu plans.
Based on reading the other messages in this thread, I changed my 
opinion. The new opinion is that any of the following outcomes is OK, 
with no specific preference:
2. usrmerge available from somewhere for installation in Buster, but not 
installed on buildds, and dpkg-buildpackage should refuse to build 
anything if /usr is merged and the user does not say "please".
