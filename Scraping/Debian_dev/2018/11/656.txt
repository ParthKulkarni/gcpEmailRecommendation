Having worked on multiple ARM boards over the past 3 years,
I agree very strongly with Raphael.

As the person who opened #881333, I completely agree. I've been on vacation
the past 10 days and haven't had a opportunity to chime in.

I've had multiple concrete projects involving KDE, Qt and ARM over the past
few years, over multiple ARM platforms such as the ODROID C1, C2 and the
Pinebook. With my KDE hat on, we have a strong stake in having Plasma
perform decently well on these devices.

I concur here. It was correctly pointed out in another reply that by using
OpenGL we're specifically catering to software that doesn't support
GLES while making performance worse for mature applications that
do implement both OpenGL and GLES. The reality of the situation is that
the market currently favors GLES over GL on ARM SBC's, delivered with
proprietary blobs. I think a more pragmatic view of this reality would be to
deliver the best FOSS user experience that's possible with the proprietary
drivers while the open source drivers are being improved. To that extent,
by switching to GLES we improve the overall situation since OpenGL
applications can fall back to software rendering via mesa on platforms
where mesa does not support the GPU.

By choosing to build Qt with GLES on ARM64, we make Debian a more
attractive platform for vendors who'd like to target ARM64 boards.
