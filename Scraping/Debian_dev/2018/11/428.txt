To be very clear: I have no problem with this at all.

"Suitable for distribution to other systems" is rather a moveable
feast.  I absolutely agree if you mean formal publication as part of
some kind of release.
But I'm sure all of us have on occasion done ad-hoc builds and then
copied the .deb somewhere else to install it.  Indeed my own
experience is that during development I rarely use a chroot.  I think
someone should be able to build some software on their own computer
and give the binaries to a friend, without having to set up a chroot.
I also think that setting up a chroot should be made easier and that
more people should use chroots.  I don't think these views conflict.

Would it be helpful to make some of this explicit in Debian policy ?
IMO binary packages shipped by Debian should certainly support
installation on both merged-usr and separate-usr systems.
And I wouldn't object to a rule that our source packages must build
`correctly' on both such systems, subject to the caveat that the
results from a merged-usr build are not of general applicability and
should be used only in a closed environment where all the target
systems are also merged-usr.
Does that make sense ?
Ian.
