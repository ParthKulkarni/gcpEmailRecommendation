  Description     : auto-save buffers, based on your activity
This package provides Emacs mode that auto-saves your buffers, when
certain events happen - e.g. you switch between buffers, an Emacs frame
loses focus, etc. One can think of it as both something that augments
and replaces the standard auto-save-mode.
