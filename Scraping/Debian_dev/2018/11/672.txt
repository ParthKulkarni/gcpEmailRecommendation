  Description     : desktop icon support for GNOME shell
This package provides a GNOME Shell extension for showing the contents
of ~/Desktop on the desktop of the Shell. Common file management
operations such as launching, copy/paste, rename and deleting are
supported.
This is replacing functionality that was in Nautilus prior to 3.28. It
uses D-Bus APIs provided by Nautilus to implement some of the features
mentioned above.
The GNOME team will maintain this package. I'll initially upload to
experimental, probably at least until there is a stable release as
opposed to a release candidate.
