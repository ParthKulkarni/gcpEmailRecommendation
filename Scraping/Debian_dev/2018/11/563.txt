Correct. After this switch, Qt on arm64 will be forced into embedded mode when it comes to graphics.
Not sure whether it’s the right decision to be made. Might be an idea to ask more users on their opinions on this issue.
Granted, I don’t really know what the real world distribution of embedded and desktop/server/laptop devices of arm64 is.  But I could imagine that there will be more arm64 devices in the future which are desktops, servers or laptops.
