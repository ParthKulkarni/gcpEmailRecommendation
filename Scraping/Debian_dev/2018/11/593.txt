Hmm, so I'm not sure this reflects the actual state of the art wrt dual Qt
stacks as it existed in Ubuntu at the time Ubuntu Touch was sunsetted.
Yes, GL vs. GLES impacts the ABI of libqt5gui5; HOWEVER, the set of
reverse-dependencies that are actually impacted by the GL-specific ABI
difference is actually quite small; and by using clever symbols files, the
impact on the dependency tree can be minimized.
If anyone wants to dig into this further, perhaps for proof-of-concept, here
is packaging that could be used as a starting point for the symbols files:
  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qtbase-opensource-src-gles/5.7.1+dfsg-2ubuntu4~1
And here is the list of all packages that required dual-stack at least as of
2017, when Ubuntu stopped development on this:
$ wget -O - -q http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/zesty/universe/source/Sources.gz \
    zcat | grep-dctrl -FPackage -r qt.*gles -sPackage
Package: qt3d-opensource-src-gles
Package: qtbase-opensource-src-gles
Package: qtdeclarative-opensource-src-gles
Package: qtlocation-opensource-src-gles
Package: qtmir-gles
Package: qtmultimedia-opensource-src-gles
Package: qtubuntu-gles
$
i.e. 7 source packages total, and 2 of them Ubuntu-Touch-specific (qtmir,
qtubuntu).
Maybe you were already aware of this, but it didn't come across to me in
your mail, sorry.  If you still think it is too much maintenance overhead to
provide a dual stack for these 5 libraries (plus any others that later start
to use GL-dependant ABIs), I think you're absolutely entitled to that view.
