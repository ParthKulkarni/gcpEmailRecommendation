Wikipedia says Intel GPUs support OpenGL ES 2 since gen3 (~2004)[0] or 
gen4 (~2006)[1] (yes, this is inconsistent), and Nvidia GPUs since NV40 
(~2004)[1] (they don't specify whether this is with Nouveau or 
closed-source Nvidia).  They don't obviously say for ATI/AMD, but the 
Mesa source code says[3] that "all Gallium drivers" (which appear[4][5] 
to include Intel from i915 = ~2004, Nouveau from nv30 = ~2003 and 
ATI/AMD from r300 = ~2002) support GL_ARB_ES2_compatibility.
On my system (Intel gen7, stretch kwin-wayland), both correctly display 
their main animation.  es2gears_x11 has a window frame and responds to 
Esc, but es2gears_wayland doesn't: is that intended, a full-GL window 
manager not being able to add a frame to a GL ES window, or a bug 
somewhere else?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units ; 
this is based on the Mesa source code [2], though I don't actually know 
if GL_ARB_ES2_compatibility = "can create a full-GL context that 
includes the functionality of ES2 as extensions" implies 
GLX_EXT_create_context_es_profile = "can create a true ES2 context".
