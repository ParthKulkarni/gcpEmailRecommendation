You can find information about that on the pipeline readme[0].Â  The
default path is in the root of the repo, but it can be changed on the
project's setting.

How did you define the yaml? If you use the one on the example, it
should run on every pipeline. Maybe you should rebase the branches?

We decided that the provided example is the easiest way to run. On the
branches for other releases, ej. backports, you should modify the
`expand` key to build for a different debian release.
Another possibility is to create more than one build job on the yaml
file and use the `only`[1] keyword to filter the branches and have
different pipelines depending on the branch name. It would look
something like this:
```
[..]
build unstable:
Â Â Â  extends: .build-unstable
Â Â Â  except:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - /^stretch-.*$/
build stretch:
Â Â Â  extends: .build-stretch
Â Â Â  only:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - /^stretch-.*$/
```
This example is only illustrative. Using that, `build unstable` would
run on all the branches except those whose name starts with `stretch-`,
where `build stretch` will be triggered.
> In any case, thanks for the work done. It's really good.
Thanks!
Hope that helped,
