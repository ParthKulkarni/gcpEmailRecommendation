The possibility that your system will break? The current usrmerge 
package has no test mode, will bail with a partially-converted system if 
it runs into problems, and has no way to revert the process. A sysadmin 
putting the same file into /bin and /usr/bin will cause the process to 
abort. I've seen a heck of a lot of systems in the wild where someone 
copies a file all over the place because some stupid 3rd party software
requried it or told them it was a good idea or because they weren't 
quite sure what the problem was and maybe this would fix it. 
Historically debian has had a well-deserved reputation for very reliable 
upgrades--let's not mess this up for something with such ambiguous 
benefits as a forced usrmerge.
If there has been serious discussion of making this mandatory before 
now, I missed it.  https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge itself calls just 
*recommending* the process a future item.
