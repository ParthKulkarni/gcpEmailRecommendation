My mail concert was not build-time, but our (maintainersâ€™) time.
For any changes in normal packages (e.g. packaging new upstream releases),
we will need to carefully merge these changes into the -gles packages and
remove the bits that are not needed there.

Ah, I understand now â€” you mean that to build both variants of e.g. Qt 3D,
we will need to build-depend on both libqt5gui5 and libqt5gui5-gles, which are
not co-installable.
That is a valid reason for having two separate source packages.
However maybe it will be possible to build at least two variants of qtbase
from the same source, as thatâ€™s one ofthe most complicated Qt packages.
