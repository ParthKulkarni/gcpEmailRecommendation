I agree, hence let's do the switch and focus on developing free drivers.
I fully echo your sentiment and propose a practical approach to give the
best possible support to the developers whilst also providing something
real to the user. In awe of the efforts that have already gone into
these development activities - right now we don't have the drivers, thus
we lack both OpenGL & OpenGL ES support for the majority of the arm64
platforms and considering the hard work and time it has taken already, I
doubt that we will have stable full OpenGL support anytime soon.
Making the switch means that we can give the hardware the proprietary
support available right now, develop GLES support, roll it out, extend
it to full OpenGL support and once that is reasonably mature switch back
to desktop.
