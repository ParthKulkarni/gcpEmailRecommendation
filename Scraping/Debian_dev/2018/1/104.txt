The output of ls on a terminal has never, in general, been an accurate
reflection of the contents of a directory.  Consider that filenames can
contain *any* byte value other than '\0' or '/', so including carriage
return, newline, backspace and escape characters.
ls also uses multiple columns by default, but without quoting you can't
generally tell where the columns are, e.g. is:
aa  ba  ca
ab  bb  cb
a list of 6 two-letter filenames, or 2 filenames with spaces in, or
something else again?

It is shell-safe.  No $-expansion is done within single-quoted text.

I think that the behaviour of single-quoting is very consistent across
shells, in part because it is specified by POSIX.

Be careful what you wish for.  But I think this will revert the recent
change:
    alias ls='ls --literal'
and this will disable all transformation of filenames (the same as if
output is not sent to a terminal):
    alias ls='ls --literal --color=never --show-control-chars -1'
