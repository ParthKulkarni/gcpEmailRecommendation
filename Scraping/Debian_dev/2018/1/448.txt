  Description     : deferred subroutine syntax for futures
Future::AsyncAwait provides syntax for deferring and resuming subroutines
while waiting for Futures to complete. This syntax aims to make code that
performs asynchronous operations using futures look neater and more
expressive than simply using then chaining and other techniques on the
futures themselves. It is also a similar syntax used by a number of other
languages; notably C# 5, EcmaScript 6, Python 3, and lately even Rust is
considering adding it.
The new syntax takes the form of two new keywords, async and await.
WARNING: The actual semantics in this module are in an early state of
implementation. Some things will randomly break. While it seems stable enough
for small-scale development and experimental testing, don't expect to be able
to use this module reliably in production yet.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
