  Description     : LAVA XML-RPC command line interface
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating systems onto
 physical and virtual hardware for running tests. Tests can be simple boot
 testing, bootloader testing and system level testing, although extra hardware
 may be required for some system tests. Results are tracked over time and data
 can be exported for further analysis.
 This package provides a user space command line interface to any LAVA (Linaro
 Automated Validation Architecture) instance for submitting test jobs or
 querying the instance for device and job status over XML-RPC. A user account
 on the instance is needed to create and use authentication tokens for some
 calls. The list of calls supported is described on the API section of the LAVA
 instance.
 This package is a replacement for the previously available lava-tool package
 which will be obsoleted shortly and the LAVA team will maintain lavacli as the
 official command line interface for LAVA. I am one of the upstream maintainers
 of LAVA project available in Debian. I would like to package the latest
 version (0.7) of lavacli. I would like to maintain this package along with the
 "Debian LAVA team" members, who already agree the need for lavacli package in
 Debian.
