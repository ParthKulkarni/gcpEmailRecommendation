Someone who was interested could get part way to this by running builds
with an empty equivs package which satisfied the build-dependency.
That could help give the involved parties (which does not include me) an
idea of whether implementing such a feature was a worthwhile expenditure
of their energy.

He no longer wished to be dead. At the same time, it cannot be said
that he was glad to be alive. But at least he did not resent it. He
was alive, and the stubbornness of this fact had little by little
begun to fascinate him -- as if he had managed to outlive himself, as
if he were somehow living a posthumous life.
