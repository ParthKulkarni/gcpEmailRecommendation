I don't see how you can say in the first a package complying with the
previous policy will likely comply with the current one and at the same
time saying that always complying with the latest policy is too much
work.
Moreover, if a package violates a MUST of the policy, just having an outdated
Standards-Version doesn't exempt it from getting a serious bug.
