I wonder how many of this ~80% is only due to having installed apt-utils
(99.83%) for apt-extracttemplates (which is responsible for having many
debconf questions before the installation process starts).
Anyway, the only util in apt-utils making use of libdb is apt-ftparchive
which a) isn't used much in Debian â€“ but by some derivativesÂ¹ and b) can
operate without the backing of a db, but you don't want to run a large
archive without it.
Famous last words, but I doubt there is anything libdb does for
ftparchive which couldn't be done by any other database, so switching
shouldn't be too hard database-wiseâ€¦
Finding someone performing the daunting task of actually switching code,
documentation and existing databases over on the other handâ€¦ I at least
don't see me enthusiastically raising my arm crying "let me, let me, â€¦".

everyone in the census. The biggest fish might be launchpad/Ubuntu.
