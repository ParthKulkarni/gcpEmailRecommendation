So that when someone does have a chance to update the package, they know
where to start from when reading the upgrading checklist.

Most changes to Policy are not serious bugs.  We try to avoid that sort of
disruption.  Most of the changes are incremental, and can be batched for
when you have time.  It doesn't particularly matter when you switch URLs
to https or add upstream signing keys for verification.
If you don't have a lot of time for Debian and are trying to keep packages
updated with new upstream releases, I think there's some merit to doing
regular uploads of new upstream packages while only checking Lintian
errors, and then once per release cycle do a standards version update and
deeper Lintian run with warnings and even info tags.  That keeps the
package decrufted, while batching the work a little rather than feeling
obligated to do it on every upload.
