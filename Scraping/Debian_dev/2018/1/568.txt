  Description     : macro to simulate user input non-interactively
This package provides an Emacs Lisp macro, `with-simulated-input', which
evaluates one or more forms while simulating a sequence of input events
for those forms to read. The result is the same as if you had evaluated
the forms and then manually typed in the same input. This macro is
useful for non-interactive testing of normally interactive commands and
functions, such as `completing-read'.
