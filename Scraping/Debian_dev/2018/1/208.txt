Who would then implement, maintain and support this in all packages?
Implementing that global flags like
  USE="-systemd -alsa -pulseaudio -wayland"
work across all 30k source packages would be a huge amount of work.
And then supporting that any combination of disabling/enabling various 
flags builds and works for all packages at the quality level people 
expect from a Debian stable - that's completely out of scope of what 
Debian could achieve with its already stretched developer resources.
