  Description     : The asap function executes a task as soon as
possible but not before it returns,
  waiting only for the completion of the current event and previously
scheduled tasks.
 .
 ASAP strives to schedule events to occur before yielding for IO,
reflow, or redrawing.
 ASAP provides a fast event queue that will execute tasks until it is
empty before yielding to the JavaScript engine's underlying event-loop.
When a task gets added to a previously
 empty event queue, ASAP schedules a flush event, preferring for that
event to occur before the JavaScript engine has an opportunity to
perform IO tasks or rendering, thus
 making the first task and subsequent tasks semantically
indistinguishable. ASAP uses a variety of techniques to preserve this
invariant on different versions of browsers and Node.js.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
