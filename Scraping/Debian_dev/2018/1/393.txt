  Description     : browser library for connecting to Shiny Server
 This Node.js package provides unified client code for Shiny Server, Shiny Server
 Pro, and RStudio Connect. Previously, each server product had its own version of
 this code with slight differences. This package provides the superset of
 functionality needed by the different products, and runtime options determine
 what features to enable.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This package is a dependency of shiny-server (which will be maintained by
Debian-science). I intend to maintain the package under the Debian Science
umbrella. I'll need a sponsor to upload the package.
