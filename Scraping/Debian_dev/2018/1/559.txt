  Description     : Data harmonization toolset for Earth Observation formats
HARP is a toolset for ingesting, processing and inter-comparing satellite or
model data against correlative data. The toolset is composed of a set of
command line tools, a C library of analysis functions, and import/export
interfaces for Python, Matlab, and IDL. The main goal of HARP is to assist
in the inter-comparison of data sets. By appropriatelty chaining calls to
the HARP command line tools one can preprocess satellite, model, and/or
correlative data such that two datasets that need to be compared end up
having the same temporal/spatial grid, same data format/structure, and same
physical unit.
