I don't really care about a bit of dead weight except on very small
embedded systems, of which I have precisely one left.
The build profile is useful where upstream source can be configured in
different ways, e.g. because someone wrote a daemon that works on BSD
and can optionally activate "systemd mode" with additional integration
code. There is still a large free software movement outside the
Linux+systemd world, after all.
My expectation at this point is "if it has a 'nosystemd' profile, then
at least it has probably been tested to work without systemd." Keep in
mind we just had a discussion last week if it was truly a bug if a
package fails to work if systemd is not present.
For that alone, the build profile is useful.
