Isn't this rather publicly announced by the how-can-i-help program? I
am running apt, and after each apt run I get a little report for
how-can-i-help if some of my installed packages are orphaned or in risk
of being removed.
I don't know if this isn't the case if you are using apt-get or
aptitude though.
