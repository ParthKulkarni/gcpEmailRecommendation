It's relevant to downstream distros that exclude systemd. I assume
such things exist. And we do our best to support downstream changes
that are integrateable, which is why we have things like dpkg-vendor
and ubuntu-patches. In this case a profile probably does make sense
becuse dpkg-vendor (nominally a more appropriate mechanism) can only
adjust build-time actions, not build-dependencies, and in this case I
expect that build-dependencies need to be changed. 
So no this isn't relevant to debian the distro, but it is relevant the
Debian the ecosystem.
