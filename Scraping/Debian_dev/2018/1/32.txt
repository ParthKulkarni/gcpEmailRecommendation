This would just be a question of turning down the warning for
"old-standards-version" to an info.  We have a separate warning
(ancient-standards-version) that triggers when your S-V is (currently) 2
years behind.
IOW, trivially doable in lintian, please file a bug if you want this.

Lintian's architecture does not lend itself to doing this atm.  If you
want this behaviour, then I suspect you will have to invest some patches
in it.
That said, it would be a good start to add S-V to many the lintian tags,
so people can see which S-V they apply to.
  (You may be tempted to just apply a filter on the S-V; unfortunately
some tags will change iteratively between policy versions, so you would
end up hiding a tag that applies to the old S-V because policy required
a tweak of it - or not hiding a tag when you should; anyway, I digress)
Thanks,
