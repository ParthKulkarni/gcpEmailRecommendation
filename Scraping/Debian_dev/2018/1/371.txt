  Description     : Convert MiniSEED time series data to SAC
SAC and MiniSEED are two commonly used formats for seismic data [1,2].
mseed2sac converts MiniSEED waveform data to SAC format. The output SAC
file can be either ASCII or binary (either byte-order), the default is
binary with the same byte-order as the host computer. By default all
aspects of the input files are automatically detected.
This utility is part of the standard toolbox of the seismologist.  I'm
going to file an ITP for the utility that does the opposite conversion:
sac2mseed.
I'd like to maintain this package within the debian-science team.
Co-maintainership is welcome.
The repository is currently on salsa:
https://salsa.debian.org/paride-guest/mseed2sac
and the packaging workflow follows what is suggested by the
git-buildpackage documentation.
