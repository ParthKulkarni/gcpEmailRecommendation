Probably, though IMO if your sentence can in some degree be socially
correct (aren't we all tired of those fanatics?), it may also be
technically irrelevant. I still feel it's probably a sensitive thing to

would probably make sense for those buildd to always select the
nosystemd profile when building, which would make life easier.
