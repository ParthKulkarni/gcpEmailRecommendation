I think there is only one distribution which wants builds without
libsystemd: the one that formed around MikeeUSA's call to action.
What does Debian gain from supporting a distribution whose developers
are unfriendly to Debian developers (accusing Debian to "vandalize"
open source by supporting systemd) and other people (calling a systemd
developer a cancer)?
Let me quote Devuan's IRC's infobot fact:
| 'sth is poettering' means it acts invasive, possessive, destructive,
| and generally in an egocentric exacerbating negative way. ``this
| cancer is extremely poettering'', [...]
I don't think we should waste time to accomodate the needs of such
people.
