Did you see the other thread that Adrian Bunk and I were participating
about viable paths forward?
What you're seeing is a project which is quite patient with, and willing
to support, ways to maintain a viable sysvinit infrastructure, or some
replacement with a similar design goal but updated software that solves
some of the newer problems.  But a project that is extremely *impatient*
with grandstanding nonsense that does nothing to achieve these goals and
is just a troll to waste our time, energy, and good will, like trying to
eliminate an inert shared library dependency or relitigate Debian's
default init system discussion.
Yes, this does require some navigation, and there are still raw feelings,
so picking a few people to do some of the social debates who are
reasonably good at it might be a good move.  But you can maintain plenty
of packages in Debian without participating in these debian-devel
discussions at all, and I can assure you that Debian Policy is quite open
to continuing to document and standardize how to build a sysvinit or
similar infrastructure.  There just need to be people to do the actual
work, of course.
It would also be nice if these folks would show a bit of basic politeness
and say thank you to the systemd maintainers, who have been a big part of
keeping an ecosystem alive in Debian that they don't even use, in the face
of a bunch of vitriol, just because it's the right thing to do.
