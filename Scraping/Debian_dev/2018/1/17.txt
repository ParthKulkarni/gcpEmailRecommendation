I never do that and I don't intend to do that in the future. Packaging
is already too much time-consuming. My assumption is that I know the
policy good enough to just follow the latest version. When packaging for
the first time, I won't re-read all the policy either.
Other answers agree with you, but I believe people not reviewing the
checklist won't just tell it here since they may not like being shamed
or doctored (not my case, don't worry).

Doing it at each new upstream version gives me a little motivation to do
it on the spot since I get a new upstream version packaged in the
process. No way I'll get the motivation to do batch of dozens of
package. But since I understand this is acceptable to just ignore
Lintian warnings and to keep the policy version untouched, I am also
fine with this solution.
