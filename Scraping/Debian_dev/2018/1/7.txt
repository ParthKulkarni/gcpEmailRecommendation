A lot of the time, you can just detect it, exit and leave restarting to
the init system, assuming your init system supports this.  Â«Don't ever
dieÂ» is only the rule if the init system lacks that support.
(Yes, there are cases where you need to handle errors more gracefully,
but having the option of Â«on error: exitÂ» is useful, especially for
simplistic control loops.)
