  Description     : Computer Monitoring and Classroom Management Software
 Veyon is a free and Open Source software for computer monitoring and
 classroom management supporting Windows and Linux. It enables teachers
 to view and control computer labs and interact with students. Veyon is
 available in different languages and provides lots of useful features:
    - see what's going on in computer labs in overview mode and take screenshots
    - remote control computers to support and help users
    - broadcast teacher's screen to students in realtime by using demo mode (either
      in fullscreen or in a window)
    - lock workstations for attracting attention to teacher
    - send text messages to students
    - powering on/off and rebooting computers remote
    - remote logoff and remote execution of arbitrary commands/scripts
    - home schooling - Veyon's network technology is not restricted to a subnet
      and therefore students at home can join lessons via VPN connections just
      by installing the Veyon service
 .
 Veyon is Tobias Doerffel's continuation of iTALC. The iTALC author asked
 me to replace italc by Veyon in Debian, which I plan to do.
 .
 Saying this, iTALC has become unmaintained upstream due to this switch
 and name change.
