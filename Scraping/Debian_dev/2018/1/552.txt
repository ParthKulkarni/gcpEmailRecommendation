Package: wnpp
I'd like to drop maintenance of doxygen. I think I hijacked that package in 2004
to be able to build the libstdc++ docs from the GCC sources. Now that the
package needs a concise understanding about the javascript issues (sources,
different upstream versions), I'd like to stay off that maintenance task. Helmut
Grohne has been a substantial help with the javascript issues, but decided to
leave co-maintainership.  Basically I'm asking for a new maintainer with the
understanding of the javascript issues, the implications for Debian policy, and
the willingness to adopt the package to build documentation of Debian packages.
Thanks, Matthias
