Again, libsystemd parallels libselinux and libapparmor. Software that
is portable to non-Linux kernels has to support being built without
those libraries because on non-Linux kernels they simply don't exist.
That isn't a particularly compelling reason to not link them (or introduce
new complexity to make it optional to link them) when building
Linux binaries for a general-purpose distribution like Debian.
In some ways it would be conceptually cleaner to
hard-depend on an implementation of the libsystemd
API at compile-time, substituting something like
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/md/libsystemd-dummy.git on the
non-Linux kernels; but I recognise that taking that approach doesn't
scale particularly well, and I don't think it's really sensible to
create a similar stub for every optional library that is less portable
than the software that uses it.
Devuan could probably benefit from reducing its maintenance effort by
having libsystemd-dummy provide libsystemd-dev even on Linux kernels,
so that fewer packages need sourceful changes.
