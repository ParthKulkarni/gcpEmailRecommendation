source package name, please.

This might create more problems... getting BTS emails for two different
source packages at the same @packages.debian.org alias might create
problems at the package tracker level. It will see bug reports for "foo"
received at an email address tagged for "bar" and it might be
misclassified.
Really $source@packages.debian.org should be used for single packages. As
soon as you have a set of related packages, you need to use the concept of
a packaging team.
I will work on offering a team-based email address at the package tracker
level for this kind of need.
