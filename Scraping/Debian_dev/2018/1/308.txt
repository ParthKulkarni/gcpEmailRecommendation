Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I request assistance with maintaining the broadcom-sta package.
I don't have permanent access to related hardware nor do I use similar
devices regularly, so my detector for all new breakages (mostly
kernel change related) has been non-functional for months, causing nasty
delays in support coverage.
Fortunatelly, the package has apparently still lots of active users who
come along with usable patches (but sometimes also with weird ones,
therefore having strong C language knowledge and some kernel
infrastructure knowledge is advisable).
The package description is:
 Broadcom STA is a binary-only device driver to support the following IEEE
 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network cards: BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-,
 BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43142-, BCM43224-, BCM43225-, BCM43227-, BCM43228-,
 BCM4331-, BCM4360-, and BCM4352-based hardware.
 .
 This package contains the common files and it should not be installed manually
 (it will be installed automatically as needed).
MfG/best regards,
Eduard.
