I was surprised recently to see a lintian warning about a
Standards-Version I had updated only a few months previously.
But I'm a hardy soul who is quite prepared to see a warning and decide
to ignore it :-).
My view is that the purpose of a warning is to alert you to something,
so you can decide what to do about it.  That decision might well be
"nothing right now" (or even "nothing, ever").
