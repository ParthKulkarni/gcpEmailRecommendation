I think Marco wants to suggest that they don't seem to actively maintain
sysvinit and therefore the package is in practice unmaintained.

No maintainer has replied for almost half a year (when the bug was
filed)...  sysvinit probably only stays in testing because systemd
depends on sysv-rc for compatability with LSB init scripts...

And the remaining packages of the sysvinit ecosystem are unmaintained
too, for example insserv (#834284) and startpar (#834283).  Or
systemd-shim if you want to consider desktop systems too.
