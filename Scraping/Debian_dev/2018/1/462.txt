  Description     : C++11 library for handling processes (runtime libraries)
process-cpp is a simple and straightforward wrapper around process creation
and control. It helps both with handling child processes and with interacting
with the current process. Some of its features include:
- Thread-safe get/set/unset operation on the current process's environment.
- Throwing and non-throwing overloads of functions when system calls are
involved.
- Seamless redirection of input, output and error streams of child processes.
- Type-safe interaction with the virtual proc filesystem, both for reading &
writing.
The library's main purpose is to assist in testing and when a software
component needs to carry out process creation/control tasks, e.g., a graphical
shell. To this end, the library is extensively tested and tries to ensure
fail-safe operation as much as possible.
This package includes the process-cpp runtime libraries.
