  Description     : Simple two way ordered dictionary for Python
TwoWayOrderedDict is a custom dictionary in which you can get the key:value relationship but you can also get the value:key relationship. It also remembers the order in which the items were inserted and supports almost all the features of the build-in dict.
This package is a dependency of youtube-dl-gui, another ITP of mine.
I intend to maintain the package in the Debian Python Modules Team.
