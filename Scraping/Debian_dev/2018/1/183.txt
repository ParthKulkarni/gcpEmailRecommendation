And is the reason this is preferable to `dpkg-vendor` based stuff
because `dpkg-vendor` cannot affect debian/control in the same way
(without tricks to autogenerate control at build time)?

This requires that Debian defines (together with the downstream(s)) a
semantic for the profile which satisfies them. Previously in the thread
you said "I think that is up to the derivative to define" which I think
isn't the case, it has to be a Debian based policy if the patches are
to go into Debian. What happens if two downstreams have different ideas
of what a given profile should mean?
Going down this path starts to look a lot like the USE flags used by
source base distros, and while it might be tollerable as a one off it
seems likely that once the precedent is established the usage will
proliferate (noselinux, noapparmor, nodbus, noblah,...) which would
seem to go against our current principal of enabling most options if
they cause no harm if not used.
I also agree with Russ' point that on the case of `nosystemd` we
actually want to be able to support that use case in Debian, and a
profile for use by downstreams doesn't appear to satisfy that need.
