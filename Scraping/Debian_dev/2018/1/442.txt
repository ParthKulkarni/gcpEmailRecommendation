Hi all,
I was looking at the fonts page[1] on the wiki and it mentions:
"For most uses, youâ€™ll want TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (OTF) fonts"
In fact, is it necessary to install both, or just OTF if the same font
is available as both?
On a system that has been upgraded from etch through several Debian
versions up to stretch, I found Firefox was behaving badly, especially
when printing pages containing Helvetica.  It is a little chunky on
screen but almost unreadable when rendered on the printer.
Can anything be done to make this easier for users who have upgraded?
Looking on the web page, I used "Inspect Element" to identify the font
(Helvetica)
and then I checked which font is used:
$ fc-match helvetica
helvR12-ISO8859-1.pcf.gz: "Helvetica" "Regular"
That is a bitmap font in xfonts-100dpi and xfonts-75dpi on my system.
I tried installing the OTF and TTF packages (which were missing) with:
apt install fonts-freefont-otf fonts-freefont-ttf
but that still didn't work.
Next I tried adding the MS fonts with
apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
and that didn't resolve it either, next I tried
sudo fc-cache -v
but it was still using the PCF bitmap font.
Finally, I saw the suggestion on the wiki to run:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig fontconfig-config
and that fixed the problem.
Can anything be done to make this easier for users who have upgraded?
Regards,
Daniel
