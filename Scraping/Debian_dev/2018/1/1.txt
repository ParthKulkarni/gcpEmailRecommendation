Not quite. It means we should maintain support for sysvinit *scripts*
for the foreseeable future; there's no good reason for us to break
support for /etc/init.d/* any time soon. (It might become necessary to
provide a migration mechanism that helps sysadmins move their legacy
rcS.d scripts, but that shouldn't be particularly hard when nothing in
Debian ships such scripts anymore.)
