  Description     : Pytest plugin that enables the generation and comparison of data arrays
This is a py.test plugin to facilitate the generation and comparison
of data arrays produced during tests. The basic idea is that you can
write a test that generates a Numpy array (or other related objects
depending on the format). You can then either run the tests in a mode
to generate reference files from the arrays, or you can run the tests
in comparison mode, which will compare the results of the tests to the
reference ones within some tolerance.
It is a new build dependency of astropy 3.0.
I will maintain it within the Debian Python team.
Best regards
Ole
