Why is it making comparing packages with each other difficult? It's an 
additional annotation of what the package actually contains. If you 
upload the set of bootstrap packages and especially if you have multiple 
intermediate stages, you surely would want to know which packages will 
need to be rebuilt to the point of not requiring build profiles anymore, 
no?
At the same time for a stable port the archive can ensure that the build 
profile was actually the default one (or accept divergences with a 
conscious decision, like using NEW or BYHAND).
So I don't think it's as black and white wrt full flexibility in 
dependencies as you paint it. :)
