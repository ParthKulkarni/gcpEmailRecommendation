  Description     : converts 2D drawings to G-code for CNC machines
This program reads 2D drawings (in DXF, PDF, or Postscript form) and
produces G-code for running on CNC machines.  Supports tabs (aka breaks).
Supports multiple tools. Integrates well with LinuxCNC.
dxf2gcode is a CAM program that reads 2-dimensional mechanical drawings
of parts, and produces G-code that can be run on CNC machines to produce
those parts.  It is similar in function to a "slicer" for 3d printing
(like the slic3er package), but for subtractive fabrication with milling
machines and lathes.
There are several closed-source CAM programs (SolidCAM, MasterCAM,
CamBam, Fusion 360, etc) but precious few open-source ones, and this
shortcoming is preventing adoption of open-source software by hobbyists
and small manufacturing shops.
I have been an active developer in the open-source fabrication software
space since 2007.  I have developed and maintained debian packaging
for several projects, but I have never tried to get any of them into
mainline debian before.
Back in 2016 I briefly assisted Ruben Undheim in updating the
fpga-icestorm package, and learned lots from him.  I am hoping to find
a mentor and sponsor to help me make the dxf2gcode package acceptable
for inclusion into debian.
I have started packaging dxf2gcode (for Stretch).  My packages are here:
    http://highlab.com/~seb/dxf2gcode/
My gbp repo is here: 
    https://github.com/SebKuzminsky/dxf2gcode
I think the package is in pretty good shape: it installs and runs on mine
and my friends' computers, it produces g-code that runs on LinuxCNC,
and both the dsc and deb are fairly clean according to lintian (though
not perfect).
I *am* a bit concerned about the version numbers.  Upstream uses YYYYMMDD
date tags as the release version, and I just piggybacked on that.
Should I add an epoch?
Any other shortcomings/mistakes?  I welcome any feedback.
