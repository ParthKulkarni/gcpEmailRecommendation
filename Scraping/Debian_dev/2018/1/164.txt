Thanks for correction.  I made the blind assumption that the Maintainer:
field has at least some accuracy.  I'm used to Debian workflows, not
Devuan's.
If the whole credit goes to you, good!

Actually, Simon McVittie described a proposal that KatolaZ opined as not
merely acceptable but "a great solution".  It would allow every Debian
package that currently depends on libpam-systemd to be usable on Devuan
without even recompiling, much less a sourceful change -- all while handling
future compat breaks sanely.  I'll see how I can assist.
As for eudev, the only group who can deny a package into the archive are the
ftpmasters, although being useful wrt dependencies is another matter.  If
you think strongly about having such standby package ready, I can sponsor
it into experimental -- on the other hand, unless you can show some benefit,
I strongly would advise against having it in unstable, as it'd complicate
the lives of udev maintainers for no clear gain.  They promised to not make
udev systemd only, and I see no reason for them to renege -- the decision
belongs to a person employed by Red Hat, who could make a future release
require systemd.  If that happens, well, _then_ it'd be time to put eudev
into unstable.
Meow!
