  Description     : filter logfiles for today's date in an Artificial Ignorance-compatible way
 filter-other-days filters logfiles for today's date in an Artificial
 Ignorance-compatible way. That means it throws away entries that it's
 sure aren't from today, instead of filtering for entries it thinks
 are from today.
 This is done for security reasons; it's better to receive irrelevant
 information than it is to miss relevant information. Thus
 filter-other-days is useful as a part of a larger Artificial
 Ignorance setup if the administrator wants to e.g. get a daily report
 emailed to them.
The package description above pretty much covers why I think this
package is useful. The last time I sent this ITP my mail got sent to
/dev/null due to a local misconfiguration; at the time I found at
least one package in Debian that provided similar functionality, but
that package provided a larger suite of tools to deal with logfiles
whereas filter-other-days has a more limited purpose.
Note that I would need a sponsor to get this into the archive as I am
neither a DD nor a DM. I am, however, the upstream maintainer. I
intend to maintain Debian packaging in tandem with the source code in
the upstream repository and in fact already have packaging written
which passes Lintian with no errors or warnings in pedantic mode.
filter-other-days will run on any system with POSIX and GNU `seq`,
which Debian fulfills handily even with nothing but essential
installed.
Cheers!
AJ
