Specify as the first line[s] of your mail to 888475@bugs.debian.org :
Control: retitle -1 ITP: my-doodad: new swanky short desc
The rest of the bug is immutable, but is not read by machine, just humans --
so instead of replacing, you post the new version.
This said, you don't need to make the posted description be identical to
what will be uploaded, it's just a starting point so people can comment upon
it.
Keeping the short desc (bug title) is more important -- not strictly
required, but it makes reading WNPP a lot more accurate.
Meow!
