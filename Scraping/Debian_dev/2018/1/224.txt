As it is now, we have a lot of people who are maintaining their own
packages outside of Debian. Can we get enough support to reintegrate
both the people and the code?
This is a social more than a technical problem at the moment.
Case in point: the subthread[1] starting with Marco D'Itri's

that libsystemd is installed on their computers.
Two well-known DDs chimed in in support, and all replies from DDs to
critical replies were completely dismissive of the criticism. Previous
instances of this have been similar.
What should I tell the people who are now maintaining these packages
outside of Debian will happen if they return? As of now, I have no
answer that would not be met with "see, that is why we left."
