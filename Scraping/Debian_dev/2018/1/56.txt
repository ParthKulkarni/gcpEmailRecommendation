Currently there are two related tags:
* https://lintian.debian.org/tags/out-of-date-standards-version.html
  which is reported when an upload is done and the date of the
  changelog is older than the date of a policy release newer than what
  is in Std-Ver. (I.e. a package doesn't get this if no uploads are
  done, but it assumes that when somebody updates a package the
  maintainer checks whether it is compliant to the very last Policy
  update, which IMHO it is totally reasonableâ€¦?)
* https://lintian.debian.org/tags/ancient-standards-version.html
  which is reported if the mentioned Std-Ver has been superseded for
  more than two years (i.e. this is the tag a package gains for not
  being updated in that much time and a new Policy release happened in
  the meantime).
They are both warnings, and IMHO they are both totally valid as
warnings.
If you update your package you should spend your time checking it is
still Policy compliant (how would you know it is otherwise without
checking?!), and bumping this tiny field is just a marker you did so.
What do you propose to change?  Consider that before this August (i.e.,
when the Policy editor teams got revamped) Policy releases were fairly
rare, and for sure you wouldn't want to wait 2 releases (average of ~3
years, by looking at it) before warningâ€¦ And honestly I hope it gets
back to fewer and smaller releases soon again, as it is honestly hard
for me as well to keep up with the changes (I could remember 3.9.{6,7,8}
changes by heart, I can't with the latestâ€¦).  But it doesn't mean that I
as a maintainer should make an effort to keep up and check for Policy
compliance at each package update.
