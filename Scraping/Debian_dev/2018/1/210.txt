To "make many of the embedded specific distribution solutions obsolete",
Debian would have to provide all this in stable releases at a quality
comparable to Yocto.

For many use flags the only benefit is an unused library less on
the system when the flag is disabled, and this also applies to the
proposed nosystemd profile discussed in this bug.
Support for nosystemd in only 95% of all libsystemd-using packages would
still result in libsystemd being installed - if just one maintainer 
would refuse to apply a nosystemd patch, the people working on nosystemd
in Debian basically have to rely on CTTE overruling the maintainer.
Your "build profiles for use flags" can easily require changes to 
hundreds of packages just for one flag, often including non-trivial 
changes to e.g. debian/rules or .install files.
This only makes sense if there is consensus that this is a useful
direction, and that this should be fully supported in future stable
releases of Debian.
