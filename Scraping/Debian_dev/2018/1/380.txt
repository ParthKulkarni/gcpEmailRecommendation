  Description     : Spectre & Meltdown vulnerability/mitigation checker
A simple shell script to tell if your Linux installation is vulnerable
against the 3 "speculative execution" CVEs that were made public early 2018.
Hopefully, this will give an easy way for Debian users to check if their systems
are affected or not.
