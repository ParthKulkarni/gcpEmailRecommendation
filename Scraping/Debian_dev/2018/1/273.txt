  Description     : Python package for numerical quantum transport
 Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport
 calculations. It exposes the natural concepts of the theory of quantum
 transport (lattices, symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole
 degrees of freedom) in a simple and transparent way. Kwant offers direct
 support for calculations of transport properties (conductance, noise,
 scattering matrix), dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, various
 Greenâ€™s functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other
 computations involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented
 easily.
Kwant is a scientific library that is popular with condensed matter
physicists.  Since it became public in 2013, Kwant has been used by
researchers around the world in numerous projects that lead to over 180
scientific articles.  In 2017 alone the number of such publications was
80. [1]
I'm one of the main developers of Kwant and have been maintaining
unofficial Debian and Ubuntu packages for it since 2013.  We're
committed to maintain both Kwant and its Debian package for years to
come.  Since I haven't been active in Debian so far, I need a sponsor
for this package.
Kwant depends on tinyarray [2], a Python extension module written in C++
that implements a subset of NumPy that is optimized for very small
arrays.  Tinyarray is fully independent of Kwant, but has seen little use outside of Kwant.  Shall I file an ITP for tinyarray as well?
