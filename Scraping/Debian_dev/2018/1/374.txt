  Description     : convert statistical analysis objects into tidy data frames with GNU R
 Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames,
 so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise processed
 with tools like 'dplyr', 'tidyr' and 'ggplot2'. The package provides three
 S3 generics: tidy, which summarizes a model's statistical findings such as
 coefficients of a regression; augment, which adds columns to the original
 data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance, which
 provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
Remark: I'm currently trying to get all dependencies for Shiny-Server
and this package is one of these.  It will be maintained in r-pkg-team
(since there is no mailing list yet
debian-science-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org is used as
Maintainer).  The maintenance repository is
