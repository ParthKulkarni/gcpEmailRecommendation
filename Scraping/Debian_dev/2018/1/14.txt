Only if you additionally have time to read the updated Debian Policy and 
ensure that the package complies with that newer version, should you 
bump Standards-Version.
(possibly that's what you meant)
Purpose of the Standards-Version field is *not* to keep you busy 
silencing corresponding lintian warning, but to state which version of 
Debian Policy the package is verified to comply with.
