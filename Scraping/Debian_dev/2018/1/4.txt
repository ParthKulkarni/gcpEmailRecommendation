I think the level of complexity is an important factor as well. For a 
simple "start this daemon" script, it's not a big deal. If the script 
needs to have a bunch of complex logic to support different use cases it 
doesn't make sense at this point to write both a systemd target and an 
init script--the init script isn't going to get much testing, and it's 
likely that there will be more bugs in the complicated logic than 
there'd be for someone who just hard codes their own requirements into 
rc.local (or whatever). As an example think of something like 
openvpn--if the init script didn't already exist, it would be a lot 
easier for someone to just kick off a single openvpn process than to 
make sure that all the logic that sets up multiple processes with 
different configurations was working properly on both systemd & sysvinit 
systems. As the number of sysvinit users continues to decline, I think 
simpler is better to minimize bugs in seldom-used code paths.
