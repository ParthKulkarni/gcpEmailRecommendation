  Description     : read to use project templates for KiCad
KiCad is a cross platform and Open Source EDA (Electronics Design Automation)
suite which can be used for the creation of electronic schematic diagrams and
PCB artwork. The flexibility is mainly based on libraries for schematic symbols,
footprints and 3D models. But it also offers a template mechanism which makes it
easy for user to base their work on prepared projects which can include
prearranged schematic and or basic PCB layouts.
Really common examples for such templates are well prepared PCB layouts for the
Arduino boards but also for Raspberry PI or BeagleBone.
Such templates are currently installed by kicad-common. Due the regular updates
to the kicad-templates library it's difficult to follow that dynamic development
with the more contrary static preparation of point releases of KiCad without
(the mostly unneeded) completely rebuild of the existing src:kicad package.
Like done for the schematic symbols, footprints and 3d-packages this ITP is to
move out the templates into a own source package and make package maintenance
easier. For the users this brings more frequent updates of the KiCad community
templates.
The package will be maintained in the pkg-electronics-team together with
Jean-Samuel Reynaud (maintainer of the daily build PPA for Ubuntu).
We will try to keep the package the same in Debian and Ubuntu. More Co
maintainers are welcome!
