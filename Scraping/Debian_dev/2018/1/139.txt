I suspect that having the archive split into main/contrib/non-free
involves a non-trivial amount of work.  Yet Debian as a project, to
serve its users and derivatives, undertakes the work.
As has already been pointed out by others, if someone is interested in
doing the work and it is not too invasive or disruptive to other parts
of Debian, then it should be done.
That said, I find that your characterization of someone not wanting
systemd installed on their system as "disturbed" to itself be somewhat
disturbing.  You cannot possibly know what grounds someone might have
for not wanting systemd, and to automatically and universally
characterize that as "disturbed" implies a value judgment that runs
counter both to the freeness and universailty that Debian as a project
espouses.
