I think it did during the default init system transition, but it doesn't
any more.
sysvinit-utils is still Essential: yes, because it contains binaries that
were historically part of the Essential set; *that* keeps src:sysvinit
in testing. There are plans to make sysvinit-utils non-Essential by
moving pidof to a new Essential package built from src:procps (lots
of packages blindly assume that pidof exists, so adding dependencies
doesn't seem feasible) and adding dependencies for the few uses of the
other sysvinit-utils binaries, which have been OK'd in principle by the
maintainer of src:sysvinit, but haven't happened yet.
Other binary packages from src:sysvinit also have a disproportionately
high popcon score because they used to be Essential, and are not
always auto-removed when no longer used, which keeps them in the key
packages list.
sysv-rc and initscripts are both present on about 72% of installations
that report to popcon, even though systemd-sysv is present on about 78%
of those installations and sysvinit-core is present on less than 2%.
I don't know what's going on in the other 20% - surely they can't all
be wheezy or older? Perhaps some of them are chroots or containers with
no init system at all?
