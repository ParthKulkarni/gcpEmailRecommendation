Hi,
Moving repo to salsa and starting an alternative ML have been done.
I am now wondering what is the best practice for closing alioth service
when occasional diverse committers are involved. 
* How can I easily set up redirection service for incoming mails to an
  aioth ML forwarded to a new l.d.o address?
* How to disable alioth ML sending out message to subscribers.
  (I have already informed subscribers about changes)
* How can I make alioth git service as read only?
  My thought:
  1. Remove all files and leave one README file explaining migration
  2. Shell access to alioth and do something like "chmod -R ugo-w ." safe?
  (Or is there any clean and simple redirection service method?)
* What to do with the weblate translation service?
Pointer to an pertinent wiki page is appreciated.
Osamu
