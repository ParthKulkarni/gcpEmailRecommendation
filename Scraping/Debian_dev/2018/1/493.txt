  Description     : footprint libraries for KiCad's Pcbnew editor
Pcbnew is a powerful printed circuit board software and part of the
KiCad suite.
Pcbnew manages libraries of footprints. Each footprint is a drawing of
the physical component including its land pattern (the layout of pads on
the circuit board). Footprints have a strong relationship to the
schematic symbols that are used in Eeschema and both parts
(kicad-symbols and kicad-footprints) depending on each other in some
way.
Like for the schematic symbols the footprints are also evolving and
growing fast and this brings in some difficulty to provide actual footprint
data for KiCad within Debian and like planned for the schematic symbols
the footprints need to go also into a own source package.
This is another part of transitioning the existing kicad-common package
into dedicated smaller packages.
The package will be maintained in the pkg-electronics-team together with
Jean-Samuel Reynaud (maintainer of the daily build PPA for Ubuntu).
We will try to keep the package the same in Debian and Ubuntu. More Co
maintainers are welcome!
