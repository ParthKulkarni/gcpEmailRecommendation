If this is about avoiding linking with libsystemd, I think this is
unbelievably silly and a completely waste of maintainer time and emotional
energy.
I'm one of the people who has been advocating for continuing to support
systems without systemd running.  I think that's both meaningful and
important.  Avoiding linking with a shared library that does nothing when
systemd is not running is neither meaningful nor important.  Please do not
squander other people's good will on trivia like this.
