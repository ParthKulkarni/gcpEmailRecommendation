That seems to be another good reason to not take this path, since we want
to support non-systemd systems *in Debian*, not just for some downstream.
So if we figure out how to build a version of a package for such systems,
we want to upload it to our main archive so that Debian users can use it.

Only if upstream never, ever wants to use them, yes?  In which case, it
seems like a very *odd* way to upstream patches.  Normally the goal of
upstreaming packages is to allow upstream to, er, use them.
