  Description     : Arrays of numbers, optimized for small sizes
 Tinyarray is a numerical array module for Python.  The
 multi-dimensional arrays it provides are best thought of as (possibly
 nested) tuples of numbers that, unlike Python's built-in tuples,
 support mathematical operations.  Like tuples, tinyarrays are hashable
 and immutable and thus can be used as dictionary keys.  The module's
 interface is a subset of that of NumPy and hence should be familiar to
 many Python programmers.  Tinyarray has been heavily optimized for
 small arrays: For example, common operations on 1-d arrays of length 3
 run 3-7 times faster than with NumPy.  When storing many small arrays,
 memory consumption is reduced by a factor of 3.  In summary, Tinyarray
 is a more efficient alternative to NumPy when many separate small
 numerical arrays are to be used.
Tinyarray is needed for Kwant [1].  I'm it's main developer and have
been maintaining unofficial Debian and Ubuntu packages for it since
2013.
