  Description     : Tk toolkit for Tcl and X11, v8.7
Tk is a cross-platform graphical toolkit which provides the Motif
look-and-feel and is implemented using the Tcl scripting language.
This is a new upstream release with some potential incompatibilities
with the older ones, so it's as usual packaged separately.
The package will be maintained under Debian Tcl/Tk team.
Version 8.7 is in alpha stage yet, so I'm planning to upload this
package to experimental.
