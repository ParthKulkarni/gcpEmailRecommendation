Sure.  The debian/rules.custom support that I put in predates the
Debian build profiles spec, but it's basically the same idea.  So it
should be pretty simple to migrate things to use the build profile
concept; it's just a matter of wiring up things slightly differently
in debian/rules.
I haven't looked at build profiles spec super-closely yet, but since
it looks like there is core infrastructural support for it in dpkg,
debhelpers, and friends, it's no longer necessary to run
debian/control.in through m4 to generate debian/control (which is how
I did things sans dpkg support).
Send me a patch, either sent to linux-ext4@vger.kernel.org, or as
Debian bug, and I'll happily take it.
My only real concern is whether this might complicate building the
latest version of e2fsprogs for stable and old-stable for
debian-backports.
