What I meant here was what I mentioned elsewhere in this thread. We can check
whether two binary packages built with a different set of build profiles active
are actually the same by using the tools from the reproducible builds project.
And the easiest way to do the comparison is to compare their hashes. If the
build profile would be included, then comparing the packages would be made more
difficult.

I would rather say that the set of build profiles active is a property of the
*build* and not a property of the binary package. Especially considering that
most build profiles require identical package contents. We also don't store in
binary packages which build dependencies were installed in which version during
the build even though this is also something that can have great influence on
the content of the binary package.  Instead, we store this information in the
buildinfo file which I also find a better fit for storing the information which
build profiles were active because build profiles are a property of the package
build.

At all points during the bootstrapping, we know which source packages we built
with with which profiles active either by simply keeping track of what is being
done or by investigating the generated buildinfo files which contain that
information. It is not necessary to have this information stored in the binary
packages itself for this purpose.

The archive can already do this check by investigating the buildinfo file that
was uploaded together with the binary packages.

Surely, rarely anything is really black and white. :)
Thanks!
