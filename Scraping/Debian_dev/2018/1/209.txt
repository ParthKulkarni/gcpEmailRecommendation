No one.  People would implement and test the feature where it was
sufficiently useful to implement and test.  I don't think all of the use
flags combinations are tested in source distributions that have them
today.
Even so, users find those flags useful enough to spend a fair bit of
work on them.
A build profile seems like a great way to express the flag, and like
many things in Debian, the work would fall on those who would benefit
from it.
So, I do support the use of build profiles for use flags.
I also believe there's sufficient utility for downstreams and users to
justify this.
