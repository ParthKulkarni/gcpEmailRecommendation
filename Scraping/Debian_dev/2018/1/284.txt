Package: general
Severity: normal
If debian is remotely serious about keeping non-systmed use an option,
is should support a nosystemd build profile.  There's no other real
way to guarantee that packages don't use it.  Sure they don't *have*
to link against it, but in practice many will and this is the obvious
clean way to ensure that none do so.
As a long-time user I'm highly interested in this feature, and
preventing others from working on it for idealogical reasons is
indefensible.
