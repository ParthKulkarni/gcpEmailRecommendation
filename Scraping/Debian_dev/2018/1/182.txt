The discussion has forked into a serious discussion about how to enable
software to run properly without systemd being PID 1, and a separate
discussion about attempting to build without libsystemd.
The latter serves no actual purpose that anyone can discern other than
getting software to build on systems where libsystemd doesn't exist at all
(Hurd, etc.), which currently is already largely solved via architecture
exclusions and arguably even better solved via libsystemd-dummy (which
already exists but needs some love).  My impression was that we'd already
put that discussion mostly to rest.
I was therefore remarking on the former point: how to enable software to
run properly without systemd being PID 1, something that Debian also
wants, and for which a build profile seems like a very poor fit.
