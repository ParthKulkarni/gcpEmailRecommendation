  Description     : Mustache implementation in C++11
Mstch is a complete implementation of {{mustache}} templates using
modern C++. It's compliant with specifications v1.1.3, including the
lambda module.
Mustache is a logic-less template language. As such, it is very well
suited for programs that are written in a compiled language, such as C
and C++, as they cannot easily evaluate code found in a template.
However, no C or C++ implementation of Mustache is in Debian yet, so
this package fills that gap, at least for C++.
Currently, this only builds a static library. The binary package will
be called libmstch-dev.
