dpkg-buildpackage does support -J in stretch (starting with dpkg 1.18.2).
But if -jN breaks, that's because the package is not parallel build
safe, so using -J will not improve things, as the package has not
opted in (or has opted out depending on the debhelper used) from
parallel builds anyway.
Thanks,
