Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I request assistance with maintaining the ed package. I would also be
willing to give up maintenance of this package in long term. I do not
find the time any more to maintain the package (that is basicly
installed on everyones machine) in a proper timely fashion.
The package has an active upstream developer, with 1-3 releases per
year. 
The package description is:
 ed is a line-oriented text editor.  It is used to
 create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text
 files.
 .
 red is a restricted ed: it can only edit files in the
 current directory and cannot execute shell commands.
