The fact that this information is no longer exposed in the binary control
file is news to me, and very disappointing.  It seems clear to me that one
*should* be able to determine what profile(s) a package was built with by
looking at the package itself.
As a policy, I think it's clear that packages built with non-default
profiles should never be included in the Debian archive; and segregating
packages into archives by stage is a sensible way to do this for
bootstrapping.  I don't know /what/ one should expect in a world where
profiles are used for other purposes but aren't documented in the binary
control; I guess it just reinforces the fact that you can't trust
third-party deb packages...
In any case, I think the value actually accrues primarily to the simple
cases; because if you want to maintain a package over time, setting a flag
and rebuilding requires much less human involvement than having to
repeatedly merge changes into a package.
