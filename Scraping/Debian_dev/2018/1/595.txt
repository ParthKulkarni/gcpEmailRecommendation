Packages removed from testing outside of the freeze can be easily
re-added to testing once the underlying RC bugs are fixed. So RMs should
continue to remove early, and remove often. [When this has happened with
my packages (see lilypond), it's resulted in more people helping with
the maintenance of them, and brought some issues to a wider audience.]

Of course, there are cases where only a rare individual will have the
vision to perceive a system which governs many people's lives; a
system which had never before even been recognized as a system; then
such people often devote their lives to convincing other people that
the system really is there and that it aught to be exited from.
