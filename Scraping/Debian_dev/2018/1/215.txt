When the sole purpose of a rebuild is to get rid of unused library(ies),
the rebuild only makes sense if this is supported throughout the whole
distribution.
The problematic cases are the non-trivial ones,
and what support Debian wants to provide for that.
It would make the life for the Devuan people much easier if Debian
would be committed to have *all* packages in buster build and work
with --disable-optional=libsystemd-dev.
Are you as release manager willing to make this a supported feature
for buster, with breakages being RC bugs?
For small embedded systems, having this only for one library
doesn't bring that many benefits.
For how many libraries are you release manager willing to make 
--disable-optional a supported feature for buster, with breakages
being RC bugs?
It is really important to look at it top-down from what Debian
wants to officially support in the end - these technical details
only matter if Debian will officially support rebuilding the
whole archive of a stable release with fewer libraries.
