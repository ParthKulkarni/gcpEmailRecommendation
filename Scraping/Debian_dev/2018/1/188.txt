Arguably yes. A significant number of packages that ship gtk-doc (about
half of what's on my laptop) put it in /usr/share/gtk-doc/html (which
is necessary anyway because it's where gtk-doc and devhelp will look),
with a symlink in /usr/share/doc/$package; IMO that's correct. The
other half are the other way round, with the real documentation in
/usr/share/doc/$package and a symlink in /usr/share/gtk-doc/html.
(It doesn't particularly matter in practice, because gtk-doc HTML tends
to be large enough that maintainers want to break it out into libfoo-doc,
which means the sort of people who want to delete /usr/share/doc will
just not install it.)
