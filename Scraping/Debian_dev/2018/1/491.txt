  Description     : nose plugin to facilitate randomized unit testing with Python
 Python nose-random is designed to facilitate Monte-Carlo style unit testing.
 The idea is to improve testing by running your code against a large number
 of randomly generated input scenarios.
 .
 Even with random testing it's important that test success/failure is
 reproducible, otherwise it's hard to
 .
   * know if you've fixed a failing test
   * know if an test fails only on some machines or configurations and not
     others
   * debug a failing test
 .
 nose-random avoids this pitfall because it
 .
   * uses a fixed seed so that each test run is identical
   * tells you which scenario caused a test to fail
   * lets you to run the test only on a specific scenario to facilitate
     debugging
Remark: This package is needed to run the build time tests of python-jsondiff
 (#888012) which in turn is needed to package python-moto (#777089) which in
 turn is needed to upgrade pandas to its latest version.  It will be
 maintained by the Debian Science team at
    https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/python-nose-random.git
Co-maintainers are more than welcome.
