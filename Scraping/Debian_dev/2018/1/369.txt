  Description     : Tcl (the Tool Command Language) v8.7
Tcl is a powerful, easy-to-use, embeddable, cross-platform interpreted
scripting language.
It's a new upstream release with some incompatibilities with the
earlier ones (8.6, 8.5), so it's traditionally packaged separately.
The package will be maintained under the Debian Tcl/Tk team.
Version 8.7 is in alpha stage yet, so I intend to upload it to
experimental at the moment.
