Hello all,
Given I've poked a bit at what Simon mentions below in the past and
don't really have any intention to follow this (and any other remaining
item mentioned at [0]) through (and not aware of anyone else picking it
up either), I thought I'd take this opportunity to share a bit about my
view on it in the hope that it can help someone pick it up.

First, what Simon says is in my view an accurate description.
Using the pidof implementation provided by procps (upstream) would
mean we atleast use the same implementation as other distros, but
wouldn't gain us much else and could even give us new problems.
By building an essential procps-pidof package would relieve src:sysvinit
from bootstrapping, but instead introduce src:procps. I assume
bootstrappers have sysvinit well under control already, but no idea if
procps would cause issues for them (possibly it may need to introduce
some build profiles atleast).
In the best of worlds we would make pidof non-essential. So who are
the users? Well unfortunately it's not very easy to codesearch[1]
for pidof users, because there are lots of "false positives" (and
I'm not as patient and thorough as Helmut has been while investigating
e2fsprogs), but from glancing over the results the main users of pidof
seems to be init scripts. One potential solution here could be to
replace the pidof usage with the LSB function pidofproc[2] (but note how
the optional last "unspecified method" in practise seems to be
implemented by calling pidof[3] when available and I'm not what the
impact would be if the first condition that today always is true starts
becoming false most of the time instead). While looking at a selection
of these init scripts they stand out as very old style. Likely updating
them to be somewhat modern (by sysvinit standards) would likely mean
totally rewriting them as LSB compatible init scripts.
I personally doubt we'll see a major widespread effort within the Debian
community to overhaul init scripts in our archive at this point. (Even
the Debian LSB maintainer says LSB is basically dead at this point, but
as a challenge to all potential sysvinit supporters out there please
prove me wrong by makin Debians init scritps LSB compatible!)
If anyone out there has ideas on how we could practically (iow, with a
somewhat sane amount of work) accomplish this in a different way I'd be
interested in hearing about it.
The most practical thing to do at this point seems to be to just wait
until sysvinit is eventually removed from Debian, add a lintian check
that suggests people to also drop any init scripts they're shipping
in their packages (cf. the upstart removal which happened surprisingly
quickly in my view but may not be comparable), and then investigate
after a while again where we have pidof users and if the package
providing pidof can be demoted to non-Essential. Given that we're still
having these threads like the one leading up to this message makes me
think this in not happening any time soon though....
If anyone out there is interested in working on this (or any other item
on [0], or anything similar/related to it) please contact me!
HTH
