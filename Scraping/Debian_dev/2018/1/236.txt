The utopia stack currently hard-depends on systemd; I haven't tested a
_partially_ rebuilt set of packages in quite a while (since The Great
Flamewar, which happened just before jessie freeze, to be exact) -- at that
time, even well-tested patches were routinely rejected with angry messages,
so I didn't bother and just started my private repository, which is fully
rebuilt.  I was also not a DD at the time.
It'd be good to look for such regressions, but not right now -- a change to
elogind, consolekit65536 (I lost track of its forks), loginkit or Parabola's
notsystemd would invalidate such findings anyway.  I'll poke some folks who
can help evaluate the alternatives.
Doing such research myself would require learning a lot about logind, and
that'd require tuits I need for playing with a yet another random SoC,
molesting an obscure terminal font's upstream about license or trying to get
a controversial patch past Al Viro :p.
