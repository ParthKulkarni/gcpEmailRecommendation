Or IOW:
  cmp a.deb b.deb
vs
  dpkg-deb -R a.deb a
  dpkg-deb -R b.deb b
  sed -i -e '/^Built-For-Profiles/d' a/DEBIAN/control
  sed -i -e '/^Built-For-Profiles/d' b/DEBIAN/control
  diff -Naur a b
While then not comparing the actual .deb, for any other suspicious
members, difference in format, strange padding, etc, or control.tar
metadata changes.

Actually this information is also readily available in the .changes
file which DAK is already parsing.
