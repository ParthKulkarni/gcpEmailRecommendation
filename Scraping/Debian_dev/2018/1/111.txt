Sounds much better, yeah.
Having one package have
    Debian Desktop Theme Team <darkcold-gtk-theme@packages.debian.org>
and another
    Debian Desktop Theme Team <catimages-gtk-theme@packages.debian.org>
gives them different maintainer address; too many people consider the mail
address authoritative and text before it just a variable piece of junk
they ignore.
So please give me something that I can stick into the maintainer field to
have as many tools as possible DTRT.

Wouldn't hurt, yeah.
