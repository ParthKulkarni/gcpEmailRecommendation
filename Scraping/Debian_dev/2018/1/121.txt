It is actionable, in a way.
IME, Debian holds quite some lobbying power, saying "we may end up
disabling this feature or not shipping the package at all" has some
importance to many projects.  That may cause porting works to happen
that would otherwise be deferred indefinitely.
Overriding it is IMHO correct only for those packages that are
inherently python2-only, like backports of modules from the python3
standard library.
Or maybe override it after opening an upstream bug (and put a reference
to it in a comment!!)
