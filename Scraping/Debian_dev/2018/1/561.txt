  Description     : online platform for hosting your own radio station
LibreTime is a web-based scheduling and playout platform that enables you to
run an online or terrestrial radio station. It is forked from Sourcefabric's
Airtime after development on that stalled.
Within LibreTime you can manage content, users and distribution all from your
web-browser. Shows allow you to schedule pre-recorded content as well as
broadcasting live from any incoming live-stream.
It will be maintained on GitHub under the LibreTime community
organisation.
