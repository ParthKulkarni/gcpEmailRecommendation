  Description     : schematic symbols for KiCad's Eeschema editor
Eeschema is a powerful schematic capture software distributed as part of
KiCad. A schematic design with Eeschema is heavily based on the
availability of schematic symbols which needed to be used for creating of
own schematics.
Due the flexibility of Eeschema and the nature of community driven
development of schematics for KiCad with a fast evolution of symbols for
Eeschema it's difficult to keep track of the new and updated symbols
with the more static releases of KiCad itself (currently the schematic
symbols are available by kicad-common). Thus it makes sense to keep the
packaging of symbols for Eeschema in a own source package as this makes
it easier to provide updated packages not only for unstable/testing.
kicad-symbols will be a part of the transition of the existing
kicad-common package into own pieces.
The package will be maintained in the pkg-electronics-team together with
Jean-Samuel Reynaud (maintainer of the daily build PPA for Ubuntu).
We will try to keep the package the same in Debian and Ubuntu. More Co
maintainers are welcome!
