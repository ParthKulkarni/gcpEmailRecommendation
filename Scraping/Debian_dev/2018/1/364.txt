Thank you; I haven't watched it closely nor, to be honest, really worked on
my library in the last decade: 0.16 in 2008, 0.17 in 2014, 173 commits
pending but an unanswered "time for a new release" request from Mar 2017...

Wait, what?  It sends height when it's needed, at the start, but doesn't
send width or format's version until after the whole stream is over?
How are consumers supposed to take it, especially when it's still being
recorded, which is a major use case for tools like this?
This ITP (tlog) for example supports sending the data to syslog -- I don't
think anyone would be interested with having to wait till the end to send
all prior entries in one go.
Meow!
