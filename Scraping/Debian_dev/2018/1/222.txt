We still need a non-systemd ecosystem for everything that is out of
scope for systemd.
I've written a lengthy blog entry[1] about this in 2016. The condensed
argument is that no init system can provide both an imperative and a
descriptive configuration model at the same time unless it solves the
halting problem and resolves the interaction between both configuration
systems. For desktop environments, we need the configuration to be
descriptive and machine writeable, otherwise the configuration dialogs
will not work, but this comes at the price of the flexibility offered by
an imperative language.
Systemd and System V init are two fundamentally different approaches.
Neither can replace the other without breaking core design principles
and becoming completely useless in the process.
