  Description     : Library for the Common Data Access framework for Earth science file formats
CODA is the Common Data Access framework that allows reading of scientific data
from various data formats, including structured ascii, structured binary, XML,
netCDF, CDF, HDF4, HDF5, GRIB, RINEX and SP3. It provides a single consistent
hierarchical view on data independent of the underlying storage format.
CODA is used as a core component in various ESA software among which the ESA
Atmospheric Toolbox (BEAT) and the Broadview Radar Altimetry Toolbox (BRAT).
The CODA software package comes with interfaces for C, Fortran, IDL, MATLAB,
Python, and Java and several useful command-line tools.
