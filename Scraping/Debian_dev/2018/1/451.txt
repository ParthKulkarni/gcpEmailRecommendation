  Description     : Persepolis Download Manager
Persepolis Download Manager is GUI for Aria2.
In case you are not familiar with Aria2, it is a high speed download utility, 
which tries to increase the speed of the download by making several connections 
instead of only one connection. It is working effectively in the countries 
which have a limited internet connection like Iran.
It is written in Python 3 and it helps users who are still not comfortable using 
aria2 directly in the terminal.
The number of users are increasing during the last months and I believe it is 
the time to have it in the Debian repository, so the users can install it 
directly from the official repositories.
