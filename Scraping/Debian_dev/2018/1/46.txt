(This is not an attempt to convince you of another workflow)
gbp-dch allows you to skip these commits based on tags present in the
commit message: "Gbp-Dch: Ignore". I use this frequently for patch
series that add up to "a user visible result" I want present in the
changelog. I also find deleting text from superfluous commits simpler
than writing new entries from scratch (for things I've already typed into
a commit message).
