You don't need a separate build profile in order to not install systemd. 
That is already supported.
What a nosystemd build profile proposes to do is to avoid linking against
*lib*systemd, which is an inert library dependency whose runtime impact
rounds to zero when systemd is not in use.
Treating libsystemd specially, out of all the mostly-unused libraries that
get linked in the archive, is not sensible.
Catering to fanatics who insist on treating it specially, without technical
merit, has no bearing on the freeness or universality of Debian.
