The package header says what profiles it was built with. The package
name+version doesn't change - that's part of the point. No-one should
be trying to put more than one instance of a package built with
different profiles in one repo at one time because stuff will
break. But a downstream distro could enable a profile and build
everything that way and that should be fine.

It's not really complicated. It's just a mechanism for variant package
builds which is formalised in dpkg and related tools (without changing
the package name/version).
And the reason why you'd use it for something like this is that it
lets you upstream patches (which change dependencies) in a reasonably
clean way.
Clearly a downstream distro can instead maintain patches, but we
encourage upstreaming in general and this mechanism allows that.
