We don't *need* them, but it's not a problem if people want to support
it. Debian has always allowed things to be defined by those that want to
do the work.
If adding an official "nosystemd" build profile makes life easier for
people who want to support systemd-less builds, and they send patches to
keep the build profile actually working, then that doesn't hurt us in
any way and I think we should do it.
