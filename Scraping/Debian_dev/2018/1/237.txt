policykit-1 depends on libpam-systemd, which is currently how you spell
"requires a working systemd-logind" in Debian dependencies. systemd-logind
is part of systemd.deb, and requires something that looks a bit like
systemd, either the real systemd as pid 1 or systemd-shim.

Many of these are more about having a working systemd-logind (an improved
ConsoleKit replacement) than they are about having systemd as pid 1:
they need to be able to identify and enumerate user sessions, and match
processes to sessions. If there's a good alternative to systemd-logind
for that purpose, they could talk to that instead.
It looks as though elogind is a fork of systemd-logind with reduced
functionality, no dependency on systemd as pid 1, and logind's D-Bus API
(so, basically systemd-shim done right), so it should be possible for
most of those to talk to elogind's logind-compatible API without code
changes (via libsystemd, even). Now that we have versioned Provides,
one way to achieve that might be for implementations of the logind API
to add Provides: logind (= v) where v is the version of systemd whose
logind API is implemented (currently 219 for elogind and 236 for systemd),
and for depending packages to depend on libpam-systemd (>= v) | logind
(>= v), or even on default-logind | logind (>= v) (with default-logind
provided by libpam-systemd on Debian) to be nice to anti-systemd
derivatives. Obviously >= v can be omitted if recent logind features
are not required.
A few packages do genuinely need systemd as pid 1, or `systemd --user`
as an init-like service manager for user sessions (which in turn requires
both systemd as pid 1 and systemd-logind). dbus-user-session is an example
of a package that requires the `systemd --user` service manager. Packages
in this category are unlikely to be ported to not-systemd, unless the
chosen non-systemd infrastructure grows a lot of functionality that is
basically systemd with the bike shed painted a different colour.
