  Description     : Enki is a fast 2D physics-based robot simulator written in
C++
 Enki is able to simulate cinematics, collisions, sensors and cameras of robots
 evolving on a flat surface. It also provides limited support for friction.
 It is able to simulate groups of robots hundred times faster than realtime
 on a modern desktop computer.
 .
 The library is a build-dependency for the soon-to-come aseba
 package, which allows students to program and simulate the
 robot Thymio, developped by EPFL (Switzerland), which my students
 are using.
