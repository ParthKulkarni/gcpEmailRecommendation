Oh. OK. My bad - apologies for putting bad info in this already-long
thread.  This was definitiely something we considered along the way
and I had thought it got implemented. Ah and in fact it did, but has
since been removed for reproducible-build compatibility, so I'm out
of date, not wrong :-)
An aside, but I'm not convinced this was the right thing to do. A
reproducible build doesn't mean 'reproductible even if you do
different things, like use a different build profile'. Having the
header had utility.

OK, so the mechanism has morphed quite a lot from Guillem's (and then
my) original ideas, in the light of actually using it, to essentially
only be used at package granularity. And that makes sense because it
preserves the 'name/version/arch' tuple as a dependency identifier.
However we do have 'nodoc', which can't possibly produce bit-by-bit
identical packages (unless the docs are in a separate package) so I
don't see how it can be right to say "packages built with a different
build profile but the same name/version/arcitecture are bit-by-bit
identical to each other". Are you saying that you can't use nodoc if
there are docs in a package, or at least that you can only use it as a
build option, not a build profile?
Again, this is very much policy, not mechanism, and seems to me to be
more restrictive than is necessary.

I was talking about the general case of the possibilities of use for
build profiles. I have no strong opinion on how well that works in the
particular nosystemd case as I've not followed all that
discussion.
