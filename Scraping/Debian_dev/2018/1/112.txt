As a first step, I have implemented team+<team-slug>@tracker.debian.org as
a black hole (i.e. incoming emails are dropped):

Yes, it should be usable by everybody, and not restricted to team members.
But to avoid spam, we will probably have to implement a whitelist of some
sort.
Another open question is who should get the mails sent to that address.
Currently mails should probably be sent to all team members who have not muted the
team and who have not disabled the "contact" keyword. But this makes it
hard to subscribe to a very large team to get the team-level messages but
not the package-level messages.
We should really have different subscriptions models:
- team emails only
- team emails and all package emails
- team emails, all package emails except for (blacklist)
- team emails, no package emails except for (whitelist)
Cheers,
