Yeah -- and, unlike most people in this thread, I do maintain a repository
which does that:
deb	https://angband.pl/debian nosystemd-buster main
deb-src	https://angband.pl/debian nosystemd-buster main
(instructions and key at https://angband.pl/deb/archive.html)
The only reason to avoid libsystemd0 is a cheap way to make sure systemd
paths are not used; some packages (I forgot which) have regressions when
compiled with systemd support as they detect its presence at compile time
rather than runtime.

While libsystemd0 is indeed harmless, there are cases where such a build
profile would be worthwhile:
* utopia stack (policykit and friends) which have a hard dependency on
  systemd
* dependencies on libpam-systemd (including "mere" Recommends, which make
  apt force an init switch or abort an upgrade without a workaround obvious
  to an user who doesn't know what to look for)
On the other hand, rebuilding with a build profile is useful only for
derivatives.  What about looking for a solution that would help users of
unmodified Debian instead?
-shim is moribund (and never worked right even when it was maintained),
thus installing it on systems with modular inits is damage.  I believe this
is the problem that should be solved first -- because all non-trivial cases
mentioned above use logind or an equivalent, and to implement a profile you
need to know what alternate dependency to use.
The name I hear the most is elogind, but other options also get mentioned.
It'd be good if someone more knowledgeable could say more; I think multiple
Debian derivatives are experimenting here.
Once such a solution is chosen, implemented and tested, only then it'll be
time to fix dependencies -- inside Debian rather than some derivative.
Meow!
