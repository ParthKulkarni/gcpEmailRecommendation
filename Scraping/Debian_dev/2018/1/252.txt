  Description     : library for multidimensional numerical integration
The Cuba library provides new implementations of general-purpose
multidimensional integration algorithms.
While several algorithms are available for reliable one-dimensional
numerical integration in modest time --see, e.g., QUADPACK from the
GNU Scientific Library (GSL)--, the situation is less satisfactory for
multidimensional integrals. The Cuba library offers a choice of four
independent routines for multidimensional integration based on very
different methods (both deterministic and Monte Carlo): Vegas, Suave,
Divonne, and Cuhre. These algorithms are a significant improvement
over alternatives already present in Debian (e.g., see the traditional
Monte Carlo method and the Vegas and Miser adaptive algorithms from
the GSL).
A previous version of the library, libcuba3, was already in Debian but
has been removed because ancient, RC buggy and low popcon [1].
I will maintain the package as a frequent user, and will ask support
from a sponsor (a first package version will be uploaded on Debian
Mentors [2]).
