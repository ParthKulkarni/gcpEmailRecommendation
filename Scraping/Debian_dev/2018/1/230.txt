Oh, right, I somehow ended up thinking the LSB init script bits from
lsb-base were part of sysvinit, but they aren't.

If you look at the version graph at https://popcon.debian.org (leaving
out intermediate versions):
    1.28 (sarge)              : 16
    1.41 (etch)               : 740
    1.46 (lenny)              : 2442
    1.49 (squeeze)            : 7912
    1.56 (wheezy)             : 27436
    total submissions         : 195697
This makes about 20% running wheezy or older releases.
