  Description     : 3d model libraries for KiCad's Pcbnew editor
Pcbnew is a powerful printed circuit board software and part of the
KiCad suite.
The 3d models are intended to be rendered by the Pcbnew 3d viewer or
other MCAD software. These 3d models are completely optional and not
really needed for developing any PCB layout but they give a great
possibility to see how your PCB would look like.
A downside of the 3d models are the size of each model. That's one of
the reasons for this ITP, the current available 3d models are that big
to be packaged in the existing kicad-common package and a own source
package is easier to handle in the long term.
The package will be maintained in the pkg-electronics-team together with
Jean-Samuel Reynaud (maintainer of the daily build PPA for Ubuntu).
We will try to keep the package the same in Debian and Ubuntu. More Co
maintainers are welcome!
