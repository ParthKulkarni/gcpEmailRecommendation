"nosystemd" doesn't require a build profile. If you don't want systemd
installed, you can install sysvinit or another init system instead, and
remove systemd.
Building without *libsystemd*, on the other hand, *is* invasive,
precisely because libsystemd *already* includes the necessary code to
handle systems without systemd, and building without libsystemd
duplicates that code. The correct response to a patch to build without
libsystemd is "no, that's what libsystemd exists for".
(If someone feels like inviting flames upon themselves, I'd suggest
retitling this bug to s/nosystemd/nolibsystemd/, to make it clearer what
the request is.)
