I asked 389-ds-base upstream about their plans, and got this draft plan
of getting rid of bdb from Fedora:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pkubat/Draft_-_Removing_BerkeleyDB_from_Fedora?rd=User:Jstanek/Draft_-_Removing_BerkeleyDB_from_Fedora
as for 389-ds-base, there is https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/issue/49476
for tracking the progress (not really started yet).
