As you have been already told by several people, Debian supports
systemd-less systems.  If you find bugs running in this mode, please
file bug reports.
Apart from that, I don't see that you managed to describe what a
"nosystemd" profile would actually do.  This would be the least we would
need from such a bug report.
However what I see is, that you and others instead of actually engaging
in discussions just referred to personal attacks.  I and others consider
this unacceptable behaviour on our technical mailing lists and our bug
tracker.  Please be adviced that I will ask both the BTS owner and the
list masters to block you from ever posting again if this behaviour
continues.
As I don't think anything new will come up, I'm closing this bug report.
Don't reopen it, this might just expedite your fate.
Kindly regards,
Bastian
