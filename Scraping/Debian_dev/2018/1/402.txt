  Description     : Terminal Interface Construction KIT
This library provides an abstracted mechanism for building interactive
full-screen terminal programs. It provides a full set of output drawing
functions, and handles keyboard and mouse input events.
.
Using this library, applications can
.
 * Divide the terminal into a heirarchy of nested, possibly-overlapping
   rectangular windows
 * Render output content and react to input events independently in any
   window region
 * Use fully Unicode-aware string content, including non-BMP, fullwidth
   and combining characters
 * Draw line-art using Unicode box-drawing characters in a variety of
   styles
 * Operate synchronously or asynchronously via file descriptors, or
   abstractly via byte buffers
 * Recognise arbitrary keyboard input, including modifiers*
 * Make use of multiple terminals, if availble, from a single
   application
.
The following terminal features are supported (depending on terminal
support):
.
 * Many rendering attributes; bold, italics*, underline, reverse, strikethough*, alternate font*
 * 256 and 24-bit (16million) colours*
 * Mouse including mouse wheel and recognition of position reporting greater than 224 columns*
 * Arbitrary scrolling regions*
This is going to be a dependency of neovim, once required functionality
finishes being implemented.  It will replace the libtermkey usage in
neovim.
