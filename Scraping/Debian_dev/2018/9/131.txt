  Description     : Topological sorting with grouping support
 This package allows one to create containers for topologically
sorting a list of nodes with    non-circular interdependencies.
.
In the field of computer science, a topological sort or topological
ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such
that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes
before v in the ordering.
