This seems fine, though it would be nice if it wasn't needed, i.e., if
the presence of a README.Debian in a package was flagged to the user as
package metadata.  Such that the presence of the file is enough, rather
than having to add the file and a note in the package description.  But
we don't have that yet.  Just a thought.
