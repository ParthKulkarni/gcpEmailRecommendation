My understanding is that there are quite deep social reasons for the
current policy (please note, though, that I was not involved in Debian
when this piece of policy was created; neither was I involved during the
nodejs TC decision).
The current policy protects maintainers and users of less popular
packages from feeling that their package is less important in Debian,
just because something else that is more popular comes along and happens
to use the same name.
The current policy means that the discussion about which package should
use the name begins on neutral ground, without prejudice against the
less popular package.  By requiring that they both change their names if
agreement cannot be reached, the maintainers put on equal footing.
To my mind, this is part of our attempt to be "the universal operating
system".
