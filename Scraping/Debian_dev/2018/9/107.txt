  Description     : Reactive streams implementation for Netty
This library provides a reactive streams implementation for Netty.
Essentially it comes in the form of two channel handlers, one that
publishes inbound messages received on a channel to a Publisher,
and another that writes messages received by a Subscriber outbound.
Features include:
* Full backpressure support, as long as the AUTO_READ channel option is disabled.
* Publishers/subscribers can be dynamically added and removed from the pipeline.
* Multiple publishers/subscribers can be inserted into the pipeline.
* Customisable cancel/complete/failure handling.
This library is a new dependency of async-http-client.
It'll be maintained by the Java Team.
