For Adrian (since you acknowledged non-native English language status):
Ian is pointing out the distinction between “That is a lie” (asserting
the person knowingly intended to communicate a falsehood), versus
alternatives like “That is false” or “That is not true” (which carries
no implication of the person's intention or state of mind).

If you don't want to support a claim that someone is lying, you can
avoid that implication: Just point out that the statement is not true
(and then do as you (Adrian) did to show how you know it's not true).
I hope that helps!
