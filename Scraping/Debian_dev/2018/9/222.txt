The package is team-maintained on

 This package provides the implementation of what is also available as
 a webservice on
  http://glad.dav1d.de/
 to transform OpenGL specs into an API that one can program against.
 It uses the official Khronos-XML specs to generate a GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL
 Loader made for your needs. Glad currently supports the languages C,
 D and Volt.

 The package is not meant for end users and will not be installed
