Even this runs the risk of a user thinking "OK, so now I have a choice
between rewriting existing scripts and installing the -debcompat package;
come on, rewrite scripts, really?!" and getting into the habit of
installing the -debcompat package, putting that into all kinds of
automated installations and local (DarkPAN-style) packages and install
scripts, etc...  and then, months down the road, somebody else wants to
install the other package and it's much more work to rewrite all the scripts
*then*, when they should have been rewritten earlier.
Just a datapoint; I personally do not have any kind of stake in this.
G'luck,
Peter
