If by more flexibility, you mean allowing packages to conflict, I'm all
against it. I would loose trust in Debian.
By the way, forks aren't a problem, it means both packages provides the
same functionality.

fdclone isn't a shell utility, you just start it once, then you use its
ncurse-like interface. Renaming it /usr/bin/fdclone wouldn't be a
problem at all, and would be useful if you need to use /usr/bin/fd,
which may be useful in shell scripts (which means you need a specific
name so that examples one may find online can work in Debian).

I really prefer this over allowing file collisions.
