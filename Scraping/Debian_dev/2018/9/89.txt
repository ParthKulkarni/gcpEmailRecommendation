If we allow conflicts in this case, we disallow users to use both tools
at the same time.
And on multiple-users machines, it is kind of a random what tool they
actually get when they invoke a binary.
I think that is a disservice to our users.
Suddenly getting a sudo clone invoked when you want your build to build
fast is kind of .. suprising.
