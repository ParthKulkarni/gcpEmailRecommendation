  Description     : diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography
 Set of tools to perform diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography of the
 brain in the presence of crossing fibres, using Constrained Spherical
 Deconvolution, and a probabilisitic streamlines algorithm. Magnetic resonance
 images in DICOM, ANALYZE, or uncompressed NIfTI format are supported.
 This package is to complement mrtrix package - the older series of the tools.
 Depending on the vital signs of the old 0.2 series we might like to keep it in
 Debian for reproducibility etc, especially given that 3.x was not yet fully
 released.  That is why new (versioned) source and binary packages
