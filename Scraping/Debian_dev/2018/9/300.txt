I appreciate where your sentiment regarding this issue comes from, but I
think it comes across as a bit snide.
Jeremy has pulled a lot of weight making GNOME a first class citizen in
Debian, and I think you should rather look at it from the perspective
that a DD is spending a lot of time on duplicate work that effectively
ends up being busy work.
No one like epoch bumps but I know Jeremy wouldn't suggest anything
without spending a considerable amount of time putting thought in to it.
Personally I think you should reconsider before shooting off a 'no' so
quickly. And on that note I also agree with you that Debian shouldn't
pay for downstream mistakes, but this is clearly a bit different and a
bit more than that.
