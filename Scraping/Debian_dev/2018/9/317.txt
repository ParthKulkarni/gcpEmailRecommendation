Actually the real issue is that the 20180603 version of
installation-guide migrated to testing while it shouldn't have. It's
that version which is marked as to be removed, so no worry.
At least, https://packages.qa.debian.org/i/installation-guide.html now
says
Updating installation-guide fixes old bugs: #898665
So I don't think we have anything to do about it.
