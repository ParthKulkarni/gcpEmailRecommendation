  Description     : Qt based client for the Ring daemon.
Ring is a free and universal communication
platform which preserves the users' privacy and freedoms.
 .
 * A telephone: a simple tool to connect, communicate and share.
 * A teleconferencing tool: easily join calls to create conferences with
 multiple participants.
 * A media sharing tool: Ring supports a variety of video input options,
 including mutliple cameras and image and video files, and the selection of
 audio inputs and outputs; all this is supported by multiple high quality
 audio and video codecs.
 * A messenger: send text messeges during calls or out of calls
 (as long as your peer is connected).
 * A building block for your IoT project: re-use the universal communications
 technology of Ring with its portable library on your system of choice.
I plan on maintaining this.
