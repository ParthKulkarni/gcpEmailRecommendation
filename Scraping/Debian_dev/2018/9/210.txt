Description     : automatic dictionary switcher for Emacs spell checking
 Auto-dictionary is a minor mode that automatically sets
 'ispell-dictionary'.  It hooks into flyspell's on-the-fly spell
 checking, and extends these checks to also detect language.  This
 package is useful for Emacs users who work in multiple languages.
  .
 Auto-dictionary supports the following languages:
   Catalan
   Classical Greek - ἑλληνικά
   Danish - Dansk
   English
   Esperanto
   French - Français
   German - Deutsch
   Hindi - हिन्दी
   Hungarian - Magyar
   Modern Greek - νέα ελληνικά
   Norwegian Bokmål
   Norwegian Nynorsk
   Portuguese - Português
   Romanian - Românâ, Româneşte
   Slovak - Slovenčina
   Slovene - Slovenian
   Spanish - Español
   Swedish - Svenska

Antoine, does it detect language with per-buffer granularity, or
support mixing languages in the same buffer?  Thanks for mentioning
that you use this software on #debian-emacs :-) P.S. please ping me if
I take more than two weeks to package this
I do not yet use this package and have been manually switching between
languages, which is why I'm motivated to package it.  I plan to
maintain it as part of the Debian Emacsen Team, and the team policy is
here: https://wiki.debian.org/EmacsenTeam/Team
I will require a sponsor for the initial upload.
Regards,
Nicholas
