Quoting Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>:
As long as the full d/ch is in the source package, I'm fine.
On one of my embedded machines changelogs are 2/3 of /usr/share/doc.
E.g. multiple copies of the same changelog for the various binary
packages build from bind9.
The custom kernel package on my device doesn't install docs :~)
