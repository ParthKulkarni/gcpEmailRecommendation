This is fake news.
The latest upstream release was one month ago.
The software is developed and used since 1995.
What will be the development status and usage of the Rust "fd"
in the year 2040?
Or today?
At first sight "find program with different syntax" sounds like some 
package people will want to remove from Debian as obsolete cruft in
a few years.
"bat" from the same author also reminds me of "dog"[1].

For git, node and chromium there were real problems since widely used 
programs took names that were previously used by fringe packages.
One guy on GitHub giving his fringe programs names like "bat" or "fd",
the sane solutions are to either rename or not package.
Making it easy for fringe programs to take over already used names
would cause more trouble that it would be worth.
