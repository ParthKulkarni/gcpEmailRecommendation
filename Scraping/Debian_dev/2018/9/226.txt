  Description     : Simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find
While it does not seek to mirror all of find's powerful functionality,
fd provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.
Features:
 * Convenient syntax: ‘fd PATTERN’ instead of ‘find -iname '*PATTERN*'’.
 * Colorized terminal output (similar to ls).
 * It's fast, often faster than find.
 * Smart case.
 * Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.
 * Ignores patterns from your .gitignore, by default.
 * Regular expressions.
 * Unicode-awareness.
 * Parallel command execution with a syntax similar to GNU Parallel.
 Please note: the executable and the associated manpage were renamed
 from ‘fd’ to ‘fdfind’ because of a file name clash.
