Still, the nodejs case was, at least to a casual observer, only a massive
waste of time and nerves.
Last upload of ax25-node was in 2008, in 2009 it was effectively orphaned,
the TC bug was filed in 2011 and resolved in 2012, in 2015 ax25-node was
removed with "ROM; no activity, open security issues, de facto orphaned"
(the status that was true when the TC bug was filed). In 2017 the previous
TC decision was repealed.
