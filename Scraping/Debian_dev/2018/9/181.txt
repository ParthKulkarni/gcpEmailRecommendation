  Description     : MicroPython runtime for the BBC micro:bit
The BBC micro:bit is a small computing device for children. One of the languages it understands is the popular Python programming language. The version of Python that runs on the BBC micro:bit is called MicroPython.
This package provides a firmware image that can be flashed to the micro:bit that provides the MicroPython REPL and the ability to upload Python scripts for execution.
The MicroPython firmware uses the yotta build tool for build and dependency management, and gcc-arm-none-eabi for compilation.
I plan to maintain this package in the Python Applications Packaging Team.
