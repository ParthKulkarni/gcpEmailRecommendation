You may have a look at the TC ruling for a bit of context for node.

Not answering that question specifically, but for example, chromium was
renamed as chromium-bsu (upstream). chromium-browser used to be
available via /usr/bin/chromium-browser for a while.
I may have missed it, but it looks like you didnâ€™t ask directly the
netgen maintainers (or explicitly CC them during this discussion). Maybe
a first good step is to communicate with them and ask what is their take
on that matter (trying to find a consensus without half of the involved
party may be considered as rude, thatâ€™s probably not your intention).
