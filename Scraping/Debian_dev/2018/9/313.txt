Description: Remote desktop daemon for GNOME using PipeWire
 This daemon enables GNOME to offer remote desktop sharing using VNC
 with PipeWire. It supports both GNOME on X and GNOME on Wayland.
 Remote sharing can be enabled and managed in the GNOME Settings app.
 .
 This feature will not work on Ubuntu until mutter is recompiled
 with the remote desktop option enabled.
Other Info
--------------
The Debian GNOME team intends to maintain this package.
If testing goes well, we would like to install this package by default
in Debian GNOME for Buster since we currently default to Wayland.
Otherwise, at least it will be available as an option for people using
Buster.
Packaging is at
