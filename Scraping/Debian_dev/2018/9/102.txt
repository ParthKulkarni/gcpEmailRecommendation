I am the prospect maintainer of fd-find; thanks for spotting this. I
will ask the current maintainer of fdclone if he's willing to drop the
'fd' binary, keeping only 'fdsh' (upstream installs both as hard links).
Shouldn't this be possible, I'll install the fd-find binary and man as:
/usr/share/fd-find/bin/fd
/usr/share/fd-find/man/man1/fd.1.gz
and provide the convenience symlinks:
/usr/bin/fdfind -> /usr/share/fd-find/bin/fd
/usr/share/man/man1/fdfind.1.gz -> /usr/share/fd-find/man/man1/fd.1.gz
Does this sound reasonable?
