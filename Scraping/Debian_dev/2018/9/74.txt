Totally makes sense.

In my not-so-long life as a Debian package maintainer I encountered the
issue several times, specifically with:
 * [ITP] fd-find: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
   (/usr/bin/fd clashes with package fdclone)
 * [ITP] bat: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
   (/usr/bin/bat clashes with bareos-bat)
 * imv: /usr/bin clashes with renameutils.
   I renamed the binary and manpage to 'imvr'
 * [dropped ITP] spm: https://notabug.org/kl3/spm
   /usr/bin/spm clashes with salt-common
   I ended up dropping the ITP for spm for several reasons.
Sure the number of packages with a binary file clash problem is
relatively small, but I don't think the issue can be ignored.
