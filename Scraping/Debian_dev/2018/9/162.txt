Makes full sense.
Especially sometimes you need to have at least two kernels on system:
the one is running and another security updated new one.
While SSD is still expensive, saving storage is always welcome.

I think it should at least contain the content of one release cycle. (or two?)
E.g. When Buster get released, we sometimes need to check what's been
changed since Stretch.

If there's not much difference when uncompressing xz, I guess it's
good idea to switch to xz for Buster.
Thanks for your idea!
