These are all sensible reasons, and I think the policy has been written
in the way it is after carefully pondering all the options.
However, there are clearly cases where renaming binaries makes several
people unhappy (most likely: the package maintainers, upstream, people
writing scripts, users of different distributions), while not making a
single user happier. This is especially true with low popcon packages
with a small use case intersection.
I find policy too strict on this point, and I would favor it to be
somehow relaxed or allow other options.
