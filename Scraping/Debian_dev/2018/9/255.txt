  Description     : Fortran compiler using the LLVM toolkit
Flang is a Fortran compiler targeting LLVM.
Flang is a Fortran language front-end designed for integration with LLVM and the LLVM optimizer.
Flang+LLVM is a production-quality Fortran solution designed to be co-installed and is fully interoperable with Clang C++.
Flang single-core and OpenMP performance is now on par with GNU Fortran; for certain applications up to 40% faster.
Flang has implemented Fortran 2003 and has a near full implementation of OpenMP through version 4.5 targeting multicore CPUs.
This will be maintained with the LLVM packaging team.
