I've been maintaining netgen lately, and I've been watching the
conversation but not piping up as I'm still comparatively new as an
"only almost nearly" DM [1].
In general I'm open to proposed solutions, so long as it's kept in mind
that netgen is a sufficiently generic name that I doubt this will be the
last instance of collision for the binary. Probably as a result of the
naming problem, nowadays upstream has rebranded the project as NGSolve
[2], of which Netgen is just a component.
Originally my thought was to update the package to install the binary
to, say, /usr/bin/netgen-mesher, and use the alternatives system to
provide a "netgen-binary" as /usr/bin/netgen. However, it was previously
stated this wouldn't be the correct solution, so I don't know.
