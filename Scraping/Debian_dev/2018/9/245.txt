Quoting Aur√©lien COUDERC <coucouf@coucouf.fr>:
I initially named the package elisa, but such a package already  
existed in the
In a similar case, I just renamed the package. There used to be
dino, an "integrated MIDI piano roll editor and sequencer engine",
and there is dino, a "modern XMPP client". I renamed the latter to
"dino-im" (im = instant messaging). All problems solved.
Maybe elisa-music-player? Then it is clear to everyone, that it is
not a reference to Weizenbaums ELIZA, but maybe to "F√ºr Elise"?
Cheers
