  Description     : 3D scene graph C++ framework
 A portable, high level graphics toolkit for the development of high
 performance graphics applications such as flight simulators, games,
 virtual reality or scientific visualization.  Providing an object
 orientated framework on top of OpenGL, it frees the developer from
 implementing and optimizing low level graphics calls, and provide
 many additional utilities for rapid development of graphics
 applications.
This package intends to bring the new stable 3.6 series, replacing 3.4
and 3.2 already present in the repository.
