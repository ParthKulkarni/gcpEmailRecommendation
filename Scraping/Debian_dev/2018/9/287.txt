* Package name    : eclipse-platform-debug
  Version         : 4.7.3
  Upstream Author : Eclipse Foundation, Inc.

  Programming Lang: Java
  Description     : Language independent facilities and mechanisms for debugging with the Eclipse platform
The Debug component of the Eclipse platform defines language independent
facilities and mechanisms for:
 * Launching programs
 * Source lookup
 * Defining and registering breakpoints
 * Event notification from programs being debugged
 * A language independent debug model
 * A language independent debug UI
The Debug component does not provide an implementation of a debugger, it
is the duty of other plug-ins to provide language specific implementations
of debuggers.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required
to transition away from the old src:eclipse package.
