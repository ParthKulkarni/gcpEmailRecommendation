You should never accuse someone of lying unless you are sure that they
know that what they are saying is wrong.
If you can prove that someone is deliberately saying untrue things on
Debian lists, that is abuse which should be reported and stopped.
Report such things to listmaster.
I can see no useful purpose being served by publicly claiming that
some other participant here is lying.
Ian.
