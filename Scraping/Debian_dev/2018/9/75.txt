This is not a bad idea but we should impose some serious restrictions:
 * The basic principle is that the compat name, and the compat
   package, is provided for users and nothing in Debian (even the
   package itself) may use it.
 * Other packages MUST NOT depend on or recommend the -debcompat
   package.  The reasons for this should be obvious.
 * No program (including parts of the same package) should run the
   program by the compat name (by setting PATH, for exmaple).
   This is because PATH settings leak: modern software often calls
   other programs, and even if it doesn't do so now it may do so in
   future.

I think this is backwards.  Also it will result in violations of the
rules I state above.

I am in favour of my "cut the child in half" rule, as a general rule.

Convenience for the amjority needs to be tempered with justice, and
consideration for the future.
