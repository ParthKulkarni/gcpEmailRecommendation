If the packages conflict, though, this is extremely unfriendly to the
users who do want to use both packages.  They cannot use both packages on
the same OS installation, and have to resort to chroots or VMs or
containers, which is a lot of extra complexity.  I'm therefore in favor of
keeping Policy's prohibition on using Conflicts for this case; maybe a
combination of two packages will get lucky and there will be literally no
users who want to use both at the same time, but it's very hard to tell
when that's the case and the failure mode is ugly.
I kind of like the solution of putting the binaries in a different
directory.  This is also a little irritating, since users have to add an
additional directory to their PATH, but they only have to do that once and
it works consistently going forward, and they can still use the other
program.
It's not totally unheard of to have to modify PATH to use a package,
particularly one that wants to use a bunch of very generic command names.
That was always the official way to use MH, for example.
