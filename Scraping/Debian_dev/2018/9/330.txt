  Description     : science-fantasy MMORPG engine
Ryzom Core is a software platform for creating and running massively
multi-user entertainment in a 3D environment over the Internet.
Ryzom Core provides the base technologies and a set of development
methodologies for the development of both client and server code. The
library contains independently reusable network, ai and 3d modules.

I'm not actually sure yet if the software is suitable for debian, but
I'm filing the ITP to avoid duplication of effort and to document any
relevant considerations. It will be packaged as part of the Games Team.

https://ryzom.com/ is almost fully free software: client, server, tools,
and graphics. The audio assets are currently proprietary "as Ryzom has
not determined the copyright nature of those assets" and so is the
official world configuration and data. Assets are c. 8GB uncompressed.
A fully libre world server is in development https://khaganat.net
The NeL library was previously packaged in Debian up to Wheezy.
