  Description     : Numerical simulation pre- and post-processor - standalone SMESH module
 Salomé is a pre- and post-processor for numerical simulations.  It can import
 CAD files in IGES and STEP formats, facilitates component integration in
 heterogeneous systems, and has a user-friendly GUI as well as a Python console
 with all of the platform functionality.
 .
 This SMESH package is a fork by Laughlin Research adding standalone
 functionality as well as support for Netgen 6 and OpenCASCADE 7.
 .
 This package contains the Salomé SMESH module.
This package is a standalone fork of SMESH from the Salome Platform,
which was removed from Debian in 2012 (see #657433.) Eventually it is my
goal to upstream these improvements and reintroduce the Salome Platform, 
but the complexity of it in its entirety is at least an order of magnitude 
more than this standalone package. 
Most importantly, packaging this standalone fork will allow for the
removal of FreeCAD's bundled copy of SMESH. This fork is already
battle-tested in the Conda distribution of FreeCAD.
I plan on maintaining this within the Science Team.
