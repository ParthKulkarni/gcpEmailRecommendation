  Description     : pager tool to use with mysql/psql command line clients
mypager is a command line tool meant to be used as a pager for the mysql
or psql command line clients.
It colorizes the text output for easier reading, and will also
automatically switch to piping to less when the output is larger than
the current terminal size.
It's a single perl script. I've found it almost essential when using
MySQL daily.
The script was made a few years back but I never took the time to
properly package it. (Since you basically have to copy it to ~/bin/)
I've included a debian/ directory in the git repository. Since this is
my first package I'm guessing it's far from perfect
