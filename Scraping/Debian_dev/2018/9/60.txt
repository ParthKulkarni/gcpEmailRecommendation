If there is no way to actually share a file name without breaking the policy,
there is not anything we alone can agree on without involving the whole
community. I have absolutely no intention of stealing the /usr/bin/netgen from
them ;)
I have not asked the netgen maintainers directly, because the proposed package
upload of netgen-lvs would not have a direct impact on that package. Also, I
also consider debian-devel an open forum, assuming they also read here if
interested (probably too naive of me). :)

Absolutely not my intention.
Thanks for pointing it out. You are probably right, but if I were the netgen
maintainer, I could probably just as well think it would be rude to be
contacted to be asked to "share" a file name, when it can be solved without
involving me - and it does not directly impact my package. :)
Thanks again!
Best regards,
Ruben
