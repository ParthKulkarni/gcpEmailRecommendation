I think the way we handled node.js was correct.
It is true that many people were inconvenienced.  But most of those
who were inconvenienced who you are saying shouldn't have been, were
the people who chose the pckage which (i) came late (ii) whose
upstreams were totally inconsiderate.
It is right to impose the costs of an unjust act on those who are
aligned with the perpetrators, and not on the victims.

I think it did create equality in that the inconvenience for each
maintainer/user of the offending packages was similar.
