How popular is the nodejs binary amongst node(.js) users? The advice I
see from the Node community (and the Rust community and the Go community

directly.
It seems the practical use of these interpreters/package managers/etc
seems to be in fulfilling dependencies of other, user-facing tools,
rather than to be used directly. And under that lens, local binary
renaming or putting them outside /usr/bin etc is less disruptive
(because the interface to that is encoded in the packaging of the
dependents).
