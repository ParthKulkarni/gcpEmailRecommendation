I wonder about a mechanism similar to update-alternatives or divert and 
then warn the user on binary name clashes on installing a package and 
offering her to rename one or both. So he can decide whether to have 
that rust based fd or the fdclone based fd command as fd and the other 
one as some other name.
Of course that would break scripts that expect a certain name. But for 
one of the packages the binary name would change anyway, so that happens 
in either case. But still, letting to user choose would mean that 
different installations behave differently. But we have that with 
update-alternatives for certain binaries anyway already.
