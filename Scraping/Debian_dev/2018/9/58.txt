Yes, you are right, when I read it again. What I have been "reading" before is.
 "Two different packages must not install programs with different functionality
 but with the same filenames if they do not declare that they "Conflict:" with
 each other."
But it doesn't say that..
So this means there is no way to provide the upstream executable name without
violating the policy? :( - even when using "Conflict:" wisely.

And it also means that the package pair "nodejs-legacy" and "node" was RC
buggy when the packages were present (jessie I guess)
Does anyone know about other packages this applies for? Any easy way to search
the archive for packages that provide files with the same name?
