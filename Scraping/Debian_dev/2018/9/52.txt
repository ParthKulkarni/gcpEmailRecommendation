stupid idea:
do these scripts (and other consumers of the netgen binaries) actually
use the fully qualified "/usr/bin/netgen" or just an unqualified "netgen"?
if the latter, you might just put the unchanged names into something
like /usr/share/netgen/bin/ and tell users to add to that to their PATH
when running their scripts.
that provides a simple compat layer for out-of-distro scripts.
rdeps in Debian should be patched to use debianized script-names.
