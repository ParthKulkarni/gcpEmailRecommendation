  Description     : a system for operating distributed forums
Syndie is a system for operating distributed forums, offering a secure
and consistent interface to various anonymous and non-anonymous
content networks.
Syndie operates like blogs, newsgroups, and forums.  Authors can post
messages privately or publicly.  Messages are pushed and pulled to and
from archive servers, which are hosted in a variety of anonymous and
non-anonymous networks including I2P, Tor, and Freenet.
Syndie has a long history and is in a way well-known (it even has a
dedicated Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndie).
However, the lack of good documentation and some missing dependency in
major distros, especially I2P, have been keeping people actually using
it.  Now Debian/Ubuntu has i2p/i2pd packages, it's appropriate timing
to package it.
Syndie is a part of the I2P Project, and I am one of the current
upstream caretakers of Syndie.
