  Description     : Puppet datatypes for use of validation
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module provides a set of Puppet 4.4+ compatible datatypes for use of
 validation in defined types and class declarations. The basic idea behind this
 module is to retire puppetlabs-stdlib's validate_XYZ() functions. Unlike
 validate_(), these datatypes can be verified by the parser, instead of being
 validated during compilation.
Note: This is a dependency of icann-quagga, which will be in use in OCI
(OpenStack Cluster Installer), which is a Debian baremetal installer for
OpenStack.
