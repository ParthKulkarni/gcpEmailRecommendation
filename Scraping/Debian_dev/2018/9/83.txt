That's not the typical case the policy serves.  If you don't like the nodejs decision, pick one or more of the TC or nodejs upstream to be annoyed with.  TC could have done whatever they wanted in that case.
Personally, I've been involved in one of these cases that only affected two minor leaf packages and the maintainers worked it out.  The "or both have to rename" part of the policy was a good motivation to try and work something out.
