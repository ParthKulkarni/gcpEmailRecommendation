  Description     : Python library for working with Neurodata in the NWB format
 PyNWB is a Python package for working with NWB files. It provides a
 high-level API for efficiently working with Neurodata stored in the
 NWB format.
 .
 Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N) is a project to
 develop a unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology
 data, focused on the dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a
 large range of experimental conditions.
 I hope to place it under Debian-Science (or Debian-Med?) team
 maintenance.
