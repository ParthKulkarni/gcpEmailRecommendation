  Description     : build tool for C/C++ projects using modular components
yotta is a tool from ARM mbed, to make it easier to build better software with C++ and C by re-using modules. Modules are published to the yotta registry to share them with other people, or re-use them privately in your own projects.
Whenever you build a project with yotta, you first select a yotta target. Targets describe the platform that you're building for (such as an embedded IoT development board, or natively for Linux), and provide all the information that yotta and modules you're using need to configure themselves correctly for that platform.
yotta is the build tool used for the compilation of the micro:bit MicroPython firmware.
I plan to maintain this package in the Python Applications Packaging Team.
