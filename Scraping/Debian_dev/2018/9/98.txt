"I don't think this is correct" is a less confrontational way of phrasing
this that assumes the other person is writing in good faith and just made
a mistake, as opposed to maliciously attempted to deceive people, which is
what both your original phrasing and "this is a lie" (unintentionally, I
assume) implied.
