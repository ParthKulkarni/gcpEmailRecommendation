  Description     : uncompromising Python code formatter
 Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you 
 agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, 
 Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle 
 nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for 
 more important matters.
 .
 Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. 
 Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the 
 content instead.
 .
 Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs 
 possible.
We'd like to use black as part of code review for LAVA and
associated python packages. I'm currently investigating if this
should be maintained by the LAVA team or the Python Modules team.
The package needs a small patch to remove privacy-breaching tracking URLs
from the docs.
