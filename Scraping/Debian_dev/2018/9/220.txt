  Description     : directed and undirected multi-graph library
 Graphlibrary is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for
 undirected and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used
 with them.
 .
 Graphlibrary is not built from scratch, it's based on dagrejs/graphlib.
And it
 is designed as an out-of-box replacement for dagrejs/graphlib.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
Dependency of gitlab 10.x (dependency of dagre-layout). Its a complex
module to be handled in its own package.
