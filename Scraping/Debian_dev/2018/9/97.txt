I agree, no one likes being called a liar, but "This is untrue", "this
is false", and "this is a falsehood" are more neutral than "this is a
lie", because a lie is the product of lying, and lying includes the
intent to deceive and/or mislead.  Better to allow for the possibility
that someone was mistaken or misspoke ;-)
