  Description     : Provisioning technology for OSGi-based applications
The Eclipse Equinox p2 project focuses on provisioning technology for
OSGi-based applications. Although p2 has specific support for installing
Eclipse and Equinox-based applications, it includes a general-purpose
provisioning infrastructure that can be used as the basis for provisioning
solutions for a wide variety of software applications.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required
to transition away from the old src:eclipse package.
