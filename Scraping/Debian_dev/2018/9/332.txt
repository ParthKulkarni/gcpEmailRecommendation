  Description     : create/join network namespaces at login
 libpam-net allows users to be joined into a network-namespace at login. It
 implements two pam modules:
 .
 - pam_newnet.so: users belonging to the 'newnet' group get a new network
 namespace at login.
 .
 - pam_usernet.so users belonging to the 'usernet' group get their own network
 namespace at login. If a network namespace having the same name as the username
 exists, pam runs the user shell in that namespace. If such a namespace does not
 exist, it is created during the login process.
I belive such functionality does not currently exist in Debian. It can
be quite useful however. For example I use it to have a seperate users
who's network access is always forced though a VPN or Tor.
I have started to package libpam-net here:
https://salsa.debian.org/dxld-guest/libpam-net
I plan on maintaining this package myself, I do not expect this to be
too much work as the it is extremely simple (300 LoC).
I need a sponsor.
