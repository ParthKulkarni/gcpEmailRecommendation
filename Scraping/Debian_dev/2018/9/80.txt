Yes, and the I do not think that this is a good idea as we have seen 
with the nodejs fiasco.
It is a fact of life that some packages are more popular ("important") 
than others, and pretending that this is not true does not change it.
The current policy maximizes discomfort for all parts involved in the 
name of creating equality where it does not actually exist, and this 
does not help anybody.
