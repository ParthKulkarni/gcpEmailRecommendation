  Description     : Serving GPRS Support Node for Mobile Networks
OsmoSGSN is the Serving GPRS Support Node: it handles signalling, i.e.
attach/detach of subscribers and PDP contexts for data services.
OsmoSGSN needs to reach the GGSN to establish GTP tunnels for subscribers. It
must have a separate GTP IP address from OsmoGGSN, as mentioned before.
It is needed for data support in the Osmocom mobile network infrastructure, 
and will be maintained in the Debian Mobcom team.
