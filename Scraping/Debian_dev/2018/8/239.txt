  Description     : Virtual RDP channel servers for ogon
 The ogon project is an open source driven collection of services and
 tools mainly written in C/C++ that provide graphical remote access to
 Linux desktop sessions using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It
 supports most modern RDP protocol extensions, bitmap compression codecs,
 dis- and reconnection to sessions and device redirections. ogon is
 compatible with virtually any existing RDP Client.
 .
 Any X11 desktop, weston or qt application can be used as session. Due to
 it's modular design it's easily possible to extend or add features or
 add new backends.
 .
 The ogon channel repository contains code for server side RDP virtual
 channels like clipboard or drive redirection. The channels are Qt based
 and use WTS/OTSAPI for communication with the client. It also contains
 some code common for all RDP channels that can be used to develop new
 and/or custom channels.
 .
 The ogon components will be packaged under the umbrella of the Debian Remote
 Team.
