Part of the open-core challenge I'm afraid. I already spoke with one
"cloud" service provider last week who was willing to follow up to
this thread with an offer to donate whatever storage types are
needed, but we couldn't find documentation explaining supported
storage options for Gitlab *CE* (note the "ee" in those
documentation URLs, they're the same ones I already found). Is it to
be assumed, generally, that Gitlab's Enterprise Edition
documentation is also appropriate for Community Edition deployments?
