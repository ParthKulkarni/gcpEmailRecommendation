  Description     : wrapper to handle "$EDITOR file:lineno"
 All or almost all Unix editors support the syntax of "editor +42 file", to
 open the given file and start with the cursor at line 42.  Alas, the syntax
 programs that output such data use is different: either "file:42: Something"
 or "file:42:1: Something", :1 being a column number.
 .
 This wrapper will recognize such references and call your $EDITOR using the
 + notation.  Thus, once you see an error message, you can copy&paste the
 first word of it without having to manually adjust.  Especially if your
 mouse selection is configured to allow ':', it's a single triple-click
 (L+L+M), and still pretty handy if not.
 .
 If your editor allows multi-open, "e" can also handle pipelines such as:
 * git grep MEOW|e -:
 * make 2>&1 >/dev/null|grep error:|e -::
 .
 Also, because of its short name, it reduces the typing needed to start the
 editor by half if you use vi, by 80% if emacs or jstar -- and that's by far
 the most frequent command an Unix user does.
Such a wrapper is small enough that it might be better to avoid wasting a
separate package just for it -- but then, /usr/bin/e is a namespace grab
that some might object to, thus they might want to not have this package
installed.
