  Description     : X.Org X server -- Sun FFB display driver
This package provides the driver for Sun Creator, Creator3D, and Elite3D
video devices.
More information about X.Org can be found at:
<URL:http://www.X.org>
This package is built from the X.org xf86-video-sunffb driver module.
This driver was previously removed from Debian along with sparc support.
With the sparc64 Debian port, it has become useful again.
I'd like to re-introduce it into Debian to provide support for the
aforementioned video adapters, found in certain Sun Microsystems
graphical workstations.
For the time being, I'd like to maintain it together with the Debian
sparc/sparc64 port team, and if possible, with the X Strike Force at
a later point of time.
Despite being useful only on Sun graphical workstations, the package
builds fine on any architecture, so I think it would be acceptable to
include it on the Debian package servers.
The project hasn't received any upstream updates in a long time,
but was not deprecated and is still supported in recent X.Org versions.
