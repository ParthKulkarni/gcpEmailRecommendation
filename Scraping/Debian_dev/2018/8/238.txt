  Description     : Utilities and misc libraries for ogon
 The ogon project is an open source driven collection of services and
 tools mainly written in C/C++ that provide graphical remote access to
 Linux desktop sessions using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It
 supports most modern RDP protocol extensions, bitmap compression codecs,
 dis- and reconnection to sessions and device redirections. ogon is
 compatible with virtually any existing RDP Client.
 .
 Any X11 destkop, weston or qt application can be used as session. Due to
 it's modular design it's easily possible to extend or add features or
 add new backends.
 .
 The ogon-apps package contains ogon related applications and libraries
 like the ogon message library and command line utility or the ogon
 shadowing utility.
 .
 The ogon components will be packaged under the umbrella of the Debian
 Remote Team.
