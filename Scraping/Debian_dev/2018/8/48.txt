It could. But at the risk there is some mistake involved, or that the
maintainer wasn't aware of it and can work around the issue (can't you?
Is upstream aware of this limitation?). Also, removing software from an
architecture isn't particularly nice, so it should be a manual action
from the maintainer. Please request your package to be removed from the
arch it doesn't build for anymore (bug against ftp.debian.org, use
reportbug) in unstable and britney will migrate that.
