Nearly 3 months ago there was a mass bug filing on packages with dead alioth lists as maintainer. Many of these bugs are still open with no maintainer response
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?include=subject%3Alists.alioth.debian.org;submitter=debian.axhn%40manchmal.in-ulm.de
(note: it appears that the submitter of the bugs tried to usertag them but failed to actually do so)
What should be done about these in the event that the maintainers don't sort it out? is it reasonable to make a NMU promoting the first co-maintainer to maintainer? is it reasonable to make a NMU orphaning the package? (and if-so should the list of co-maintainers be left in place?) In either case should a final warning be sent to the package's co-maintainers?
