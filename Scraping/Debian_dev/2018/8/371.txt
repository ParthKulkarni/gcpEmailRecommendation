  Description     : z/VM cloud management library
 z/VM cloud connector is a development sdk for manage z/VM. It provides a set
 of APIs to operate z/VM including guest, image, network, volume etc.
 .
 Just like os-win for nova hyperv driver and oslo.vmware for nova vmware
 driver, z/VM cloud connector (zVMCloudConnector) is for nova z/vm driver and
 other z/VM related openstack driver such as neutron, ceilometer.
Note: This is a new dependency of OpenStack Compute (aka: Nova), which I'm
about to release (OpenStack Rocky is out next week).
