Dear all,
The BoF has happened, thanks for your participation and all your
valuable input!
Thanks to the Video Team, the BoF recording is now available at [1], and
the html version of the gobby document can be found by following [2].
I did not yet find the time to condense the input from the BoF, but I
plan to do so in the next few days, but I wanted to share the links with
you already.
Best regards,
