  Description     : ogon session manager and RDP server
 The ogon project is an open source driven collection of services and
 tools mainly written in C/C++ that provide graphical remote access to
 Linux desktop sessions using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It
 supports most modern RDP protocol extensions, bitmap compression codecs,
 dis- and reconnection to sessions and device redirections. ogon is
 compatible with virtually any existing RDP Client.
 .
 Any X11 destkop, weston or qt application can be used as session. Due to
 it's modular design it's easily possible to extend or add features or
 add new backends.
 .
 The ogon package is part of the ogon project and contains the code of
 the RDP server and session manager as well as protocol descriptions and
 some command line (helper) utilities.
 .
 The ogon project will be package under the umbrella of the Debian Remote
 Team.
