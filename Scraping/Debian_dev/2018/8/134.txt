  Description     : lightweight tool for automated server bootstrapping
 Shoelaces provides a mechanisms for automating the bootstrapping of servers. It
 serves iPXE boot scripts, cloud-init configuration, and actually any kind of
 plain text.
 Among its main features we can find that:
   - it allows automating the boot script to serve for a given server based
     on its IP address or DNS PTR record.
   - it has a web UI to show the current configurations, and history of
     servers that booted.
   - it uses the Go template language to serve the configurations, allowing
     to customize them with parameters received via GET request.
I am upstream for this tool and plan to be the main maintainer of the package.
The Debian Go Packaging Team will be set as Uploader.
