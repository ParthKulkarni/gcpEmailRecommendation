  Description     : Extensible Open Source CAx program - online documentation
FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for CAD,
MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product
design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, such as
architecture or other engineering specialties. It is 100% Open Source (LGPL2+
license) and extremely modular, allowing for very advanced extension and
customization.
.
This package contains the FreeCAD documentation generated from the project's
online wiki. The wiki is translated into several languages and currently
translation to French and Italian is complete enough, along with English, to
provide several language packages which can be switched between using the
alternatives system.
.
The main documentation is provided in Qt's new help format; the new help
format version can be viewed in conjunction with the Qt Assistant
found in the qt4-dev-tools package or within the FreeCAD application. In
addition, translated PDFs are supplied.
The freecad-doc package previously existed in Debian but was removed May
2016 for DFSG reasons since it was built from precompiled binaries
included in the FreeCAD source. This package uses a local updatable
copy of the FreeCAD wiki in HTML and image form so as to distribute the
preferred source form. An additional improvement I'm glad to announce is
the inclusion of FreeCAD translators' work in the form of the French and 
Italian packages.
I plan to maintain this within the Debian Science Team.
