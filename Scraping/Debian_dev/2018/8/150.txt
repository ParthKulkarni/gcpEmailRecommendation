> I've started a new project to estimate reliability of hard drives and SSD in real-life conditions based on the SMART data reports collected by Linux users in the Linux-Hardware.org database since 2014. The initial data (SMART reports), analysis methods and results are publicly shared in a new github repository: https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART. Everyone can contribute to the report by uploading probes of their computers by the hw-probe tool!

> Please be careful when reading the results table. Pay attention not only to the rating, but also to the number of checked model samples. If rating is low, then look at the number of power-on days and number of errors occurred. New drive models will appear at the end of the rating table and will move to the top in the case of long error-free operation.
Hi,
I've just created a Deb package for hw-probe. See https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-on-debian.
The command to replenish the database:
    sudo hw-probe -all -upload
One can also use a lightweight all-in-one AppImage (Debian 8 and later, Ubuntu 12.04 and later) or Snap package (Debian 9 and later, Ubuntu 14.04 and later) to make a probe of the computer w/o the need to install any Deb packages to the system:
https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe#appimage
https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe#snap
Deb package sources are available in the OBS project: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:linuxbuild/hw-probe
Thank you.
