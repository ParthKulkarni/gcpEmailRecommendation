True.  There might be some general use in may be the following tasks:
   https://blends.debian.org/science/tasks/dataacquisition
   https://blends.debian.org/science/tasks/distributedcomputing
   https://blends.debian.org/science/tasks/statistics
   https://blends.debian.org/science/tasks/typesetting
   https://blends.debian.org/science/tasks/viewing
(or even a subset of these).  I'm not very keen on having these but may
be this could be a topic to discuss.
