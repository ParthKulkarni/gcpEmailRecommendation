Package: general
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
after upgrading to debian testing, I ran into a few problems. First of all, as I am using fluxbox, and intend to continue, I could not use gdm any more - after login, the login screen would reappear after some time. Login to gnome was no problem. I installed lightdm and configured it to use X (instead of wayland). Right now, login is working, and the desktop appears, but only after a pause of up to several minutes which can be shortened by moving the mouse. Afterwards, everything seems to run normal, except: The gimp. On calling "gimp" form the command line, nothing happens. When using "strace gimp", the program starts; yet, opening jpg images is not possible (freeeze), the preview creation fails as well.
I do not know whether these bugs are related; somehow, as all of them are about starting programs, with strange measures to overcome at least the first obstacles (mouse movements, strace-call) I somehow suspect it.
Sincerely yours,
		Moritz
