  Description     : client for Function as a Service for OpenStack
 Qinling (is pronounced "tʃinliŋ") refers to Qinling Mountains in southern
 Shaanxi Province in China. The mountains provide a natural boundary between
 North and South China and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife, some
 of which is found nowhere else on Earth.
 .
 Qinling is Function as a Service for OpenStack. This project aims to provide a
 platform to support serverless functions (like AWS Lambda). Qinling supports
 different container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes/Swarm, etc.) and
 different function package storage backends (local/Swift/S3) by nature using
 plugin mechanism.
Note: This is a new dependency of Mistral.
