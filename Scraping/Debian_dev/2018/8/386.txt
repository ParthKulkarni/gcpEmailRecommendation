I'm afraid that's still a huge overestimation of gopher's usefulness,
and it's not fit for any task but trolling our kind of folks...  but
that never stopped anyone from writing such software.    And in Debian,
"useful" is defined as "someone bothered to work on it".
Because you're a DM and will need a sponsored upload to NEW, I demand it to
be done the right way!  Since #880649 dget supports gopher:// URLs.  :)
Meow!
