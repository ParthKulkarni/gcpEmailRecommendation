  Description     : [Thunderbird Add-On] Sync contacts, tasks and calendars to
thunderbird. Currently supporting Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) and sabre/dav
(CalDAV & CardDAV)
Synchronize Exchange ActiveSync accounts (contacts, tasks and
calendars) to Thunderbird, supports Office 365, Outlook.com,
Freenet, Strato, Hotmail, Kopano and other EAS compatible servers.
This package helps to connect to calender and contacts which are provided by a
server named above.
It has a similar functionality to calendar-exchange-provider which doesn't work
any more with thunderbird >=60
I use it myself. I will do the package as I did it with calendar-exchange-
provider.
