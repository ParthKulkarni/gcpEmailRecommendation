  Description     : Java API for XML based RPC (JAX-RPC)
JAX-RPC is an API for building Web services and clients that used remote
procedure calls (RPC) and XML. Often used in a distributed client/server
model, an RPC mechanism enables clients to execute procedures on other
systems. In JAX-RPC, a remote procedure call is represented by an XML-based
protocol such as SOAP. The SOAP specification defines envelope structure,
encoding rules, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls
and responses. These calls and responses are transmitted as SOAP messages
over HTTP.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team. It partially replaces
