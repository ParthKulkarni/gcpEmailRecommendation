  Description     : high-dimensional medians in Python
 Various definitions for a high-dimensional median exist and this Python
 package provides a number of fast implementations of these definitions.
 Medians are extremely useful due to their high breakdown point (up to
 50% contamination) and have a number of nice applications in machine
 learning, computer vision, and high-dimensional statistics.
 .
 This package currently has implementations of medoid and geometric
 median with support for missing data using NaN.
 .
 This is the package for Python2
