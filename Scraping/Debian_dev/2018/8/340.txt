"Therefore, the no-sale restriction imposed by Commons Clause means that
any software under this new license is non-open source by definition.
However, in practice, Commons Clause only adds a limitation concerning
fair use, and we believe that both licensing approaches share the same
core value of making software available for use by anyone."
