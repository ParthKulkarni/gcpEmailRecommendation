  Description     : C++ library for working with GDSII binary data files
libGDSII is a C++ library for working with GDSII binary data files, intended
primarily for use with the computational electromagnetism codes scuff-em and
meep but sufficiently general-purpose to allow other uses as well.
It is a recommended dependency for the newest version of meep.
The plan is to maintain it in the Electronics team.
