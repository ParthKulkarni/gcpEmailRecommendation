  Description     : tool for finding visual differences between two font versions
 fontdiff is a utility for testing fonts. When you modify a TrueType or
 OpenType font, fontdiff generates a PDF showing the typeset text both
 before and after the change. You can use this PDF to easily review the
 changes and spot any errors caused by a font switch.
 .
 For every line in the text sample, the tool renders two raster images in
 high resolution. One image is typeset using the original font, and the
 second uses the new font. If there is any difference between these two
 high-resolution images (even if itâ€™s just whitespace caused by kerning
 changes), the output PDF highlights the difference in color.fontdiff is a
 utility for testing fonts. When you modify a TrueType or OpenType font,
 fontdiff generates a PDF showing the typeset text both before and after

I plan to maintain this package within the Fonts packaging team.
The package is useful as a standalone tool, but I plan to integrate it
in the build process of fonts-hack as a QA step comparing the Debian
built font to the upstream released one.
The source is shipped with convenience copies of many third-party
libraries. It will have to be repacked.
