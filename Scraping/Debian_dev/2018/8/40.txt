  Description     : SOAP with Attachments API for Java - Reference Implementation
The SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) provides the API for creating
and sending SOAP messages by means of the javax.xml.soap package. It is used
for the SOAP messaging that goes on behind the scenes in JAX-WS, JAX-RPC,
and JAXR implementations. SOAP Handlers in JAX-WS use SAAJ APIs to access
the SOAP Message. Developers can also use it to write SOAP messaging
applications directly instead of using JAX-WS/JAX-RPC.
The package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to build
the JAX-WS reference implementation. JAX-WS was previously embedded
in the JDK but will be removed in Java 11.
