Thanks for bringing it up, Jonas! I absolutely agree with your reasoning
and I also think that it conflicts with Debian's Social Contract; hence
I'd like to see this discussed before silently implementing such a thing.
While I understand the simplicity of using $company's cloud storage, I'd
rather not rely on some external company and in particular not on this
one. This company does not exactly represent what I would call ethical,
non-proprietary, and decentralized.
Are there no partners that would kindly provide such storage to Debian
(Gandi?). Sometimes this may take more time, and be harder to implement.
It might be more expensive, and that's exactly the point: whenever
something is free, you've become the product.
Cheers,
Ulrike
