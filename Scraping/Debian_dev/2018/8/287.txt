Sorry for the inconvenience.  Please get in touch with Launchpad staff
(which happens to include me) about this.  If you give us the OOPS ID
that should have been part of the message you received, then we can fix
up whatever's wrong with your account, and then you can use the ppc64el
builders in our build farm.
The details of this won't be on-topic for debian-devel of course, but
you can contact us at feedback@launchpad.net, or #launchpad on freenode.
