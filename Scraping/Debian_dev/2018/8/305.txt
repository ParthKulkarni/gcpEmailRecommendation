ccdiff is a colored diff that also colors inside changed lines.
All command-line tools that show the difference between two files fall short
in showing minor changes visuably useful. ccdiff tries to give the look and
feel of `diff --color` or `colordiff`, but extending the display of colored
output from colored deleted and added lines to colors for deleted and addedd
characters within the changed lines.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
