  Description     : Portable FPGA place and route tool
This is a place and route tool with GUI for FPGAs. It is closely related to
fpga-icestorm and provides similiar functionality as arachne-pnr, but intended
to be more general. Upstream is quite active with a number of developers, and
it is possible that it may more or less "replace" arachne-pnr in the future.
I intend to maintain it in the Debian Electronics team.
