  Description     : tool to remove comments from Python scripts
Nudatus is a tool to remove comments from Python scripts.
It was created to help squeeze longer programs onto the micro:bit
but it should be suitable for various environments with restricted
storage.
Nudatus was designed to be embedded within a greater tool
(e.g. uflash [1], mu-editor [2]) but also provides a CLI tool.

I plan to maintain this package in the Debian Python Modules Team.
