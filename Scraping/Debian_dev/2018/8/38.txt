  Description     : WS-Policy implementation in Java
Metro Policy is the WS-Policy implementation for the Metro Web Services
stack.
WS-Policy is a specification that allows web services to use XML
to advertise their policies (on security, quality of service, etc.)
and for web service consumers to specify their policy requirements.
The package will be maintained by the Java Team. It's required to build
the JAX-WS reference implementation. JAX-WS was previously embedded
in the JDK but will be removed in Java 11.
