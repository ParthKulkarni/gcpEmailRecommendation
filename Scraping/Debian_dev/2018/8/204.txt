To me, none of the above.

I very much do not agree with this. The full software stack used by the
provider *MUST* be free as well. I have made a full talk at Debconf
explaining why it is important, I would appreciate if you could have a
look to the video.

I very much agree with this, and I kind of feel we're all gamed into
using Salsa, and then it moves to using non-free solutions. And I'm not
even going back to the previous thread where Alexander wrote he would
*never* switch to a packaged solution. That one as well, is an
unilateral decision.

It's more than this, unfortunately. After we've all been invited to
migrate to Salsa, and all spent time on it, now it's partly non-free. If
I knew it would go this way, it's possible that I would have chosen
another place to host my Debian work. Possibly self-hosting it.

Do you really trust this? I don't...
Also, have we ever thought that Google is completely banned in China?
Can users in China access the data? If it's direct access to things
hosted by Google, then the answer is probably that it's also blocked.

As I mentioned in my talk at Debconf18, there's 18 listed public cloud
providers using OpenStack here:
https://www.openstack.org/marketplace/public-clouds/
OVH, CloudWatt, Rackspace, Vexxhost, and also probably the company I
work for (Infomaniak) are potential candidates for sponsoring storage,
and all of them are using free-software hosting platforms.
I also don't understand why we're not attempting to build a Ceph cluster
at UBC. Why not?
Cheers,
