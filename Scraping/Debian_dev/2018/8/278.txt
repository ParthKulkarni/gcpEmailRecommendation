Please report those problems separately, as bugs in the relevant packages,
and use reportbug to provide information about the relevant package. We
cannot do anything to help you with only the information that there is
a problem, and any replies to this bug are likely to mix up several
related or unrelated issues.
If these problems all have the same root cause, we can easily merge
their bugs, but if they have different root causes, disentangling one
bug number that refers to several bugs causes extra work for maintainers.
Only report multiple issues as a single bug if you have evidence that
their root cause is the same, for example if downgrading a single package
causes all of those issues to disappear.

Please report this as a gdm3 bug, and attach or quote the messages
that appear in your system log (/var/log/syslog or the systemd Journal)
when this happens.

Please check the system log (/var/log/syslog or the systemd Journal)
and report this as a lightdm or fluxbox bug, whichever seems more likely
to be the cause.

If you have the libopenblas-base package installed, please try removing
it. If that succeeds, then this is <https://bugs.debian.org/903514>.
If you have packages from deb-multimedia.org installed (in particular
libbabl-0.1-0), please use Debian packages instead. deb-multimedia.org
appears to be distributing versions of various libraries with an
artificially higher version number than the correct version in Debian,
and those libraries do not provide the functionality needed by gimp.
Otherwise, please report this as a new gimp bug.
Thanks,
