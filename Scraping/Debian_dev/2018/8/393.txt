  Description     : KIM API is an Application Programming Interface for atomistic simulations
The KIM API is an Application Programming Interface for atomistic simulations.
The API provides a standard for exchanging information between atomistic simulation
codes (molecular dynamics, molecular statics, lattice dynamics, Monte Carlo, etc.)
and interatomic models (potentials or force fields). It also includes a set of library
routines for using the API with bindings for:
  FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95, Fortran 2003
  C, C++
Atomistic simulation codes that support the KIM API work seamlessly with the KIM-compliant
interatomic models (KIM Models) distributed on this website. The interface is computationally
efficient and often requires relatively minor changes to existing codes.
