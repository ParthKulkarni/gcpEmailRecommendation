A side effect of these bugs is a query: "is anyone still maintaining this?".
Thus, it feels really wrong to NMU to falsely claim so.
Unlike single-person maintainers where there's MIA (which still doesn't
detect a person active elsewhere but neglecting the package), there's no
real way to detect an AWOL team.  Except this.
Thus, we have a nice list of no longer active teams.  That's good, we should
make this happen more often.
So, what about sending a warning now then orphaning in, say, 3-6 months from
now?
