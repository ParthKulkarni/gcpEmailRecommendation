  Description     : 2D Voronoi diagram library with CAM focus
The OpenVoronoi project aims to produce an algorithm for calculating the 2D 
Voronoi diagram for point, line-segment, and circular-arc sites. Currently
point-sites and line-segment sites work. Arc-sites are being worked on. The 
incremental topology-oriented algorithm is used.
The core algorithm is in C++ with Python bindings using Boost Python.
Voronoi diagrams are used for many purposes in computational geometry, but the 
motivation for OpenVoronoi is mainly been 2D offset-generation for CNC mill 
toolpath calculations for computer-assisted machining. An experimental 
approximate medial-axis filter is included.
This library was recently relicensed from GPL3 to be usable in FreeCAD's Path 
Workbench along with OpenCAMLib.
I plan to maintain it under the Debian Science Team.
Note: A similar library, voro++, is already in Debian, but it wasn't
suitable for Path WB developers' needs as it's primarily 3D- and
cell-based.
