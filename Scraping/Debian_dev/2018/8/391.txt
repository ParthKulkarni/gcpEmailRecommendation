  Description     : Request backlog for IRC channels
znc-backlog is a ZNC module that makes it easy to request backlog. Its
intended use is for when you have just launched your IRC client and gotten
a few lines of backlog sent to you, but want to read more. Instead of having
to deal with shelling into the box where you run ZNC and manually sifting
through the logs, you can issue a short command in your IRC client to request
any amount of the most recent lines of log.
