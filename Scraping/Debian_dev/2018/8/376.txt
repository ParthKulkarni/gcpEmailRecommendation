  Description     : SWUpdate provides a reliable way to update the software on
an embedded system
SWUpdate is a Linux Update agent with the goal to provide an efficient and safe
way
to update an embedded system. SWUpdate supports local and remote updates,
multiple update strategies
It supports the common media on embedded devices such as NOR / NAND flashes,
UBI volumes, SD / eMMC,
and can be easily extended to introduce project specific update procedures.
Pre- and postinstall scripts are supported, and a Lua interpreter helps to
customize the update process.
An update package is described by the sw-description file, using the libconfig
syntax or JSON.
It is even possible to use Lua with a custom syntax.
Here a short list of the main features:
    Install on embedded media (eMMC, SD, Raw NAND, NOR and SPI-NOR flashes)
    Allow delivery single image for multiple devices
    Multiple interfaces for getting software
        local storage
        integrated web server
        integrated REST client connector to hawkBit
        remote server download
    Software delivered as images, gzipped tarball, etc.
    Allow custom handlers for installing FPGA firmware, microcontroller
firmware via custom protocols.
    Power-Off safe
    Hardware / Software compatibility.
It depends from these packages:
        libconfig
        libjson-c
        libcurl
        lua
I am the author / maintainer of this project, and I provide rules to maintain
the package in the sources.
Full documentation for the project is here:
        https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/index.html
Having it in Debian will help people to understand how an update works on
embedded system and it can be simply used on debian for ARM.
