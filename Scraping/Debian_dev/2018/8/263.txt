This is a very difficult problem due to the lack of support for these
devices in the mainline Linux kernel and userspace hardware support.
Things are moving slowly on that front, with most work being done
outside of Debian upstream and in other distros. Please take a look
these pages:

Not all mobile device makers will allow the installation of
alternative operating systems. In particular Apple and Huawei and
probably more are blocking this.

Debian does not do hardware development but there are some folks doing
potentially useful hardware that could run Debian at some point in the
future:
