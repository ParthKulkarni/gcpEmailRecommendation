  Description     : Tool for OpenSSH to use public keys stored in LDAP
openssh-ldap-publickey allows OpenSSH to use public keys stored in the user
attribute 'sshPublicKey' on the LDAP server . Integration with OpenSSH is done
by means of the AuthorizedKeysCommand option and does not require to patch
OpenSSH in comparison to LPK solution. LDAP connection settings can be read
from common LDAP configuration files such as /etc/pam_ldap.conf and
/etc/libnss-ldap.conf.
I'm using this tool quite happily for a few years already on both Debian and
CentOS systems instead of maintaining a patched version of openssh-server with
patches from LPK project and I believe this utility would be quite useful for
the Debian community.
It would be great to maintain the package with the Perl Group as it is written
in Perl though I am not a member of this group.
