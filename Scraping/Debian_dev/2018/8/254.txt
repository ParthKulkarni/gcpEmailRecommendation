  Description     : diff template library written by C++
 dtl provides functions for comparing two sequences of arbitrary
 types. Sequences must support a random-access iterator.
 .
 The algorithm dtl uses is based on the paper "An O(NP) Sequence
 Comparison Algorithm" (1989) by Sun Wu, Udi Manber and Gene Myers. The
 computational complexity of Wu's O(NP) Algorithm is O(N+PD) on average,
 and O(NP) in the worst case.
This will be a simple package installing only some C++ include files.
It is a dependency of fontdiff (ITP #906099).
