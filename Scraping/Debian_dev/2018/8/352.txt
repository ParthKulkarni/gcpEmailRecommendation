  Description     : Gnuradio blocks and tools for receiving DAB and DAB+ radio
gr-dab contains necessary DSP blocks for receiving DAB and DAB+ transmissions
using a software defined radio such as hackrf, rtl-sdr, USRP etc.
Currently, I plan to maintain it myself, but it may also fit in the Hamradio
Maintainers Team with other GNU radio packages.
