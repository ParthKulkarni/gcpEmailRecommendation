Dear Tobias,

Thanks for moving forward with your proposal. I'll have a poke at the
Etherpad in the upcoming days or so.
Whilst you outline a plan of sorts, do you have any rough timetable
in your head that you would like to share? That might help focus or
motivate deeper discussion to some degree.

Combined with post-Debconf tiredness/bluesâ€¦
Best wishes,
