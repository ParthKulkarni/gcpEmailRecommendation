We don't rely on it. There will be a backup on debian infastructure so that
we will be able to change to different providers at every time. 
Additionally its only subsidiary data. Git is and will be only on debian
infrastructure. If you don't use lfs or ci, you are safe (whatever safe
means). 
But using gce allows us to to support use cases different use case than just
git (like lfs, build artificats, build logs and so on) without consuming IO
on debian infrastructure (we are already seeing IO problems on high traffic). 
Hope that helps
