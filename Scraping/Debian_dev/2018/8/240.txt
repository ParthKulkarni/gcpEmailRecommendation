  Description     : Qt5 platform abstraction plugin based backend for ogon
 The ogon project is an open source driven collection of services and
 tools mainly written in C/C++ that provide graphical remote access to
 Linux desktop sessions using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It
 supports most modern RDP protocol extensions, bitmap compression codecs,
 dis- and reconnection to sessions and device redirections. ogon is
 compatible with virtually any existing RDP Client.
 .
 Any X11 desktop, weston or qt application can be used as session. Due to
 it's modular design it's easily possible to extend or add features or
 add new backends.
 .
 This is a Qt5 platform plugin to export applications through ogon
 without modifying the original code.
 .
 This package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Remote
 Team.
