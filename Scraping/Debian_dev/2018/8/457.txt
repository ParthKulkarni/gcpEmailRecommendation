  Description     : minimalistic media manager
  m keeps track of which files you've played (or are still playing)
  and thus allows you to easily continue playing the next file (using
  vlc or mpv).
I'm the upstream author and I use it a lot myself (instead of kodi);
some of my friends do as well.  As a Debian user I wanted to be able
to install it as a Debian package, so I turned it into a native Debian
package.  It builds (reproducibly) using dpkg-buildpackage.
I'm hoping to eventually become a Debian Developer/Maintainer, but for
now I'd need a sponsor to get this into Debian.
Thanks.
- Felix
