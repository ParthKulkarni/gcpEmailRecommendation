- Draft on the etherpad: Sunday, Aug 19th
- Discussion period on this draft: 2 weeks, until Sep 1st.
- Adapting texts to the input received: until Sep 9th
- Review on -devel until Sep 16th
- Proposing patch to dev-ref: until Oct 1st.
- In parallel:
  - creating patches/texts for dev-ref.
  - creating a wiki page for the details.
