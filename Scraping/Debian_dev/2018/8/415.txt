  Description     : Angular UUID XStatic support
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data
 files from external projects, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. It provides
 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
 .
 Angular-uuid is an AngularJS wrapper for Robert Kieffer's node-uuid, which
 provides simple, fast generation of RFC4122 UUIDS. It features:
 .
  * AngularJS service â€“ no global scope pollution
  * Generate RFC4122 version 1 or version 4 UUIDs
  * Cryptographically strong random num generation on supporting platforms
  * Tiny file size when minified.
