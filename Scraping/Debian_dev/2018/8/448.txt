I just upload a minor version of Sphinx. Since I am not a heavy Sphinx
user or developer,
I guess I don't have enough knowledge to continue maintain it.

So the current 2.2.11 that is in debian repos is a software without support (we offer help to sphinx users, but this goes inevitable to switch to manticore,as we did a lot of progress since we forked and doesn't make sense to maintain older versions). Our fork is gplv2 (as the original project) and we continue from where the last open source version left.

We did some upgrades to our compiling scripts, as now it uses cmake and can generate packages. In the past, there wasn't much attention on distros packages (as we offered them on software website) and there was only a ppa maintained, but we want to bring manticore to distribution repositories to make it easier for users.

I guess guys on debian-devel may have a interesting.
Hi, Debian folks,
Who is heavy sphinx search user and have willing to maintain manticore?
If so, just pick up this package.
