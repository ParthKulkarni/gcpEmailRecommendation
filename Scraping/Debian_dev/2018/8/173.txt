FWIW I'm not sure -devel is very likely to be read by the people who'd
have useful input for you, you may want to reach out to a more narrow
list or group of people instead.
For what it's worth, I don't think pam_xauth is a good idea in the su
pam config.  (I don't think copying DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY was, either.)
