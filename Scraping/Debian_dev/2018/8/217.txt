I had actually tried that on a whim with some of the EE documents I
found last week, but I guess I tried it on the wrong ones. In
particular
https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/lfs/lfs_administration.html#storing-lfs-objects-in-remote-object-storage
does seem to confirm CE supports whatever Fog does, so pretty much
anything in that case. Thanks!
(Also, no need to Cc me, I've been subscribed to and at least skim
most everything which passes through this list for something like
two decades now.)
