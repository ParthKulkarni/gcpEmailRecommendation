 The Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library (PEGTL) is a
 zero-dependency C++11 header-only parser combinator library for
 creating parsers according to a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG).
 This is actually version 2 of
 https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pegtl (which is version 1.3.1), but it
 is incompatible with version 1 because the file extensions changed from
 .hh to .hpp and the include path is now /usr/include/tao and thus the
 package name also changed, so me and muri (who packaged the version 1)
 figured it would be better to create a new package. There is only one
 build-dep on version 1 (usbguard), which switched to version 2 of
 tao-pegtl in its last upstream version.
 (I hope this approach is oke)
 I plan to maintain this package myself, keeping debianization in
 following Git repository:
