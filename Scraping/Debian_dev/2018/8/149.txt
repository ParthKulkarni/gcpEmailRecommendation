  Description     : CAS server library for Django
   CAS Server is a Django application implementing the Central Authentication
   Service (CAS) Protocol version 3.0 specification.
 - Why is this package useful/relevant?
    A Django client for CAS already exists in Debian
    (python-django-casclient), however, there does not appear to be a
    python-based  CAS server available.
 - Is it a dependency for another package?  No.
 - Do you use it?  Yes.
 - If there are other packages providing similar functionality, how does it
 compare?
    The package lemonldap-ng is written in perl and supports CAS.  It is
    a very full featured, standalone SSO system.   However it (in my
    opinion) is a little too complex for simple environments.  In
    contrast, django-cas-server can simply plug into an existing Django
    deployment with little difficulty (and fewer features).
 - How do you plan to maintain it?
    I am willing to join the Debian Python Module Team and maintain it under
    that umbrella.  However, if it doesn't make sense for me to join the
    team for one package, then I'm willing to maintain it by myself.
    Either is acceptable to me.
