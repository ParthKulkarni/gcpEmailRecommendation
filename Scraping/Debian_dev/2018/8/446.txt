If you're intending to maintain this package in Debian, you should file
an "Intent to Package" bug[1]. After that, you can follow the processes
on mentors.debian.net[2][3] to request sponsorship of your package.
For this library specifically, I suspect you might have luck engaging
with the Debian Multimedia Team â€” they address your type of request in
their team-specific FAQ[4].
Thank you for your contribution to Debian!
Cheers,
Luke Faraone
