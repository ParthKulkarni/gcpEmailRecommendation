There certainly are a few things like disabling network access during build or
seccomp filters which schroot in Debian cannot yet do (see also #802849).
But before re-implementing all the package building logic that already exists
in pbuilder and sbuild, could we maybe evaluate whether it is feasible to
extend the existing tools with a new backend?
Especially when added as an autopkgtest-virt server, such work would benefit a
much bigger crowd than yet another [1,2] package building software.
I would certainly appreciate a bug against sbuild that adds functionality that
sbuild does not yet have.
Thanks!
cheers, josch
