 Debian8.7 was overwritten by 8.8, 8.8 was also overwritten by 8.9... and
 now we provide 8.11 as Debian8. Debian8 = Debian8.x, x is latest point release.
 So, 8.7's EOL is when 8.8 was released but Debian8 itself was not EOLed
 at that time.
 Now Debian8 is end of regular support term and move to LTS
 (see https://wiki.debian.org/LTS). Debian8 user should update to 8.11 and
 get update from LTS with no change to its settings.
 With each point release, there's a changelog for it, so you can dig
 differences.
 See https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian8.11/ChangeLog
 And, debian-devel is not appropriate for support channel or user questions,
 please use debian-user mailing list.
