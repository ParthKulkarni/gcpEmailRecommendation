  Description     : A JavaScript unit test framework for Thunderbird and Firefox
JSUnit is a Mozilla addon targeted for addon authors to allow for unit
testing of JavaScript components.  It provides a command line
interface to run unit tests in installed applications like Firefox and
Thunderbird.
Please note: JSUnit is a test tool; it is not recommended for
production environments, as it modifies various configuration settings
that slow down your application for daily use!
---
This is useful for running the full test suite for Enigmail
(e.g. during build time, or in autopkgtest).  It is not something that
a normal user will want to have installed on their machine.
