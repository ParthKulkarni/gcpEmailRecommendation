It has previously been permitted to update Firefox extensions to a new 
upstream version in stable when a Firefox update requires this (e.g. 
#826896).  Are you proposing to prohibit this, or observing that it 
doesn't always happen?
15 of 82 xul-ext-* packages have updated to a new upstream in stable at 
least once in either wheezy, jessie or stretch; I don't know whether the 
others didn't need to or or are/were broken.
Of the 7 I checked (the Debian-specific one plus ones I'd heard of, so 
probably above average), 1 (pdf.js) is now part of the browser, and the 
other 6 all support WebExtensions upstream.  Of their Debian packages:
- 3 have unanswered open requests to do so (adblock-plus #889712, 
noscript #882287, greasemonkey #895315)
This 1 is the only webext-* package that replaces a xul-ext-*; the other 
4 such packages appear to be newly packaged extensions.
