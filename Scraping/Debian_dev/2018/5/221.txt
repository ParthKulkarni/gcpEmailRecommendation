Hi 
I'm packaging libuv1 and I'm facing an unusual issue.
On my ryzen system the following test fails:
not ok 295 - udp_dual_stack
# exit code 6
# Output from process `udp_dual_stack`:
# Assertion failed in test/test-udp-ipv6.c on line 181: recv_cb_called == 1
This test fail for libuv1 1.11.0 1.18.0 and 1.20.3 ( I did not go further 
back)
On the other hand, this package builds fine on an Intel proc and an older AMD 
(proc bought around 2010)
All these machine are Debian/sid amd64 and were updated today.
My Ryzen is AMD Ryzen 7 1700X Eight-Core Processor with hyperthreading.
Could someone test this build on their Ryzen system ? (I'd rather have a 
confirmation from other people before logging upstream this kind of bug).
All the best
