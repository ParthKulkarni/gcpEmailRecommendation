  Description     : An unofficial program to manage Minecraft instances
with ease
MultiMC is a free, open source launcher for Minecraft. It
allows you to have multiple, cleanly separated instances of
Minecraft (each with their own mods, texture packs, saves, etc)
and helps you manage them and their associated options with a
simple and powerful interface.
About a year ago, I submitted an ITP for MultiMC 0.5.1 (#861615),
but there were a few blocking issues. The main one, copyright,
has been fixed upstream, and I think I've fixed the smaller
ones. I'm submitting a new ITP under a new email which I
intend to use for further Linux-related development. If this
is an issue, I can close this issue and go back to the other
ITP.
Since this is my first package, I will be needing a sponsor.
I'm going to post the package to mentors very soon; it builds
and runs, I just need to do some finishing touches (fix some
lintian issues).signature.asc
