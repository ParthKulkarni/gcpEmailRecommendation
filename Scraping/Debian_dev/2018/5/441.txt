  Description     : Polyglot is a command-line tool for counting lines of source code and detecting languages.
Polyglot is a command-line tool for detecting languages within projects. It
allows users to quickly assess an unfamiliar project, and it allows projects to
track complexity over time. It is dramatically faster than similar packages such
as cloc, and it disambiguates file types better than cloc in some cases.
I currently use this tool on all of my own repositories. I would need a sponsor
in order to upload it.
