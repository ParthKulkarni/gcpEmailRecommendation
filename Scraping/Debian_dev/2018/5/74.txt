I gave an example link to python3.6 which worked at the time of writing,
but of course (that how it goes) changed by an new upload. python2.7
seems to show one: libgnatcoll (bug filed: 895235)

Just add it as a test dependency in one of your tests?

No, it's all manual and currently I am doing most triaging (bunk and
ginggs have contributed multiple bugs as well). The last couple of weeks
I was able to file most bugs before the short expiry of 5 days, now with
15 days the task gets easier. If error messages and output are clean,
this isn't so difficult. However, quite often output is hopeless for a
bystander and difficult to judge the root cause and the severity. I hope
we can improve this in the future by pointing people to the right tools
(do they exist (for all languages)?) such that output gets standardized
a bit more than currently.
