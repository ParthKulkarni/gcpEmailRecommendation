Well, you're pushing at an open door with me with the "patches
welcome" call to arms :)
But is there not value to even the smallest test here? I've caught
a ludicrous number of idiotic mistakes in my packages and code in
general with even the dumbest of "smoke" tests.
Indeed, the return-on-investment versus clever tests is often
scary and that's before we start trading clichÃ©s such as "the
perfect is the enemy of the good" etc. etc.

(I note that these are statistics about packages that actually have
tests.)
Best wishes,
