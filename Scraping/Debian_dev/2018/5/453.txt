* Package name    : libjavolution-java
  Version         : 6.0.0
  Upstream Author : Javolution
* URL             : http://javolution.org/
* License         : BSD-2-clause
  Programming Lang: Java
  Description     : Java core library for real-time and embedded systems
 Javolution real-time goals are simple: To make your application faster
 and more time predictable!
 .
  * High-Performance - Hardware accelerated computing (GPUs) with
    ComputeContext.
  * Minimalistic - Collection classes, supporting custom views, closure-
    based iterations, map-reduce paradigm, parallel computations, etc.
  * Optimized - To reduce the worst case execution time documented
    through annotations.
  * Innovative - Fractal-based structures to maintain high-performance
    regardless of the size of the data.
  * Multi-Cores Ready - Most parallelizable classes (including
    collections) are either mutex-free (atomic) or using extremely short
    locking time (shared).
  * OSGi Compliant - Run as a bundle or as a standard library. OSGi
    contexts allow cross cutting concerns (concurrency, logging,
    security, ...) to be addressed at run-time through OSGi published
    services without polluting the application code (Separation of
    Concerns).
  * Interoperable - Struct and Union base classes for direct interfacing
    with native applications. Development of the Javolution C++ library
    to mirror its Java counterpart and makes it easy to port any Java
    application to C++ for native compilation (maven based) or to write
    Java-Like code directly in C++ (more at Javolution C++ Overview)).
  * Simple - You don't need to know the hundreds of new Java 8 util.*
    classes, most can be built from scratch by chaining Javolution
    collections or maps. No need to worry about configuration,
    immutability or code bloating !
