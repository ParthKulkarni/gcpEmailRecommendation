Hello!
We are currently having a hardware problem with our fastest SPARC machine,
the SPARC-T5, such that the machine is currently offline.
Since this server is rather powerful, it is hosting several virtual machines,
including four buildd instances, the sparc64 porterbox (sakharov), a NetBSD
test VM, a Solaris VM and a Debian sparc64 porterbox available for upstream
projects.
Thus, with the machine being offline, we lost an important backbone to
Debian's sparc64 port. We luckily still have enough slower sparc64 machines
available which are running as buildds and one Sun Fire 2000 which can
be set up as a porterbox.
However, since the SPARC-T5 is much faster than the other machines (gcc-8
builds in an hour as compared to 22 hours on the Sun Fire 2000), we are
trying our best to get the machine back into service. We also have a
second SPARC-T5 with similar hardware issues that we might be able to
restore.
Any support to help the machines back into service is appreciated.
Thanks,
Adrian
