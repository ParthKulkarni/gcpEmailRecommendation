  Description     : a pythonic wrapper around FFTW, the speedy FFT library
pyFFTW is a pythonic wrapper around FFTW, the speedy FFT library. The
ultimate aim is to present a unified interface for all the possible
transforms that FFTW can perform.
Both the complex DFT and the real DFT are supported, as well as on
arbitrary axes of abitrary shaped and strided arrays, which makes it
almost feature equivalent to standard and real FFT functions of
numpy.fft (indeed, it supports the clongdouble dtype which numpy.fft
does not).
Operating FFTW in multithreaded mode is supported.
pyFFTW is BSD-licensed and should not be confused with python-fftw, a
GPL-licensed python module with the same aim of provider python
bindings to FFTW3. Or python-gpyfft, which provides bindings to the
OpenCL FFT library clFFT.
This package will be maintained by the Debian Science maintainers (who
also maintain FFTW3 itself and python-gpyfft)
