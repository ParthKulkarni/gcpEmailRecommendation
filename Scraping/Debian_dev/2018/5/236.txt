  Description     : manipulate DICOM files in Octave
Digital communications in medicine (DICOM) is an information standard, originally created for image transfer, which now deals with a large range of medical data.
This package provides functions to read and (eventually) write DICOM files in Octave, a scientific computation software. The functions in the package are intended to have similar usage as the dicom functions in the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox. In Octave they are separate: most image package users will not use dicom, and its dependency might be considered troublesome.
This package will be maintained in the realm of the Debian Octave Group.  A preliminary version of the package can be built using git-buildpackage from the repository https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-octave-team/octave-dicom.git
