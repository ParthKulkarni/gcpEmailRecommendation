* Package name    : r-cran-base64url
  Version         : 1.3
  Upstream Author : Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>

  Programming Lang: GNU R
  Description     : GNU R fast and URL-safe Base64 encoder and decoder
 In contrast to RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with
 "-", the 63rd character ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the encoder
 does not fill the string with trailing "=". The resulting encoded strings
 comply to the regular expression pattern "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are
 safe to use in URLs or for file names.
 The package also comes with a simple base32 encoder/decoder suited for
 case insensitive file systems.
Remark:  This package is a precondition to fix bug #882371 which needs
packaging of r-cran-batchtools which in turn needs r-cran-base64url to
build.  It will be maintained by the R pkg team at
