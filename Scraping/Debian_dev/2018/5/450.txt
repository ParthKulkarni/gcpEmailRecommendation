  Description     : Node.js handler for LemonLDAP::NG WebSSO system
Lemonldap::NG is a complete Web-SSO system that can run with reverse-proxies
or directly on application webservers. It can be used in conjunction with
OpenID-Connect, CAS and SAML systems as identity or service provider. It can
also be used as proxy between those federation systems.
It manages both authentication and authorization and provides headers for
accounting. So you can have a full AAA protection. Authorizations are built by
associating a regular expression and a rule. Regular expression is applied on
the requested URL and the rule calculates if the user is authorized.
Lemonldap:NG is already packaged in Debian (lemonldap-ng).
node-lemonldap-ng-handler provides the Node.js handler. It can be used
to replace lemonldap-ng-fastcgi-server or to protect an Express app.
This package will be maintained under JS-Team umbrella.
