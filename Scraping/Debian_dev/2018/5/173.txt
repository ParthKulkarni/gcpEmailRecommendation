Description: system daemon to manage thunderbolt 3 devices
 Thunderbolt 3 features different security modes that require
 devices to be authorized before they can be used. The D-Bus API can be
 used to list devices, enroll them (authorize and store them in the
 local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled
 devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
 removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
 authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called
 boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above
 mentioned tasks.
Other Info
--------------
Required for GNOME integration with Thunderbolt. Initial GNOME Shell
support is in GNOME 3.28 (in Buster). The GNOME Settings
(gnome-control-center) integration will be in GNOME 3.30 which is
scheduled for release in September.
See https://christian.kellner.me/2018/04/23/the-state-of-thunderbolt-3-in-fedora-28/
Not many people have Thunderbolt 3 devices yet, so if you do, please
let us know how well this feature works.
Initial packaging was done by Sebastien Bacher in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
I intend to help maintain this package under the Debian freedesktop.org team.
Packaging is at
