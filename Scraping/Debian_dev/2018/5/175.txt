  Description     : OpenStack virtual network service - BGP-based VPN
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
 .
 Driver and agent code to use BaGPipe lightweight implementation of BGP-based
 VPNs as a backend for Neutron.
Note: This package is a build-dependency for networking-bgpvpn, itself needed
to do gating in puppet-openstack upstream.
