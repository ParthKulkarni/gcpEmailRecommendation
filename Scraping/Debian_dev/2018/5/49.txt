  Description     : Runtime environment for Java applications like Hibiscus
Serves as a base framework for recurring tasks on Hibiscus.
Keeps a unified look & feel. Strictly separate program and
user data. Supports synchronous and asynchronous data exchange
via between plugins (via messaging) and allows client server
communication via RMI, XML-RPC and SOAP. Comes with headless
mode (no GUI for servers) and logging.
This project is base for Hibiscus, I ITPed in #690874.
I'm planning to maintain jameica as part of the java-team.
