I was wondering if you want headers to the e-mail I will send out. I
guess this is what you want, so, can you do a proposal (I have never
really worked with those, so I don't have much inspiration and I don't
really see what you want to achieve).
In the e-mail I also provide a boiler plate for forwarding the e-mail to
the BTS. You could also have meant that you wanted headers there. I
guess that is not what you meant.
