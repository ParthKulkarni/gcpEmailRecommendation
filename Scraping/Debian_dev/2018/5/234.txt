Package: wnpp
Severity: wishlist

Visual Studio Code regularly comes up in discussions.  Several GSoC
students have asked about using it for Python projects.
Upstream releases[1] the source code under an MIT license on Github
They also distribute binary versions that may or not be built from an
identical code base and contain other (non-free) license clauses.  The
differences are discussed[2] in Github.  It is suggested that the
difference between the source and binary version is like the difference
between chromium and chrome.
Various people have commented about the product sending[3] telemetry
data to the upstream but it is not clear if that happens if it is built
from the source but presumably that can be patched.
The FAQ also mentions[4] auto-updates, that also appears to be something
that would be unexpected for a package user.
There is some background information[5] about the product on Wikipedia.
Any feedback about the suitability of this software as a package or the
use of this software for free software development in general and
alternatives (whether packaged or not) would be welcome.
Regards,
Daniel
