I meant something differently than one can easily read in my words. What
I mean (biased by stuff I do at work) is that it is easy to generate
reference data for your test and to check the current output to that.
This is great to bootstrap a smoke test, but often they are too
sensitive to changes and also trigger on progression. Selecting the
piece of the reference data you care about and testing only against that
is what I meant with "smart".

I rather have tests than no tests. For sure. We can fix bugs in them,
sure. What I wanted to at least have said once is that one can also make
them easily too poor. I'll stop warning about that ;)

That is why I said "a bit". But if one knows how many packages there
are, one can get the ratio. By the way, I would for myself only look at
the passing part because a large part of the FAILS have never passed and
thus are nearly worthless for the bystander.
