  Description     : OpenStack Integration Test Suite - Horizon plugin
 Tempest is a set of integration tests to be run against a live Openstack
 cluster in order to make sure that all components are working as expected.
 Tempest will start and stop virtual machine in order to check that your
 cloud is working as expected.

 This package contains the OpenStack dashboard (aka: Horizon) plugin.
This package is used by the puppet-openstack functional test suite, which
I'm currently porting to Debian. It's going to be used in upstream CI.
