Hi,
Frankly, I don't see the point in writing this kind of software. Sbuild
works super well with the overlay backend, and already has throw-able
chroots in tmpfs. Adding docker into this doesn't add any new feature,
and in some way, is less flexible than the already existing sbuild.
Instead, I very much would prefer a patch to puiparts so that it could
use sbuild's schroot system instead of tarballs.
Cheers,
