This is a new dependency of Smokeping introduced in the 2.7.2
release. I would love for the perl team to just carry this one, as I
will probably have no other use for it.
dh-make-perl seems to do a decent job with it, and i intend to upload
this to unstable or experimental when i figure out how to un-mess the
smokeping package.
