Hi Paul,

Just some brief and somewhat-pedantic suggestions for improvements
below. Beyond that, I'd love to see some parsable X-Foo: headers. I
find these very helpful in the BTS's mails to reliably file things
in my email setup.

I've been big Unicode fan ("... ever since the release of their 1980

difficult to read/parse in the middle of text with my particular
combination of typeface, font size, antialiasing and screen resolution.
Either that or I'm getting old.
