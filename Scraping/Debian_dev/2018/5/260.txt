  Description     : falling blocks game with many different game modes
Galois is a computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with
unique features. Unlike most other games of that type, it is not
limited to blocks made of four two-dimensional, square bricks: you can
choose among several different brick shapes, blocks composed of more
or fewer bricks, and even between two- and three-dimensional games.
This package may replace ghextris which will possibly be removed from
Debian because it depends on python-gtk2 which is going away. But even
if ghextris is saved, I think Galois would be a valuable addition on
its own, as it has many game modes that no other Tetris-like game has.
I am the upstream author and I commit to support the Debian package
too. I need sponsoring and plan to seek it from the Debian Games team
-- I've already written to debian-devel-games and got encouraging
feedback.
