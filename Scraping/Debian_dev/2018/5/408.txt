There is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/
It has currently 10,712 issues and 595 merge requests.
About the issues: Open: 10,712  Closed: 25,941  All: 36,653
MR:  Open: 595   Merged: 15,906  Closed 2,696  All: 19,198
That tells me that a Merge Request has a better success ratio.
Also that it is wise to keep notes of the MR number  :-/
