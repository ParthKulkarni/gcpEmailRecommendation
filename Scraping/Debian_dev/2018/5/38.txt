  Description     : Mckoi SQL Database System written in Java
Mckoi SQL Database is an SQL (Structured Query Language) Database
management system written for the JavaTM platform. Mckoi SQL Database is
optimized to run as a client/server database server for multiple
clients, however it can also be embedded in an application as a
stand-alone database. It is highly multi-threaded and features an
extendable object-oriented engine.
This project is a dependency of Jameica/Hibiscus, I ITPed in #690874.
I'm planning to maintain mckoisqldb as part of the java-team and pushed
an initial version to salsa:
