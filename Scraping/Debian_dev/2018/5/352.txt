  Description     : Run go programs as a service on major platforms.
 service will install / un-install, start / stop, and run a program as a
 service (daemon).  Currently supports Windows XP+, Linux/(systemd | Upstart |
 SysV), and OSX/Launchd.
 .
 Windows controls services by setting up callbacks that is
 non-trivial. This is very different then other systems. This package
 provides the same API despite the substantial differences.  It also can be
 used to detect how a program is called, from an interactive terminal or
 from a service manager.
