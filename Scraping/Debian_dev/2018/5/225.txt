  Description     : daemon/library for Linux that temporarily optimizes system for gaming
daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to
request a set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS
The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
(gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
with the same clients.
GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with the
Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to be
expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
automation tasks one might want to apply.
I intend to maintain this in the debian-games team on salsa.
