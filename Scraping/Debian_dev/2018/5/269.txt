Hello debian-devel,
IIRC do we agree that feedback is good.

Yeah, that is where the pain is, the spot that needs improvement.
I think we have all been there:
 Encounters with a software bug,
 feeling the need to report it,
 but not knowning _how and where_ to report.
We shall never know how many times people _choose to not report_.
In #898394 we did get report of a possible software bug,
filed against package "general".
What can we do better to get bugreports^Wfeedback
at the right place?
