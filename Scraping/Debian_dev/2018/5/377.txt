  Description     : GNU Readline-like line editing module
 A Python module that provides `GNU Readline`_-like line editing functions (the
 default Emacs-style ones). If you just want to use Readline, use the readline_
 package in the standard library--but this package allows access to those
 capabilties in settings outside of a standard CLI.
 .
 Currently, all stateless Readline commands are implemented. This means that
 yanking and history are not supported.
 .
 This module is especially well-suited to interfacing with Urwid_ due to a
 shared syntax for describing key inputs.
I was planning on maintaining through the Debian modules packaging team.
This is a dependency of hangups, a console mode Google hangouts client.
