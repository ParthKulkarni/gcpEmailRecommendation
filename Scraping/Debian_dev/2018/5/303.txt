  Description     : Fibra provides advanced cooperative concurrency using Python generators.
"cooperative" concurrency, that's something like concurrency according to
Windows 95, if that's enough for you, cooperative concurrency prevents
such problems as closing a database object from within a Thread that
did not open it.
bauble 1.0.56 (I was just informally handled package ownership by
cate@debian.org) depends on this library, and I would not want to include
it in bauble, I'd rather make it an independent package.
I'm not aware of other modules that provide the same functionality,
and the version number (0.0.17) is more an indication of how fast
it was developed and how quickly it became mature.  I don't think it
will require any maintainance, but if upstream produces a new version,
I don't see any problem in staying tuned on the pypi page.
