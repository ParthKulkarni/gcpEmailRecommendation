  Description     : Automatic Learner of Decision Trees
The AI::DecisionTree module automatically creates so-called "decision trees"
to explain a set of training data. A decision tree is a kind of categorizer
that use a flowchart-like process for categorizing new instances. This
implementation uses the gain obtained at each node in order to figure out
what are the most useful informations in order to take decisions.
This module is not developed anymore but it nicely does what it was
written for.
It is a suggestion for AI::Categorizer that I plan to package within Debian
Perl Team.
