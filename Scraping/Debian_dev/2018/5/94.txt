I have had a complaint about my e-mail, boiling down to it should be
opt-in. I am not fully convinced (as I fear too many package maintainers
will miss the fact their autopkgtest delays another package, but I want
to start sending the e-mails to
dispatch+$package_contact@tracker.debian.org. How does that sound? Are
there other/better options?
