I use this package for $work so I'm planning to help here. Here is
what I'll be doing, time permitting:
1. Migrate source away from alioth to salsa
2. Package new composer dependencies: sql-parser, motranslator,
shapefile, recaptcha.
3. Update phpmyadmin
I've started (1) by creating a phmyadmin-team on salsa, and will push
my work over there.
