  Description     : A command line image viewer intended for use with tiling window managers
imv is an image viewer for X11 and Wayland, aimed at users of tiling
window managers. It supports a wide variety of image file formats,
including animated gif files. imv will automatically reload the current
image, if it is changed on disk.
Debian hasn't a great choice of modern, interactive image viewers that
play well with tiling window manager. The package that is the most
similar to imv is sxiv, which is based on the legacy imlib2
Enlightenment library and has no Wayland support.
I plan to maintain the package within the PhotoTools team.
