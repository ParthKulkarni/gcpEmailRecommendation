  Description     : Plugin for sudo that requires another human to approve and monitor privileged sudo sessions.
sudo is used to run commands as privileged users, but on some sensitive systems,
you really want to ensure that no individual can act entirely autonomously. This
plugin enforces that no user can act entirely on their own authority within
these systems, by requiring a separate auditor to monitor the interactive sudo
session.
