  Description     : CAM program & Python library for generating toolpaths
 PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3 axis machines. The generated
 GCode can be used with LinuxCNC and other machine controllers.
 The included Python library can be used independently from the GUI.
 .
 Features:
    * read and write STL model files (3D)
    * support for 2D models (DXF/SVG/PS)
    * generate toolpaths (GCode) for various strategies and drill
          definitions
    * manage and store processing templates
    * scale, move, rotate, flip and transform the model
    * interactive 3D model view based on OpenGL
    * non-interactive generation of GCode via commandline
    * render single-line fonts (provided by QCAD)
This package is useful and relevant because it performs a job that is
underserved in the open source world: computing CNC tool paths from 2d
and 3d models.  It is similar to the debian package dxf2gcode, but also
handles 3d models.
I am a casual contributor to the upstream project.  I have developed
debian packaging for pycam which is included in upstream, and distributed
from the linuxcnc.org debian archive:
http://linuxcnc.org/dists/stretch/base/binary-amd64/
I want to transition the debian package into the official Debian package
archive.
I am motivated to maintain the debian package, like i have maintained
the dxf2gcode package.  I plan to work with the Debian Science team,
which has sponsored my dxf2gcode package.  I hope that the Science team
will sponsor the upload of this package as well.
