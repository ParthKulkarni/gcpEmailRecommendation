Thanks.  That is quite a clear report with a helpful link, indeed.

I hadn't realissed that _test_ dependencies would trigger retests, as
well as actual package dependencies.
Doing as you suggest for a real test feels wrong, since it involves
denormalising (in the relational database sense) the dependency graph.
But I guess I could introduce a test which does nothing, but which has
as direct dependencies the indirect dependencies I want to be retested
for.  It's a bit of a bodge but if we invented a feature name for this
test it would even give us an upgrade path:
  Tests: some-empty-shell-script
  Depends: indirect-dep-1, indirect-dep-2
  Features: hint-indirect-dependencies-retest
And then if we later add a more `proper' way of saying the same thing,
it can understand this old way of writing it.  Or we can ignore it if
we have a better way of doing the same thing later.

For my part I'm sorry that the output from autopkgtest itself is not
always easy to navigate.
But, anyway, thanks for your effort, but it obviously doesn't scale to
have the central infrastructure team triage things.  How easy would it
be to have the CI automatically send an email to the maintainers of
the rdependency and the dependency ?
I think we need to get into the habit of the maintainers talking to
each other about these kind of things, before we start increasing the
blocking time.  Otherwise we risk developing a culture where the
dependency's maintainers usually do some kind of workaround, which the
rdependency's maintainers may find out about much later if at all.
