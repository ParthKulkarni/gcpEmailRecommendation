  Description     : Simple mime type detection
 Marcel attempts to choose the most appropriate content type for a given
file  by looking at the binary data, the filename, and any declared type
(perhaps passed as a request header).
 .
 By preference, the magic number data in any passed in file is used to
determine the type. If this doesn't work, it uses the type gleaned from
the filename, extension, and finally the declared type. If no valid type
is found in any of these, "application/octet-stream" is returned.
 .
 Some types aren't easily recognised solely by magic number data. For
example Adobe Illustrator files have the same magic number as PDFs (and
can usually even be viewed in PDF viewers!). For these types, Marcel
uses both the magic number data and the file name to work out the type.
