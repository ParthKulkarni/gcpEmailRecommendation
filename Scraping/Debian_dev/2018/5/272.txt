I don't think you really addressed my request: Which specific packages
have been removed from Testing solely because of gconf that you
believe should be in Buster and what is the reason they can't be
ported away from gconf this year?
By the way, I did announce the gconf removal on this list in February.
[1] Respectfully, you are the only one complaining about gconf's
removal.
It is not a service to our users to keep old libraries and software
around for additional Debian releases just because someone somewhere
might use some of it for something.
