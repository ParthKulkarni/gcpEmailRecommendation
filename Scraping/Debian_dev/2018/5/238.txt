  Description     : a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit™ games
OpenJazz is a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit™ games.
.
Jazz Jackrabbit™ is a PC platform game. Produced by Epic Games (then Epic MegaGames),
it was first released in 1994. The fast-paced, colourful gameplay proved popular,
and the game won PC Format's Arcade Game of the Year award. Many people still fondly
recall the shareware versions.
.
With the demise of DOS-based operating systems, it has become necessary to use
emulators to play old DOS games. Jazz Jackrabbit™ deserves more - and would benefit
greatly from new features.
.
To play, you will need the files from one of the original games.
I have put g-d-p in CC, because (a) proprietary game data will be
necessary to actually play the game. There is a shareware version
available for free (beer) download and GOG has just re-released all
available versions in a single package. Furthermore, (b) we will have to
decide on a file system location for the game data that both g-d-p use
to install the data files and that openjazz uses to search for these
files.
