  Description     : A plugin for Vagrant which manages entries in the hosts file for guests and, optionally, the host system
>From the project description: vagrant-hostmanager is a Vagrant plugin that manages the hosts file on guest machines (and optionally the host). Its goal is to enable resolution of multi-machine environments deployed with a cloud provider where IP addresses are not known in advance.
Without using a plugin like this, host entries must be managed manually - especially when using dynamic IP allocation. Host entries in guests could be managed by provisioners in Vagrant files, or possibly some type of dnsmasq configurations. These options are either labour-intensive or complex.
There are some other vagrant plugins that provide similar functionality, such as vagrant-hosts (https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-hosts) which is limited to static IPs. From what I've seen, there are no packages presently in debian that offer similar
I don't know ruby particularly well, nor the internals of vagrant plugins. I plan to maintain the package by following upstream releases.
I will need a sponsor for the package.
Thanks,
Kienan
