  Description     : Graphic user interface to interact with KuttyPy
 KuttyPy is a USB interfaced board that gives you an option to do such
 things like to switch a light bulb, rotate a motor or measure a
 temperature under software control, in pure Python.
 .
 Playing with LEDs, motors, switches etc. is the primary objective of
 this hardware, but the experience gained in manipulating the 32
 Input/Output pins of this board will gradually make you familiar with
 the ATMega32 micro-controller.
This utility offers a glimpse into the brain of the
processor, and allows students to fiddle with it in real time.
I believe this can be exciting for a high school audience.
The autor of kuttypy-gui, Jithin B.P., has also authored the
package eyes17 (part of the debian package exepeyes) which I
maintain since year 2012. I shall keep maintaining both of them.
One remarkable point is that the kuttypy board, like eyes17 board,
is free hardware, designed in the spirit of frugal technology.
