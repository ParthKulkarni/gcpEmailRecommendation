Hello!
I've spent the last months preparing MariaDB 10.3 for Debian. I am
almost done, but there are a bunch of smaller issues I need help with.
I would be glad for anybody who can look into the issues and give
solution ideas - or even file a merge request on Debian's Gitlab
instance where the Debian development happens:
https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/MySQL/patches
Git repository for the packaging:
https://salsa.debian.org/mariadb-team/mariadb-10.3
Bugs filed against MariaDB in Debian:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?repeatmerged=no&src=mariadb-10.3
There are a few ones tagged newcomer friendly as well!
Build status in Debian (for porters!):
https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=mariadb-10.3
Please pick something that is close to your expertise and help out if
you can! :)
- Otto
