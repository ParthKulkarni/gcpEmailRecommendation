  Description     : Command-line interface for Nitrokey devices
nitrocli provides a command-line interface for Nitrokey devices.
The Nitrokey Pro provides an OpenPGP smart card, one-time password
generation (HOTP and TOTP) and a password safe.  The Nitrokey Storage
additionally provides hardware-encrypted storage.
nitrocliâ€™s functionality is similar to that of nitrokey-app, which is
already packaged for Debian.  Yet nitrokey-app has a Qt-based user
inface while nitrocli has a command-line interface.  nitrocli and
nitrokey-app are both based on libnitrokey.
I intend to package nitrocli within the Rust packaging team.
