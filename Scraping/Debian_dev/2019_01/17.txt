Have you tried an LXC autopkgtest instance?  I've noticed that
sometimes packages whose tests pass 100% of the time with a schroot
(buildd profile) will fail on debci, and the only way I've been able
to reproduce the failure is with an LXC autopkgtest.
I will confess to not knowing why this is the case...but I've had
success with resolving failing tests in debci by debugging
LXC+autopkgtest failures.
Good luck, and I look forward to following this thread!
Happy New year,
Nicholas
