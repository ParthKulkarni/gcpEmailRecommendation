Dear Debian,
Unicode, Inc. has informed me that they just added the directory
http://www.unicode.org/ivd/data/ to the list of directories explicitly
mentioned as covered by their license; see
http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html#License.
Among other files, that directory contains IVD_Sequences.txt, which
emacs (among other packages) uses.  The license ambiguity for that
file had been a concern for someone.
All the best,
Paul Hardy
