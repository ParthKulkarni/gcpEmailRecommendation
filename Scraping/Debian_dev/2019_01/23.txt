  Description     : A webkit2-based web browser extensible by Lua
Luakit has been part of Debian up to and including stretch.  It was removed
from sid recently because the version in Debian depended on Webkit1.
Upstream, however, had ported the software to Webkit2 by then.
I would like to bring back the modernised luakit to Debian.
The description of the old package by and large still pertains (although
I give you it would be spiced up a bit): Luakit is a highly configurable
browser framework based on WebKit2GTK.  It is very fast and extensible
by Lua.  It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any
people with too much time on their hands who want to have fine-grained
control over their web browser's behaviour and interface.
