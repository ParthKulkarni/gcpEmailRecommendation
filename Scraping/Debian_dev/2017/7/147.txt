I am specifically addressing the middle-tier users:  those who have some
knowledge, are manually configuring the machine for some reason, but are
not professional sysadmins.  Neither the naive user nor the professional
sysadmin will be bothered by either choice, but I believe that there is
a significant population of Debian users (and Linux users in general)
that fall into the tech-hobbyist category, for whom this is an important
issue.

Okay, I had a look on a six-weeks-before-release stretch VM, and I don't
see anything there that makes this easier than with the udev .rules
file.  There is still no skeleton .link file that already has the
appropriate attributes already filled in.  It looks like I still have to
create a .link file and manually type the appropriate attributes.  Am I
missing something?
BTW, there seems to be a typo in the man page:  it refers to a
/run/systemd/network directory; should that be /run/systemd/netif/links?
I'll leave you to file a bug if appropriate.

I don't get this at all.  The previous behavior was neither unreliable
nor unpredictable (unless you are talking about much older systems
before persistent-net.rules).  What change is surprising?  The change
between jessie and stretch?  Absolutely.
You have completely sidestepped the question, which is about the
relative importance of the two goals, simple names _all the time_ vs
avoiding a state file.  The previous behavior sacrifices the second,
much less important goal in favor of the first.  The new behavior
sacrifices the first in favor of the second.  Until you address this
issue, all your explanations look like attempts to ameliorate bad
behavior.
