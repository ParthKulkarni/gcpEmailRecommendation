Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I intend to orphan the sendxmpp package.
The package description is:
 sendxmpp is a perl script to send XMPP (jabber) messages, similar to what
 mail(1) does for mail. XMPP is an open, non-proprietary protocol for instant
 messaging. See www.jabber.org for more information.
Unfortunately, I cannot give it the help it needs since I do not use
Jabber myself. The package is very useful if you want to send messages
to a Jabber service via the command line. However, it suffers from
several RC bugs which need attention. Upstream is also not very active.
If noone steps up, I will file a RM request in the current release
cycle.
