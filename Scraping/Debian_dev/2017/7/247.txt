  Description     : Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air
 vim-airline provides a themable vim status bar that makes use of the
 powerline font. It's similar to vim-powerline, but is still maintained
 and much simpler since it user pure vim configuration instead of
 scripting languages.
 .
 Some of its features:
 .
  * Tiny core written with extensibility in mind
  * Integrates with a variety of vim plugins
  * Looks good with regular fonts and provides configuration points
    so you can use unicode or powerline symbols
  * Optimized for speed; it loads in under a millisecond
