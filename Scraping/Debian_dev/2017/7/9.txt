  Description     : Mocking library for requests
 This library allows unit tests to provide mocked responses to HTTP requests
 made using the 'requests' library, either conditionally using the
 'urlmatch' decorator or for all requests using the 'all_requests'
 decorator.
I'm aware that this covers similar ground to 'responses', which is
already packaged as python-responses/python3-responses.  They have quite
different APIs so it's not in general trivial to substitute one for the
other, though; I find myself packaging this because it's a test
dependency of https://pypi.python.org/pypi/macaroonbakery, which I also
intend to package, and I also use it in some other unpackaged code.
I intend to maintain this within the Debian Python Modules Team.
