  Description     : Gettext Style i18n for Modern JavaScript Apps
 If you don't specifically need a gettext implementation, look at
MessageFormat
 instead, as it has better support for plurals/gender and has built-in
locale
 data.
 .
 Jed doesn't include a Gettext file parser, but several third-party parsers
 exist that can have their output adapted for Jed.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This library is a dependency of gitlab
