  Description     : OpenStack SDK for Go
 Gophercloud allows Go developers to connect their applications with
 OpenStack clouds. It is fully open source and supports many OpenStack
 services like Compute, Object Storage, Identity, Networking and
 Block Storage.
It's the new dependency for packer.
I will package this inside pkg-go team and need sponsor as well.
Additional info:
There's golang-github-rackspace-gophercloud in Debian archive, upstream is
https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/
gophercloud/gophercloud is considered as a successor of rackspace/gophercloud,
whoes feature was freezon.
In https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/issues/592, maintainer of
rackspace/gophercloud says the library will be migrated
gophercloud/gophercloud, and gophercloud/gophercloud are almost entirely
backwards-compatible. However the two libraries do have incompatible interface[1],
and they are both used in many projects[2][3].
So I think we can package this package as a new one. The golang import path for
them are different, and they can coexist together.
