  Description     : NTLM Implementation for Go
 This is a native implementation of NTLM for Go that was implemented
 using the Microsoft MS-NLMP documentation available at
 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc236621.aspx. The library is
 currently in use and has been tested with connectionless NTLMv1 and v2
 with and without extended session security.
This library is a dependency of git-lfs (ITP #792075).  Ideally this
seems like a package that the pkg-go-maintainers could maintain but I am
willing to maintain it as well if necessary.
