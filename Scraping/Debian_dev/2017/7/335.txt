Hi
Currently, cme dpkg issues warning when a package has a dependency with a 
version requirement (e.g. "foo (>=1.2)") which can be satisfied by stable or 
old-stable.
Some parameters exists that let user decide whether the "cut-off" should be 
done for stable or old-stable.
The possibility to choose between old-stable and stable has been broken for 
quite a while and nobody complained. I guess that nobody uses this feature, so 
I'm going to remove it. (it's one of those "cool" feature that nobody actually 
cares about, oh well... )
Unless someone has a better idea, I plan to implement a simpler ruler: a 
warning will be issued only for dependencies requiring a version older than 
the oldest one known by madison.
All the best
