Dear all,
While I love and loved alioth, I know for probably newish people the
interface is somewhat ugly.
>From what I did see in https://lwn.net/Articles/724986/ it seems there
were lots of pros and cons which were discussed. I was also able to
converse with Alexander Wirt and download the survey which wasn't
available anymore for public consumption.
Can somebody tell/share which forge are the developers looking forward
to replace alioth with, pagure or something else .
The choices seem to be to do lot of coding if some project/product is
taken which is not mature enough or has features that we want and in
some cases there is restrictive licensing or/and have two products,
one which has foss licensing and the other which has commercial
aspects but more features.
While there doesn't seem to be any hurry to replace alioth today, the
clock is ticking.
There is/was some discussion about it in May 2017
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/05/msg00095.html, the
thread I'm reading right now. Would be nice though if somebody can
share what is/are the possible scenarios.
