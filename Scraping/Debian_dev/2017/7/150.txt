Errr, it may not look difficult to *you*, but to someone who is learning
how to tinker Linux, things like enp0s25f1 looks really difficult and
scary.
And while I don't find it difficult either, I'm annoyed by having to
find out the name of the network board of the systems I'm using, while
basically 95% of them will ever have only one interface anyway. It looks
really odd that the default is to get annoyed 95% of the time for no
reason there... (again, because it seems this doesn't get through: I'm
*not* saying this naming scheme doesn't fix anything. I'm just saying
that 95% of the time there's only one network device anyway, so the fix
is moot 95% of the time)

The reasoning is the converse: non-techy users will just not be exposed
to interface names anyway. Debian users, however, tend to be more techy,
and do see these interface names. And basically *all* documentation
before this interface name change is now incomprehensible to techy
beginners.
I'm really worried here: this change, like a lot others done recently,
is making the Linux ecosystem yet more complex to understand, thus
raising the barrier for techy beginners yet higher.
At which point will we just stop seeing new random contributers, just
become the system has become too complex to grasp by oneself?
