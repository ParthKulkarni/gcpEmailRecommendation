  Description     : library for running command line commands in Ruby
 cocaine is used to run command line commands in Ruby. Commands are run
 using backticks(Ruby 1.8) or Process.spawn(Ruby 1.9).
 .
 This library supports interpolated arguments and prevents attempts
 to break system. This library throws exception if the command returns
 errors.
 .
 Performance can be increased by installing posix-spawn gem.
