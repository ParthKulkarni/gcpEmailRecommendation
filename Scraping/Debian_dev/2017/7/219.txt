Which means that while true, this was largely irrelevant:

As I saw it the discussion pertinent to two classes of people:
(a) Those who typed in the device names regularly.  As far as I can
    tell those people either don't see kernels interface names changing
    or don't care about it.  I gather from the responses here thereÂ 
    quite a few people fit into this category.
    I am sort of one.  I often use my laptop to configure some
    recalcitrant device.  I like most don't see the kernel assigned
    names change (because as Greg Kroah-Hartmanboth said, it's very
    rare), and I wouldn't care if they did change because the areÂ 
    managed by Network Manager.  But when I'm doing the "bash (pun
    intended) some device into submission" thing I use a USB dongle
    which I have to manually configure and I detest having to enter
    the new scheme's 16 character interface name multiple times.
(b) Those who enter the debian device names manually into config
    files, and have machines that network device names even though
    no oneÂ armed with a screw driver has been near the thing.
    These people would very much care.  I was asking whether they
    exist.  So far I've seen person say they are one.
To put it another way: there are a lot of opinions being expressed
here, but I suspect most aren't coming from people with skin in the
game.
As for *.link files,Â syntactically they like all systemd stuff are a
huge improvement on what came before them.  But the old ugly udev rules
have one thing over them - they provide hooks for scripts to cover
cases they haven't thought of.  Scripts seem to be an anathema to the
author's of systemd.  While that remains true they will never be able
to replace udev rules in all cases.signature.asc
