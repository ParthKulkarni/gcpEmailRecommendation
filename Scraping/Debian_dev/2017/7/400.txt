  Description     : Functions for loading root certificates for TLS connections.
 Go's standard library crypto/tls provides a common mechanism for
 configuring TLS connections in tls.Config. The RootCAs field on this
 struct is a pool of certificates for the client to use as a trust store
 when verifying server certificates.
 .
 This library contains utility functions for loading certificates destined
 for that field, as well as one other important thing:
 .
 When the RootCAs field is nil, the standard library attempts to
 load the host's root CA set.  This behavior is OS-specific, and
 the Darwin implementation contains a bug that prevents trusted
 certificates from the System and Login keychains from being loaded
 This library contains Darwin-specific behavior that works around
 that bug.
 I'm intend to package this inside pkg-go team, and I need sponsor to upload.
 This library is a new dependency of golang-github-hashicorp-atlas-go-dev, which
 is needed for new packer(https://bugs.debian.org/865337).
