Awesome!  This sounds like the best solution so far.
I haven't yet looked at the implementation (did not hit my mirror yet, and
I got other stuff to finish at the moment), but from your description it
sounds like this would fit most use cases.
Especially if you could somehow add "first and only wired/wifi interface in
the system", that doesn't fail in case it is used erroneously when there's
more than one interface after all.  This would fix most of SoC/VM use cases
I've seen "predictable" names fail horribly.
We'd also need something that generates the interfaces file (during d-i?)
using your syntax, but let's have your system tested and finished first.
Big fat kudos!  Add this to the pool of beers I owe you. :√æ
