Sid likely won't work here because both sid and testing may get ahead
of the version used to build stable image. And even if sources match,
packages won't because of the build environment. The backports repo
looks more suitable, but again at some point you may want to see a
backported testing version of utilities there, not patched stable.

In the compilers development a failure to build itself is normally
considered a critical compiler bug that blocks the release. Even
though bootstrapping is not the main purpose of compiler existence.
Similarly, a failure to produce an install image of debian on a system
running the same version of debian sounds like a perfectly valid
ground the delay the release.
I guess when the next release approaches someone may want to set up
nightly image builds of testing using clean testing environment and
report bugs in the building process (if any) as RC. I know the
debian-cd team already have weekly builds of testing, but I assume
they run the patched toolchain from alioth repo. I'll see if I can
arrange a self-build testing framework for x86 and amd64, but I'll
definitely won't be able to cover all archs.
