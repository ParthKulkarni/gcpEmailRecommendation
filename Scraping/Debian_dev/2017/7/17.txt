  Description     : syntax highlighting for puppet manifests in vim
The vim-puppet package provides filetype detection and syntax
highlighting for puppet manifests (files ending with ".pp").
.
As per the Debian vim policy, installed addons are not activated
automatically, but the "vim-addon-manager" tool can be used for this
purpose.
Note: the vim-puppet package was previously produced by the puppet 
source, but has been dropped from the upstream tree as it was no 
longer maintained.
