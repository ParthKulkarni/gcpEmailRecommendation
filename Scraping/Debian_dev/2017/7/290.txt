  Description     : efficient cyclic list implementation for Javascript
 cyclist creates a list of fixed size that is cyclic. In a list
 the element following the last one is the first one.
.
This is a dependency for npm, Node.js package manager.
Node.js is an event-based server-side Javascript engine.
.
 I plan to join Javascript package team. Pirate Praveen has agreed to
 sponser this package.
