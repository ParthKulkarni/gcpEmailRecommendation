The problem is, that horse's replacement has just received a yet another
black mark, this time stretch-sized.  At this time I'd say even no horse at
all is way better than "predictable" random names.  The "no horse" solution
has the benefit of working better in 95% cases, the remaining ones being
very well correlated with expected admin skills.
Another potential horse would be to take current "predictable" output and
feeding it to a state file: that would fix at a good part (but not all) of
problems we have.
