  Description     : Minimal audio player for manual speech transcription
Plays audio sources to transcribe them in your favourite text application.
Speed of playback can be changed without changing the pitch and on pause it
will rewind for a few seconds according to your preferences. Parlatype can be
controlled with the "Play" button from your keyboard even if its window is not
focused.
Parlatype fills a gap for an easy to use transcription utility (manual
transcription). I'm not aware of another program in Debian for GNOME,
targeting transcriptions and also offering a waveform. It's written for
GNOME but should work on other desktop environments as well.
Parlatype doesn't have its own editor, it recommends LibreOffice and has a
set of macros (Python scripts) for LibreOffice.
Parlatype has its own library with dev headers, docs and gobject
introspection. Although that library is intended for public use, probably
there are no other consumers except Parlatype itself.
I would maintain it myself, I'm also the upstream author.  I'm looking for
a sponsor (actually I reported the sponsorship request first).
