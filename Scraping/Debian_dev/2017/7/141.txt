I'd say the last part is the most important one: the vast majority of
machines have exactly one Ethernet interface and at most one WiFi interface. 
Furthermore, the ones that got more either have an admin with some knowledge
(bigger servers) or come preloaded (routers).
Predictability is important, thus let's actually have _predictable_
interface names.  The kernel default, eth0 and wlan0, is good enough for
most users, why not keep that?  Even just ignoring the issue completely
is much, much better than current state.
FreeDesktop's interface naming promised stability, it did not deliver.  Even
regular non-fancy x86 machines often switch names on jessie->stretch
upgrades, not to mention arm SoCs with no MAC address at all (that EPROM
would cost a few cents, you see...).
