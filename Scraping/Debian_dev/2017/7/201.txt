ip link set dev eth0 alias foo0
But don't expect everything to work right with this: it is the same
mechanism that was used for adding "extra IP addresses" when using
braindamaged crap from a decade ago (old ifconfig), so I very much bet
there are going to be stuff misbehaving...
The obvious thing would be to just tell the kernel to change namespaces
in the first place (kconfig + command line), and have userspace aware of
the kernel namespace using sysfs.  Just beware the kernel default would
be "unspecified" (and not "eth*", etc) because this is not central
policy in the kernel at all).  I have never understood why this wasn't
done, since it is absolutely trivial to implement, even if it is a lot
of busywork (you have to patch each !@#$ network driver).  But you could
clean up a _LOT_ of crap kernel side while at it, AND create both a
central point for naming this stuff AND better device grouping, so it
would be worth the trouble.  And it would be opt-in, default N, and
detectable from userspace, so that it would not regress anything not
prepared for it.
