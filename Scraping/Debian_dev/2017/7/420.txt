  Description     : Bootable USB Storage Creator for Windows Installer/PE
 This package contains two programs:
 .
  - woeusb: a simple Bash script that enables you to create your own bootable
  Windows installation USB storage device from an existing Windows Installation
  DVD or its ISO image.
  - woeusbgui: woeusb's GUI wrapper based on WxWidgets
 Supported images: Windows Vista, Seven, 8 installer
 for any language and any version (home, pro...)
 and Windows PE.
 .
 This software is a fork of Colin GILLE / congelli501's WinUSB software.

-------------------
 - why is this package useful/relevant?
   It allows debian users to create USB Windows installer easily without
resorting to a Windows machine.
 - is it a dependency for another package?
   Nope.
 - do you use it?
   Yes.  This application is often needed for re-installing collegue/family
member's Win
 - if there are other packages providing similar functionality, how does it
compare?
   It's possible to achive the same goal by meddling with `parted`, `grub` etc,
however this requires advanced knowlege to disk partitioning and OS
bootstrapping.
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
   As I am one of the upstream developers the debianization of this package
will be simultaneously maintained in the upstream codebase.  The changes
specifically required by Debian may be maintained in a separated branch or code
repository.
