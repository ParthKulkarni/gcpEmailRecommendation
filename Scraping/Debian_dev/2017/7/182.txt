Initial support for interface matching has been uploaded, so once it
hits your mirror you can apt-get upgrade to ifupdown 0.8.20 and use it.
An example to match an interface by MAC address:
    allow-hotplug mac/01:23:45:67:89:ab/=foo
    iface foo inet dchp
    iface foo inet6 auto
    auto type/1/2=bar
    iface bar inet static
        address 192.168.1.1/24
This will match any interface that has MAC address 01:23:45:67:89:ab,
and will use the "foo" stanzas to configure it. It will also match the
second Ethernet interface (whose /sys/class/net/interfaces/$IFACE/type
file contains the line "1") and bring it up using the "bar" stanza.
Details are in the interfaces(5) manpage.
You can also use pattern matching on the ifup and ifdown command line.
You cannot use pattern matching in "iface" stanzas (yet).
The reason I used the / is that this is, as far as I know, the only
character that is never allowed in interface names on Linux. On that
note, the above examples will not work on Hurd and FreeBSD, support for
pattern matching on those platforms besides just the interface name will
follow later.
