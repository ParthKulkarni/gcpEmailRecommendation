Not only old docs, unfortunately.  The change makes it impossible to
describe system independent procedures involving a network device.
As an example, I happen to get a few questions regarding LTE modem
configuration.  Most of these users will have a single modem, so I know
the kernel network interface name is 'wwan0'.  Previously I could ask a
user to do e.g. 'ifconfig wwan0'.  Now?  Depending on how "techy" the
user is, I may have to write more about netdev naming policies than the
real issue.
This isn't something I just made up.  It is a real problem for me.  And
I only see a fraction of the problem.  I can imagine the issues for
those attempting to write any docs touching Linux networking..

Yes.  And what is most worrying is all the excuses made, often claiming
the opposite.
We are all going to laugh at enp0s31f6.  But it looks like we are
looking at a couple of years of breakage first, before the advocates
move on to some other shiny project where they can solve a problem that
didn't exist before they entered the scene.
