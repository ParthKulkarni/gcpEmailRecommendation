Package: general
Severity: normal
Hey.
Not sure where this should actually go to (apt? ftp-masters? backports?)...
please reassign as it fits :-)
It's seems to have never properly worked for me, to use the suite-names for
backports repos in sources list.
E.g. having:
 deb http://foo/debian/ oldstable/updates main contrib non-free
instead of jessie/updates goes fine, but:
 deb http://foo/debian/ oldstable-backports main contrib non-free
gives a warning:
 W: Conflicting distribution: http://foo oldstable-backports InRelease (expected oldstable-backports but got jessie-backports)
in aptitude and friends.
Looking at the Release files there seem to be some possibly wrong usage of the fields?
jessie's security Release has:
 Origin: Debian
 Label: Debian-Security
 Suite: oldstable
 Codename: jessie
while that of the backports Release has:
 Origin: Debian Backports
 Label: Debian Backports
 Suite: jessie-backports
 Codename: jessie-backports
not using Suite: oldstable-backports for some reason.
Can this be fixed (for all backports suites)?
Cheers,
Chris.
