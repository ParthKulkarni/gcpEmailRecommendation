Yes, that would work. There are still some issues, like random numbering
during the first boot. Note that udev is mostly following this scheme
with "eno1", "eno2", ...

For a physical machine, the only interface is usually eno1. For a
virtual machine, the numbering may be absent and this case, the
interface name is ensX with X which depends on your provider. Maybe an
exception could have been done for virtio, but there are edge cases they
may be difficult to catch (someone changing virtio to e1000 for example).
This can be checked with:
  udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/eno1 | grep ID_NET_NAME
The default order is onboard, slot, path. Debian has a local
modification to use the MAC address for USB devices.
