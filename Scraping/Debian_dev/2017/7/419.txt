  Description     : Alibaba Cloud OSS SDK for Go
 This Go SDK is based on the official APIs of Alibaba Cloud OSS.
 .
 Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is a cloud storage service provided
 by Alibaba Cloud, featuring massive capacity, security, a low cost, and high
 reliability.
 .
 The OSS can store any type of files and therefore applies to various websites,
 development enterprises and developers.
 .
 With this SDK, you can upload, download and manage data on any app anytime and
 anywhere conveniently.
It's the new dependency for packer.
I will package this inside pkg-go team and need sponsor as well.
Regards,
Shengjing Zhu
