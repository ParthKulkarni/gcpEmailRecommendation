Subject : 2ping: Missing binary package in sid

The 2ping package is in an odd state at the moment.  For background, on
Saturday morning (UTC) I made two source-only uploads, 4.0-1 then 4.0-2,
which exposed some issues (a dependency problem and problem with the
unittest suite, respectively).  The latter was corrected upstream and I
uploaded 4.0.1-1, which was accepted and 2ping_4.0.1-1_all.deb
successfully built[0].
However, the binary package is not yet in sid[1], though the source
package is[2].  PTS[3] suggests it's in NEW, but NEW[4] has no mention
of it.  removals.txt[5] has an entry for removing the older 3.2.1-1 from
unstable ("no longer built from source, no reverse dependencies"),
presumably because the source package had been updated but not the
binary yet, and I think that may have something to do with the current
state.  But I have no idea where 2ping_4.0.1-1_all.deb ended up going.
