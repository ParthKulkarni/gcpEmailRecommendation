I wonder if anyone actually uses /dev/disk/by-path?

Independent of the current discussion: why not? Is there something that
would prevent the kernel from starting to provide network device nodes
in /dev in some future release?
It seems to me that providing a file in /dev and internally mapping this
to the old device name shouldn't be that big a thing...
Curious,
