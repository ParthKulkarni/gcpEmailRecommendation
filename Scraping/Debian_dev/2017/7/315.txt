I dont understand why this is seen as trolling. We are willing to delay our
release for (certain) serious bugs and here I dont even see how there would 
be much delay, if we had the policy of say requiring a debian-cd upload
(to sid) with the changes made to create the stable upload.
I also think this is basically happening, just not per policy but per Sledge
just doing that work.
And maybe (probably?) there is a case for the Stretch images where one tool
wasnt uploaded yet. Seems like a bug to me too (if thats the case), but not
really a reason for a flamewar nor calling out trolling.
(So also thanks to Jonas *and* Sledge from me, for keeping this thread
constructive for the most part!)
