Hello,
today I installed a Proxmox 5 system on a dedicated server. Then I want 
to create a VM using the netinst Debian 9 stretch image. After a 
successful installation without network access I want to add a network, 
but when I type route in the commend line debian say that this command 
is not found, but when I used Debian 8.8 jessie with the netinst-img 
without network access this commend worked. WHY??????????????????
On top of this when I want to add my network to the Debian 9 VM this 
failed because of the route commend is not found and with the Debian 8.8 
VM this is working. WHY??????????????????
Best wishes,
Maximilian Althaus
