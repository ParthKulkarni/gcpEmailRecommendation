This worked fine on jessie, but on stretch it doesn't anymore.
I've solved the problem by net.ifnames=0; apparently the cause is rules
numbered 73..80 overwriting those set by 70-persistent-net.rules
You also shouldn't use eth0/eth1 because the races aren't fully solved;
using descriptive names like lan0/out0 has the extra benefit of marking
which interface is used for what purpose.
