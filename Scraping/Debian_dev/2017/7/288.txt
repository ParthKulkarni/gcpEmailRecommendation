  Description     : two players puzzle game
 Sokochez is a two players puzzle game inspired by Sokoban, it contains a map
editor, there are three gamemodes and many different maps.
This package is useful for one to distract himself and does not require any
dependency as it is made in pure C++. I played this game and created it with
friends so I know it quite well.
By the way it can also be played by a single person even though the gameplay is
meant for two players.
I am planning to maintain it alone since it is a small package.
