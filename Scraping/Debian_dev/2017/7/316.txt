IMO a better arrangement would be something that
  - did not involve any manual intervention by the image preparation team
  - ensured that the actual source code was published _somewhere_
  - automatically ensured that the generated image farm contains
    enough information to always reliably find the corresponding version
Even if the place where the files end up is not the Debian archive.
To look at this another way:
I think publishing the source is the vitally important part.  That
allows anyone else to reproduce what we have done.
Publishing the source _as a package in the Debian archive_ involves
additional release management work, and other additional
complications.  If the source code actually used is published, that
extra work does not need to be done by the image preparation team.  It
can be done by *anyone* who can get a sponsor for their upload.
It is great if the image preparation team do this work too.  But I
don't want them to feel they have to.  I also don't want a situation
to arise where, because that work hasn't been done, the source is
completely unavailable.
I'm afraid I'm not offering to write the image-script-autopublication
patch.  But those who are complaining about lack of timely provision
of source code should write that patch, rather than moaning.
Those who are complaining about the packages in the archive being out
of date should step forward and volunteer to take over doing the
uploads.
Ian.
