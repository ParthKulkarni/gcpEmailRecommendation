  Description     : composable build system for OCaml projects
 Jbuilder is a build system designed for OCaml/Reason projects
 only. It focuses on providing the user with a consistent experience
 and takes care of most of the low-level details of OCaml
 compilation. All you have to do is provide a description of your
 project and Jbuilder will do the rest.

 The scheme it implements is inspired from the one used inside Jane
 Street and adapted to the open source world. It has matured over a
 long time and is used daily by hundred of developpers, which means
 that it is highly tested and productive.
