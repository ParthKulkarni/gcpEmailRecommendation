Subject : Running tests with xvfb

Hallo all,
I have a package whose tests crash X on my machine, which uses nouveau.
This makes testing rather inconvenient.
Running the tests in a chroot with xvfb works, but takes an age (i.e. a
couple of minutes) to set up the chroot. This is also not conducive to
rapid testing of small changes.
Running the test outside the chroot with xvfb still crashes X, because
xvfb seems to grab the "real" X if it is there.
Is there a way of getting xvfb to ignore the system X?
Regards
Jeff
