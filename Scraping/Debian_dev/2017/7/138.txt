Because of a race with the kernel creating eth1 while you're trying to
rename eth0->eth0_rename->eth1, right?  That's trivially solvable by
inventing a new scheme, such as e0 e1 (I'm sure someone can sound a scheme
that sounds better than this).
On the other hand, I use kernel-assigned names on all my machines that don't
have multiple interfaces, thus I don't know how stable
70-persistent-net.rules is on the MAC-less machines.  I guess you guys know
more.  But even if you take those new "persistent" names as a base for the
state file, we wouldn't gain stability over kernel upgrades but the names
would be actually predictable for the user (ie, the admin would know the
only interface will be "e0").
