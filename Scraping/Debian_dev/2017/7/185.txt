As Adam discovered, there was still a bug preventing this from actually
working for allow-* interfaces, but a fix has just been uploaded.

That's indeed an interesting issue. Currently, ifupdown doesn't rename
interfaces. You could add a line like:
	post-up ip link set $IFACE name $LOGICAL
Which will do what you want, except ifupdown doesn't track interface
renames this way and will get very confused. In particular, ifdown will
not work anymore. So some code should be added to ifupdown to support
interface renaming.
Note that there is a package called "ifrename" that has a nice way of
configuring interface renaming, and works independently of your init
system, udev et cetera. But I can see how it would be nice to have
renaming integrated in ifupdown.
