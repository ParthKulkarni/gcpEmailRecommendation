We (Robotics section of Debian Science team) are packaging
ROS (Robot OS: http://www.ros.org/) for Debian. ROS uses
many packages already in Debian, but also has a set of
core/toolchain/build-system packages which are not yet
uploaded. This package is part of that ROS system.
Most of the packaging work is already done, and available at
http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/ros/
