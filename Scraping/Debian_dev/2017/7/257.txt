This email would be better sent to the debian-user mailing list. The

support question.
What desktop do you want? Log in as root and use the command-line tools 
to install the desktop you want. For example, to install XFCE and a 
full-featured suite of desktop applications:
Restart your computer and you should be presented with a graphical 
login. The instructions are similar for other desktops including gnome, 
mate, cinnamon, lxde, and kde.
If you are on a laptop, you might also consider installing "task-laptop" 
for power management and wifi tools.
Kind regards,
