One (or even multiple) bad experience(s) does not invalidate the
recommendation to file bugs when you find them. Leaving aside whether
or not #685223 is representative of the corpus of such bugs as a whole,
if everyone took such a defeatist attitude towards the possibility of
bugs being fixed then no bugs would ever be filed and the quality of
Debian would be crap.
