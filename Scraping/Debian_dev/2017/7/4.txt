  Description     : C++ library providing common and portability functionality for all OME C++ components
OME Common is a standalone C++ library required by other OME C++
projects for common functionality which is not readily available from
the C++ Standard Library.  This includes basic portability functions,
to wrapping other libraries to make them usable with Modern C++
programming practices.
It serves a similar purpose to the OME formats-common Java library,
with some shared functionality, though for the most part they are
quite different.

This package is a basic dependency for ome-files, the C++ implementation
of a writer of the OME model.
I plan to maintain it as part of my day to day job.  I believe that
the debian-med packaging team to be a goof fit though as the follow
up on this package is the rest of the ome packages, starting with
ome-files, then bioformats, then omero to provide a complete suite
for management of biological microscopy data.
