as far as *installing* (not running) Debian packages under a user-writable path
without superuser privileges goes, there is $DPKG_ROOT which is an attempt at
making this process less hacky than using dpkg -x. Instead of just extracting
the packages somewhere, you *install* them into a non-root path by using the
dpkg options:
--admindir=$(DPKG_ADMINDIR) --instdir="$(DPKG_INSTDIR)" --force-script-chrootless --force-not-root
There are still a couple of remaining problems. For example maintainer scripts
still mostly assume that the package is installed in root. For that, dpkg
exports the environment variable $DPKG_ROOT which the maintainer script can use
to find out where the package is being installed to. Another non-simple blocker
is dpkg-maintscript-helper, also known as #832176. Another are maintainer
script dependencies which have to be met by the host system.
You can find out more about this topic here:
https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/Spec/InstallBootstrap
But this is only about the *installation* without root part. This is not about
also being able to run anything that was installed into a non-root path.
Thanks!
