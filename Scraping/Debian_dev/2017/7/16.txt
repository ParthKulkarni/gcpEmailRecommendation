Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I intend to orphan the gegl package.
The package description is:
 GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a graph based image processing
 framework.
 .
 GEGLs original design was made to scratch GIMPs itches for a new
 compositing and processing core. This core is being designed to have
 minimal dependencies and a simple well defined API.
 .
 This package contains a bunch of test programs.
Cheers.
