  Description     : Yet Another Scan Wizard
 YASW (Yet Another Scan Wizard) is an application used to correct images
 taken with a camera. It can be used to post process the scanning of a book
 or to correct an individual image taken with a camera.
I intend to maintain this project either under the collab-maint project, or 
through the pkg-multimedia team. I'll need a sponsor, and would welcome a 
co-maintainer although upstream releases are infrequent so I don't expact 
large amounts of work to keep the package up-to-date.
