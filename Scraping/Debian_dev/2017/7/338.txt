Hello Debian-Devel!
I have this tricky situation. It appears in 2011, upstream made a change
to Heimdal that broken the shared library ABI, and didn't change the
SONAME.

commit af011f57fc4ae6e865bab471c20aa9047e4e19d4

    Provide server side kadm5_chpass_principal_3() with ks_tuple implementation.
    
    We enable kadm5_chpass_principal_3() in the server side of the
    library.  The client kadm5 library calls will still return the
    error KAMD5_KS_TUPLE_NO_SUPP.

This change was undetected, and included in Debian in Wheezy, Jessie,
Stretch.
Now Upstream has realized their
error. https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/issues/246
There response was to restore the ABI to the previous state. This change
is now in testing and unstable.
What should I do? It appears patch the ABI back to the previous state,
and break compatability with other distributions. Or I can keep it as it
and break upgrades.
Please read the bull details of 868640 for more information, and for
details of similar situation that occured before the Stretch
release. #848694
