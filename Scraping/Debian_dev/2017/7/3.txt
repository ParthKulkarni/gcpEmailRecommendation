Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I intend to orphan the gtkpod package.
The package description is:
 gtkpod is a platform independent GUI for Apple's iPod using GTK3.
 It allows you to upload songs and playlists to your iPod. It supports ID3
 tag editing, multiple charsets for ID3 tags, detects duplicate songs,
 allows offline modification of the database with later synchronisation,
 and more.
Cheers.
