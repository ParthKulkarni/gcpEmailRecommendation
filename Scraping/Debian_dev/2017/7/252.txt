I'm sorry to hear the potential damage to your laptop. I think you need to
provide a quite a few more details though so someone can help you. For
example, the make/model of your laptop, perhaps lspci -vv, etc. etc.
You may even want to close this bug and re-file using reportbug against the
Linux kernel package. This should collect the relevant data to diagnose
your issue.
Regards,
