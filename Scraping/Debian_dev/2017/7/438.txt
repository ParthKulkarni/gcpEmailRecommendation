  Description     : QML bindings for GSettings
This package provides a QML binding for GSettings.
This package is the build-dependency of various Deepin software to be packaged
by pkg-deepin team.
Gsettings-qt was a Ubuntu-only package. I intend to put it into Debian and fix
any problem encountered.
I intend to co-maintain this package inside debian-qt-kde team and put its
packaging repository (converted to Git with the help of git-bzr) into collab-
maint to ease external contribution and co-maintenance.
Anyone interested is welcomed to co-maintain and review the status of this
library package.
