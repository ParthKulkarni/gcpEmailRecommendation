Description       : Simulation Description Format (SDF) parser
SDF is an XML file format that describes environments, objects, and
robots in a manner suitable for robotic applications. SDF is capable of
representing and describing different physic engines, lighting
properties, terrain, static or dynamic objects, and articulated robots
with various sensors, and acutators.  The format of SDF is also
described by XML, which facilitates updates and allows conversion from
previous versions. A parser is also contained within this package that
reads SDF files and returns a C++ interface.
Version 4 is already in debian.
