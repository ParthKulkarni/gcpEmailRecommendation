 - why is this package useful/relevant?
   This package is trying to make l10n-tw-logo as installed icons/clipart that
can be applied to l10n-tw related folders or documents.
   There is future plans to making desktop backgrounds derived from the icons,
but it is not implemented yet.
   This package is selected due to to it's simplicity(the only programming
language used is Bash scripts) for learning Debian packaging, there may be less
use for it to be really included in Debian, though.
 - is it a dependency for another package?
   Nope.
 - do you use it?
   Yes.
 - if there are other packages providing similar functionality, how does it
compare?
   Nope.
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
   As I AM the upstream the packaging wil be mainained in the upstream
codebase.
