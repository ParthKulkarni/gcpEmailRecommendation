  Description     : Java library for one dimensional arrays up to 2^63 elements
Current implementations of Java Virtual Machines allow the creation of
one-dimensional arrays of length smaller than 2^31 elements.
JLargeArrays addresses the problem of maximal size of one-dimensional
Java arrays providing classes that can store up to 2^63 primitive
elements.
JLargeArrays provides the abstract class for primitive types, as well
as the non abstract classes for Number classes, String, bit values,
complex numbers, and objects.  It also supports subarrays.
This package is a common dependency on scientific java software where
the 2^31 number of elements is a common issue.
