I was under the impression that Debian does not even use biosdevname.
(I'm not sure anyone else still does.)
But I can be wrong, of course.
I think now that we released this the most straightforward way to go
about this is to cope and document for others. Personally I dislike the
idea of a state file that you need to know about to remove during
imaging, but to everyone their own.
If you use things like systemd-networkd[1], you'll also notice that the
configuration scheme does not even require you to specify the interface
to operate on. Instead you get a bunch of match expressions. Which
leaves things like daemons, which more often hardcode IP addresses than
interfaces, though.
Kind regards
