It's simpler to use (for example)
# cat /etc/systemd/network/77-en0.link
[Match]
MACAddress=1c:1b:0d:9a:34:98
[Link]
Name=en0
# cat /etc/systemd/network/77-en1.link
[Match]
MACAddress=1c:1b:0d:9a:34:9a
[Link]
Name=en1
This rule works even if you use sysvinit as pid 1.
Renaming NICs within the kernel's "eth*" namespace is discouraged upstream.
Suppose that the kernel names "1c:1b:0d:9a:34:9a" "eth0" and
"1c:1b:0d:9a:34:98" "eth1". You'll have a renaming clash when udev
tries to apply your rules.
