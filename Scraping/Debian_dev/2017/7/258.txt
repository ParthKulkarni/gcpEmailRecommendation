I've got a request to remove the conffile status of a file after it is
no longer a conffile.  dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile does not
seem to do this, based on the documentation and the source code.
Is there a clean way to implement this (i.e., by not patching
/var/lib/dpkg/status directly)?  If there is a way, is there a reason
not do it?
