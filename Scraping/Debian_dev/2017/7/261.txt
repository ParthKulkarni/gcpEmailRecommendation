  Description     : colossal cave adventure, the 1995 430-point version
 This is the last descendent of the original 1976 Colossal Cave
 Adventure worked on by the original authors -- Crowther & Woods.
 It has sometimes been known as Adventure 2.5. The original PDP-10
 name 'advent' is used for the built program to avoid collision with
 the BSD Games version.
I intend to maintain the package in the pkg-games group on alioth.
Regards,
Tobias
