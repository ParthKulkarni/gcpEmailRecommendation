Actually, no. Cyril is the d-i release manager (and most active
developer), and that's what he's focussing on. The "Stretch d-i RC5"
announcements were specifically for d-i, not for Stretch as a whole.
The final *Stretch* release was under the control of the release
team, obviously with attendant discussion with the installer and
images people too.

ACK. We need more effort to do this kind of thing, and volunteers to
help drive it.
