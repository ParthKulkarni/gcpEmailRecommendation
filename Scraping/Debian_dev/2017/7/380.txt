  Description     : Go Struct and Field validation (version 8.x)
 Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual
 fields based on tags.
 .
 It has the following unique features:
   * Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or
     custom validators.
   * Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a
     multidimensional field to be validated.
   * Handles type interface by determining it's underlying type prior to
     validation.
   * Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see Valuer
   * Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations
     to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
   * Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the
     JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting
     FieldError
Please also include as much relevant information as possible.
