Then let me add myself to that list. I have a couple of firewall-routers 
at work, which have both onboard and PCI Ethernet cards. The onboard and 
PCI cards use chips from different companies, thus different drivers. So 
whether the first onboard port or the first PCI port becomes eth0 
(according to the kernel) depends on which module loads/initializes 
first. That changes each boot. (Or at least it did last time I checked).
I think the same is true for the mid-tower at home that's my home server 
& firewallâ€”I wanted more ports, so I added a card. So the kernel order 
will again depend on module load/init order.
However, the new fixed names don't matter to meâ€”I've always set custom 
names (not just on these machines, but most machines with multiple 
NICs). I rename the interfaces things like "lan", "dmz", "comcast", 
"verizon", etc. depending on what's connected to the port.
OTOH, my laptop runs Network Manager. I don't really care what the 
interfaces are called there, or if they're stable. Though it's a slight 
pain when I need to troubleshoot something and am faced with a long USB 
WiFi adapter interface name. (Actually, I set up teaming in Network 
Manager, which seems to require stable names hard-coded in the JSON 
config fieldâ€”so this isn't quite true any longer. But let's ignore this, 
as I presume it's either due to me missing something or a feature that 
isn't yet 100% done in Network Manager)
