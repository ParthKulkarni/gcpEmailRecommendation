  Description     : Output tracing information in your Go app based on environment variables
 tracerx Tracerx is a simple tracing package that logs messages
 depending on environment variables.  It is very much inspired
 by git's GIT_TRACE mechanism.
This library is a dependency of git-lfs (ITP #792075).  Ideally this
seems like a package that the pkg-go-maintainers could maintain but I am
willing to maintain it as well if necessary.
