Knowing the device name of a wifi dongle seems a pretty niche case. Most
users will just use network manager to select the appropriate SSID and
forget about it.

Have a look at systemd.link(5) which enables you to do that without
debugging udev.

Having a default behavior that's unreliable doesn't seem great
either. The change is surprising (and not expected on non-new systems),
but there is nothing difficult in identifying the right interface with
the new naming scheme. Other major distributions are using this new
scheme (notably Ubuntu which has no reason to have users smarter than
ours) and I don't see a lot of drama on their side. It seems that for
some reason, we are the only ones making a fuss about any change.
