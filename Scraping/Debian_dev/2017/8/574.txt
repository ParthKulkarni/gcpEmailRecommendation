  Description     : Emacs directory tree sidebar like NerdTree for Vim
This is package is for convenience and feature parity with other
IDEs...and with Vim :-o Is useful for anyone who is used to this
feature, and especially for anyone with a widescreen monitor.  I will
start using it as soon as I have packaged it.  One surprising thing it
supports is optional icons!
I plan to maintain it as a member of the Emacs Addons Team, and I will
need a sponsor.
Sincerely,
Nicholas
