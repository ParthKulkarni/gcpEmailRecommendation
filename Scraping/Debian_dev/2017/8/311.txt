Robert Edmonds:
The only package in the archive that I know of that has a seriously 
deficient set of root hints is djbdns; it has 11/13 of the current set 
of IPv4 root server addresses, and 0/13 IPv6 root server addresses. 
(However, I don't believe the 'djbdns' binary package ships with the 
IPv6 patch applied.)
dnscache does not use a "hints" mechanism.  It uses a list of the actual 
servers.  People patched this list *years ago*.  P. J. Pandit, publisher 
of ndjbdns for Fedora, updated xyr published copy of the list in 2013.  
I had an updated list in the very first published version of djbwares.
But that is as nothing.  I *first* patched this list almost *a decade 
and a half ago*.
Debian's list in its djbdns package is actually a private Debian one 
that is substituted by Debian in place of the one from the djbdns 
itself, named debian/dnsroots.global .  Debian needs to catch up.
