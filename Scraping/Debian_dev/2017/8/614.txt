  Description     : GNU R tests in Linear Mixed Effects Models
 Different kinds of tests for linear mixed effects models as implemented
 in 'lme4' package are provided. The tests comprise types I - III F tests
 for fixed effects, LR tests for random effects.
 The package also provides the calculation of population means for fixed factors
 with confidence intervals  and corresponding plots. Finally the backward
 elimination of non-significant effects is implemented.
Remark: This package is required to package the new version of
r-cran-afex to finally fix bug #800891.  The package will be maintained
by the Debian Science team at
    svn://anonscm.debian.org/debian-science/packages/R/r-cran-lmertest/trunk/
