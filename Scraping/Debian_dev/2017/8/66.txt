Please be more thoughtful about the consequences of such changes to policy.
This would not be "a purely informative change".
Your suggested wording has the potential to create a HUGE amount of tensions.
I could name a lot of team-maintained packages where a team member 
uploads a new upstream version every 1-2 years and noone ever bothers
to handle incoming bugs.[1]
If policy does not provide a definition of "actively maintaining",
it would be a reasonable interpretation to consider a package with
no upload or visible activity in new open bugs during the past
6 or 12 months as not actively maintained.
If policy states that such packages "should be orphaned" without 
describing a proper process, it is a valid reading that everyone can do 
this without trying to contact the team prior to orphaning the package.
And it does not even help with the problem Tobias raised:
When a maintainer retires or is declared MIA by the MIA team according 
to the MIA process, how can you *find* all teams and team-maintained 
packages where this maintainer was the only or last active team member
when there is no Uploaders: field?
This information could be moved from the Uploaders: field to
a database, but then this database has to exist and maintaining
the information there has to be mandatory when no Uploaders: field
is present.
Another option would be to keep the Uploaders: requirement,
but make it more clear that autogenerating is permitted.
The GNOME team already generates Uploaders: as the intersection
of current team members and people who did the latest 10 uploads
of a package.

[1] a few people are IMHO just bad maintainers, but in the common
    case there is simply too much work for too few people in a
    volunteer project and new team members are always welcome
