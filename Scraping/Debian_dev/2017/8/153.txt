Quite possibly :)

You surely could, but reimplementing exactly the same protections is
probably not the best use of your time.
Now, each of systemd and AppArmor can do hardening stuff that the
other doesn't support (at all or nicely), so sometimes it's good to do
a little bit of both.
What I would do these days:
1. Use the simplest of systemd's hardening features (e.g.
   Protect{Home,System}=, Private{Devices,Tmp,Network}=,
   CapabilityBoundingSet=) to their full extend.
   Not many unit files we ship do that yet. Generally these
   improvements can be implemented upstream and benefit users of
   systemd on other distros :)
2. For finer-grained mediation of filesystem access, I will use
   AppArmor that I find much nicer to implement, use and debug:
    * To limit write access, with systemd one must set
      ReadOnlyDirectories=/ and then a bunch of ReadWriteDirectories=
      directives. It works fine once you're done, but I found it hard
      to implement and debug this setup: with AppArmor I have clear
      logs about what access the service was denied, and with systemd
      I have no such thing. This probably explains why only one
      systemd unit installed on my system bothers doing so.
    * To limit read access, AFAIK with systemd one can only list
      forbidden places and everything else is allowed by default.
      No wonder InaccessiblePaths= is not used by any unit installed
      on my system.
Cheers,
