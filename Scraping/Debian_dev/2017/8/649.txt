Dear all,
Please CC me if somebody puts a reply
Another query but of more recent vintage is the idea of having yearly
elections for choosing DPL. Now while sadly Ian Murdock is not there
but am sure there are more than enough people who know and remember
why Ian Murdock felt the need to have yearly elections instead of a
2-5 year term.
Was it because of Bruce Perens as shared in
https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.foundation-documents.html
or something else ?
<quote=debian handbook> COMMUNITY Bruce Perens, a controversial leader
Bruce Perens was the second leader of the Debian project, just after
Ian Murdock. He was very controversial in his dynamic and
authoritarian methods. He nevertheless remains an important
contributor to Debian, to whom Debian is especially indebted for the
editing of the famous “Debian Free Software Guidelines” (DFSG), an
original idea of Ean Schuessler. Subsequently, Bruce would derive from
it the famous “Open Source Definition”, removing all references to
Debian from it.

His departure from the project was quite emotional, but Bruce has
remained strongly attached to Debian, since he continues to promote
this distribution in political and economic spheres. He still
sporadically appears on the e-mail lists to give his advice and
present his latest initiatives in favor of Debian. </quote>
If somebody knows, would be interested to know the details.
