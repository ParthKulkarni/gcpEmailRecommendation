There used to be a warning, but it was causing lots of confusion in
Debian: users were wondering if *any* of the AppArmor profile that
caused warning was applied at all. So in Jessie we decided to hide
these warnings.

If we're fine with relying purely on documentation to address this
problem for sysadmins writing their own profiles, then we can suggest
they use the existing apparmor_parser options about this:
  alias apparmor_parser='apparmor_parser --warn=rules-not-enforced --warn=rule-downgraded'
â€¦ and then no new code needs to be written :)
Would that be good enough in your opinion?
Thanks for all this useful input!
