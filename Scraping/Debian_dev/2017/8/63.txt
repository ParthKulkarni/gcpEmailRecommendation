taking part of the statistics.  The last phrase of the previous sentence
is important since the statistics are calculated *at request* of a team
member and there might be a good chance that one-person teams do not
really care about this statistics and so the impression I have is quite
biased by this fact.

I very much agree and I go further here.  Teams should watch out
actively for packages that would fit into the team and inviting the
maintainer of those packages actively or team-hijack orphaned packages
that are fitting.  I'm doing this for years in Debian Med and Debian
Science (to some extend in Debian GIS and DebiChem) and the effect was
in all cases positive for the package.  (In very few cases I was blamed
about team hijacks by third persons who were not involved, never by the
maintainer of the package.)
I'm deeply convinced that this kind of actively team forming is serving
our users by enabling better chances to keep packages up to date which
are either maintainer-orphaned or even team-orphaned.

In the teams I'm working in becoming a team member is as easy as adding
your name to Uploaders (non-DDs need to ask to be added to the team on
Alioth, ACLs are set for DDs).  I think this is the most inviting method
and I would vote for this if we find some agreement.

Kind regards
