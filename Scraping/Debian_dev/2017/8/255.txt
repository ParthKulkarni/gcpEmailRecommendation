It works with Android 6.0 on my tablet and with 7.1.1 on my newer phone.

Given the track record of vendors of Android-based phones on shipping
*any* updates Google provides, I'd say the chance of those fixes
actually reaching the end-user are slim to none.
(My Samsung tablet for example got *two* updates in its whole 4 year
life span: one to 5.1 and one to 6.0. Monthy security fixes: none.)
