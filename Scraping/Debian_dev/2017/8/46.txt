Dear all,
(Please appologize the brevity, I don't have the time needed to word that
properly)
Well, I still think that not having a human explicitly named as in charge of
the package is not good and will cause more damage than it will bring
benefits.
(Disclaimer: My view is biased with my actitivies in the MIA team)
Some remarks / questions I do not see adressed:
- If you have not a name on some task human nature tends toward that nonone
feels responsible at all. Like the German (fun) expansion of TEAM: Toll, Ein
Anderer Machts (Great, someone else it taking care)
- MANY team homepages are not updated or do not even exist. I think before
droping the requirement to have human uploaders this needs to be fixed by
policy and it must be RC(?) bug if the team homepage is
outdated/absent/inaccurate. The infomation about the teams *must* be in a way
that it can be easily found/parsed.
- There is currently no way to map a person to a team or to map a team to a
list of members -- if you need accurary. This is especially true for teams
that are smaller. - - When someon is going e.g MIA, we need to know which
teams are involved to trigger them.
- Not in all teams it is working tha everyone is looking at every package.
During the lipng transistion I filed many bugs on team-managed packages which
were never answered
- We have already the problem about "partially MIA" -- people holding several
pacakgages but neglecting several of them. Currently we have no real measures
of taking care of the neglected one, MIA team wise. This will be amplified
when there is no human responsible person named.
