Yes, definitely. Note that Python upstream explicitly recommends against
using /usr/bin/python for Python3:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/
This PEP was created in response to the breakage caused by Arch
switching /usr/bin/python to python3.
Even after we've removed Python2 at some point, until upstream changes
its mind about /usr/bin/python, I'd rather not ship it at all than have
this cause large amounts of breakage. Keep in mind that not only Debian
packages use Python, but also a ton of third-party scripts. And a simple
"/usr/bin/python not found"  is much clearer to users than some weird
syntax error due to the change in Python version.
