This is really important. A few packages in Ubuntu largely differ from
Debian because they have an AppArmor profile that hasn't yet been
incorporated into Debian. That's a profile that is already tested and
used by many Ubuntu users, and should work well with a Debian system.
I found your proposal thorough and reasonable. I hope it happens.
