Regressing on being able to orphan all packages of a known-MIA/retired
maintainer would be very bad.
Think of it as a 3 step process:
1. a bitrotting package indicates a potentially MIA maintainer
2. the maintainer agrees to orphaning all packages, or after several 
   failed contact attempts the MIA team declares that the maintainer is MIA
3. for every package where the maintainer is in Maintainer or Uploaders
   the MIA team either orphans the package, or informs team or 
   co-maintainers through an "Updating the <package> Uploaders list" bug.
Just by going through bugs, I compiled during the past 10 months a list 
of currently 250 (sic) names of people listed in Maintainer or Uploaders
of packages in unstable where I suspect the person might be MIA.
Automating this part would not be a problem, the intersection of
"in Maintainer or Uploaders of a package in unstable" and
"no email to a Debian list or the BTS in the past 12 months"
should give approximately a superset of my list.
Step 2 is actually a lot of work.
The part where removing the Uploaders: requirement could cause 
regressions is step 3.
Give for a person a complete list of all packages where this person was 
active" - if we regress on this, it means that packages will continue to
bitrot in cases where they can currently be orphaned.

You are assuming that the team notices without the current notifications 
from the MIA team that a team member is no longer active in Debian.
You are assuming that the team has a non-zero number of active members 
left after a member becomes MIA.
