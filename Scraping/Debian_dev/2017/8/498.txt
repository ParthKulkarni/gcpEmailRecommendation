  Programming Lang: C
  Description     : kinematical backreaction and average scale factor evolution
This is a library (shared + static) and a front-end example program
used for relativistic cosmology. The front-end `inhomog' provides
command-line numerical exploration of a key question in present-day
observational cosmology (is dark energy just an artefact of not
modelling structure formation properly?) and the library is aimed for
use by more computationally intensive simulations studying the same
family of questions. The description of the binary is here:
 This package contains an example front end program that uses the
 biscale_partition routines of the inhomog library, illustrating
 effective scale factor evolution in a universe with a T^3 spatial
 section that is divided into two complementary domains. The inhomog
 library provides Raychaudhuri integration of cosmological
 domain-wise average scale factor evolution using an analytical formula for
 kinematical backreaction Q_D evolution. The library routine
 lib/Omega_D_precalc.c is callable by RAMSES using ramses-scalav.
 .
 You may use this front-end program for command-line investigation
 of the role of virialisation as a potential replacement for dark
 energy (see Roukema 2017, arXiv:1706.06179).
Team: Debian Astro
The aim is for this source package and the associated binary and
library packages created from it to be maintained by the Debian Astro
team.
Sponsor:
I will need a sponsor, since I'm not a debian developer.  I'm
presently maintaining mpgrafic as part of the Debian Astro team.
This is my first try at debian packaging a library. I was happy
to find that this time around :), I found the libtool documentation
quite straightforward for creating both a shared and static library.
Cheers
