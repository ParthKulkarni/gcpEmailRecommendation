  Description     : XML/HTML Generation DSL
 Wither is a library designed to make XML generation under python as
 simple and as nicely formatted as Python code.
 .
 Wither is implemented as a thin stateless wrapper around etree.Element
 objects and works by making use of the ‘with’ keyword in Python to build
 a nested tree of etree objects that can be processed with standard
 tools/techniques
 .
 by using Python as a DSL you can automatically ensure that all tags are
 properly closed and also execute arbitrary python code to build things
 such as lists or to embed widgets
 .
 This package is needed for getting web-greeter (aka lightdm-webkit2-greeter)
 into Debian and will be maintained under the python-modules umbrella with co-
 maintenace from the pkg-mate team's side.
