  Description     : Forward freedesktop.org Idle Inhibition Service calls to Xss.
xssproxy implements the org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver D-Bus
interface described in the Idle Inhibition Service Draft by
the freedesktop.org developers. The inhibition of the
screensaver is then controlled using the XScreenSaverSuspend
function from the Xss (X11 Screen Saver extension) library.
This package is useful when using a lightweight window manager
with the X built-in screensaver. For example Firefox uses the
org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver D-Bus interface to disable the
screensaver when playing videos. This package implements this
interface and disables the X built-in screensaver in that case.
I use this program personally with xmonad, xautolock and slock.
All the major full-featured desktop environments like GNOME
come with a built-in implementation of the interface. I am new
to debian packaging and I will be looking for a sponsor when
I gathered some experience with the packaging process.
