Well, as I've already said, I don't agree with this approach for finding
MIA teams.  I'm not sure if you disagree for reasons you're not saying, or
if you just didn't see that message, or if I missed another message from
you explaining why you disagree.
Anyway, I truly don't understand why you can't determine MIA teams based
on whether their packages are maintained.  Team-maintained packages not
being uploaded translates into the team being MIA (regardless of the MIA
status of individual members).  I think it's in a lot of respects much
more straightforward than MIA maintainers, since you don't have to worry
about voting and other maintainer privileges and access.  And with most
teams there will be fewer edge cases where there are legitimate reasons
for all of their packages to have just not needed an upload, since teams
are less likely to only have a single leaf package.
