Debian Openoffice and Openstack devel.  Both are obviously non-MIA but
the run-over-by-bus-factor is something I'd be concerned about.
However, team statistics are showing another non-obvious way for packages
that might be orphaned inside a team.  If you look for instance at the
graphs with the maintainer per package relation of language teams:
    http://blends.debian.net/liststats/language-teams.html
You see some "hyperbolic shaped" graphs which means that packages inside
a team are only touched by single maintainers inside the team.  The
better shape would be a typical poison distribution shape of the graph
(pkg-perl is an excellent example) where for most of the package several
maintainers did commit.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
