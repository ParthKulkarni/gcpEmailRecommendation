Your definition is completely detached from the reality in Debian.
Many (likely the majority) of teams in Debian have not more
than 1 active member.

When all members of a team are confirmed to be MIA/retired,
this should result in an orphaning of all packages maintained
by the team.

This would create both longer bitrot for packages and more work for
an already overworked team.
