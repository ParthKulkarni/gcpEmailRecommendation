  Description     : JavaScript to load CSS asynchronously
 This JavaScript library provides functions to load CSS asynchronously.
 .
 Referencing CSS stylesheets with link[rel=stylesheet] or @import causes
 browsers to delay page rendering while a stylesheet loads. When loading
 stylesheets that are not critical to the initial rendering of a page, this
 blocking behavior is undesirable. The new <link rel="preload"> standard
 enables loading stylesheets asynchronously, without blocking rendering, and
 loadCSS provides a JavaScript polyfill for that feature to allow it to work
 across browsers, as well as providing its own JavaScript method for loading
 stylesheets.
This JS library is being packaged as a build dependency of gitea (a gogs fork).
There are a lot of build dependencies and I would love some help. If anyone is
interested in handling this package, please feel free to contact me!
