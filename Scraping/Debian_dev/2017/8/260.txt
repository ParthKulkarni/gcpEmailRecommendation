You'd think that you could also find issues such as the one you
referenced by doing test rebuilds and reporting bugs off that. In fact
that particular bug did not need the ongoing breakage to be found - it
was found years ago.
At the same time holding testing hostage does not feel right to me. I
applaud the intention, but I strongly dislike the implementation.
Kind regards
