yep having a way to detect/ask individual deamons is the way to go.
I was merely commenting on that the current kernel flag not being
reflective of actual mediation. Which the dbus daemon is providing, and
it (they) should be what is setting the support status, whether in
kernel or by a different means.
Regardless we will be keeping the kernel flag for several years to
provide backwards compat for newer kernels on earlier releases.
