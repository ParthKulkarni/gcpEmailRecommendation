Based on the PCI document they are linking to[1], the claim that the
PCI council said that TLS 1.1 also has to go by june 2018 is not true:
  The best response is to disable SSL entirely and migrate to a more 
  modern encryption protocol, which at the time of publication is a
  minimum of TLS v1.1, although entities are strongly encouraged to 
  consider TLS v1.2.
