Following up on my previous mail to debian-devel-announce....
An initial set of bug reports has now been filed while looking
for sfdisk users using codesearch.debian.net as promised.
See:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=util-linux@packages.debian.org;tag=fdisk-dependency;dist=unstable
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=util-linux@packages.debian.org;tag=fdisk-build-dependency;dist=unstable
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=util-linux@packages.debian.org;tag=fdisk-recommends-suggests;dist=unstable
Additional searches needed for fdisk and cfdisk, so further bug reports
will likely be filed later (under same usertags). Help welcome in
identifying users and filing bug reports. Please CC me so I'm aware
of your helping efforts.
Regards,
Andreas Henriksson
