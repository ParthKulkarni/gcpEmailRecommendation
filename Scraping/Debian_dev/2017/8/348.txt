Wrong.
My position is that it should acceptable for a program in main to require
a non-free service, or data, or whatever, as long as that program itself
is free and running it doesn't compromise the freedom of the user.
contrib should be for wrappers, downloaders etc. The policy uses the word
"supplemental".

and examine it.
