It's probably important to note somewhere in here that no one is proposing
that a team be prohibited from using this field that way if they want to.
All that's being proposed is that it no longer be mandatory to put some
human in the Uploaders field.
If you *want* to do this, you of course still can.  And of course teams
can set their own policies about this being mandatory for packages
maintained by that team.
