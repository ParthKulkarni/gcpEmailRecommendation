Enabling it by default doesn't mean it can't be switched off, right?  I think
it makes a lot of sense to enable something like this by default, and in fact I
can't think of a situation where you would not want it, but indeed users should
be able to set their system up without it if they so wish.

Yes, we should certainly avoid that; if it looks like that is happening, we
should abort the operation.  But from the well written plan, it sounds to me
like this is unlikely to be the case.
So just to be clear: Yes, please enable AppArmor by default.
Thanks,
Bas
