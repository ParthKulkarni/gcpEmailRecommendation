The news item doesn't specify what to do after scanning, but the referenced 
bug requests removal of the offending material.  I can certainly support the 
goal of avoiding mirrors being flagged as malware distrubutors, so removal 
makes sense from this point of view.   
The news bit refers to "test corpus", so removal would presumably not change 
the output.  But I have to wonder: are there not cases where the malware is 
present for *training* a detection system?  If so, I would imagine removal 
could reduce the effectiveness of training.  So what alternative exists for 
this case (if it indeed is a case we need to worry about)?
Thanks,
