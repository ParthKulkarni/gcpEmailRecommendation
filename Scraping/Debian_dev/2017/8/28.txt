These "Updating the <package> Uploaders list" bugs.
When the MIA team has determined that a person is MIA,[1]
it can send bugs informing all packages where that person
is listed in Uploaders that the person is no longer active.
For small teams (e.g. 2 people in a team maintaining 1 package)
this is also a way for seeing when 0 team members are left who
are still active in Debian.

    determined that a person is no longer active in Debian
