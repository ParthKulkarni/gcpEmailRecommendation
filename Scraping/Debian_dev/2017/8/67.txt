You're right.  After sending my patch I realised that it contains the
word "should", which is a magic word in policy, imposing a normative
requirement.  This was not intended.
My intended meaning: it is already best practice that *other team
members* should orphan a package if they know that no-one in the team is
actively taking care of it *according to their judgement of 'actively'*.
Would you agree that this is already established best practice?

I'll reply to this when replying to Tobias' remarks.
