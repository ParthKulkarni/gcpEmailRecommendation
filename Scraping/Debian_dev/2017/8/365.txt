Description: JSON-RPC library for GLib
 JSONRPC-GLib is a library for communicating as both a JSON-RPC client and
 server. Additionally, it supports upgrating connections to use GVariant for
 less runtime overhead.
Other Info
--------------
jsonrpc-glib was split off from gnome-builder and therefore we need it to
build gnome-builder 3.25.3+. Two other libraries were similarly split
and are being packaged now: libdazzle (Bug 867852) and template-glib
(Bug 871684).
The split was briefly mentioned at
https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2017/06/09/this-week-in-builder/
API docs are temporarily (?) hosted at
https://people.gnome.org/~chergert/docs/jsonrpc-glib/
These libraries will be maintained by the pkg-gnome team. Packaging is at
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-gnome/jsonrpc-glib.git
Thanks,
Jeremy Bicha
