while I'm glad for the other changes too, I must say I'm still+again *excited*
to see this change to debian-policy really happening now. We've come a long
way! (And still have a long way to go.)
I've wrote some more bits about this at
http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20170812-reproducible-policy/
so all I want to say now is
                                                               
   m    #                    #                                 
 mm#mm  # mm    mmm   m mm   #   m         m   m   mmm   m   m 
   #    #"  #  "   #  #"  #  # m"          "m m"  #" "#  #   #

                                            m"                 
                                           ""     
to everyone who contributed. You know who you are and you rock!
