Greetings,
I believe this is the reason I am currently unable to backup my
gmail account with isync/ mbsync
Not only valuable for me as a backup, this makes mail available for
use with notmuch with both emacs and mutt.
Of course if this persuades gmail to update soon, great.
Anyhow, assuming this to be the reason for my inability to download
mail today, what an effort to reply to these emails I am now stuck in
the bloody browser again, no vim, no emacs ...
Ralph
