The main benefit of a stable release of a distribution is getting a set 
of packages that are confirmed to work, and tested to work together.[1]
Backports are a workaround for the situation when a user of stable has
an urgent need to cherry-pick a specific package from the next stable,
but every package installed from backports brings the risk of breaking
something unrelated.[2]
If a large part of the users in an area want/need the latest upstream 
code, then a cross-distribution community-effort would actually be:
- less work (only done once for all distributions), and
- remove the risk that packages installed from backports/PPA/... have
  a negative effect on the whole system.
Unless all users would consider using the versions in stable pointless,
Debian could continue to ship the software in stable.
But comparing backports with a flatpak solution for users who want the 
latest upstream code, I see all the benefits at the flatpak solution.
When it is both less work for Debian and a better result for users,
I do not see the point why Debian should compete with that effort.

[1] some problems always slip into a stable
[2] e.g. by also pulling in an update of some library or python module
    that might have functionality changes or new bugs
