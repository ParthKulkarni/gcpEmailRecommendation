Encrypt it with a well-known symmetric password and decrypt it at
build-time? Or use libgfshare to split it into two parts (which should
be statistically indistinguishable from random) and recombine them at
build-time?
All that's necessary is to obfuscate the offending content to an extent
where automated detection won't notice, and there are lots of ways to
do that.
