  Description     : Go minifiers for web formats
 Minify is a minifier package written in Go (http://golang.org/). It
 provides HTML5, CSS3, JS, JSON, SVG and XML minifiers and an interface to
 implement any other minifier. Minification is the process of removing
 bytes from a file (such as whitespace) without changing its output
 and therefore shrinking its size and speeding up transmission over
 the internet and possibly parsing. The implemented minifiers are high
 performance and streaming, which implies O(n).
 .
 The core functionality associates mimetypes with minification functions,
 allowing embedded resources (like CSS or JS within HTML files) to be
 minified as well. Users can add new implementations that are triggered
 based on a mimetype (or pattern), or redirect to an external command
 (like ClosureCompiler, UglifyCSS, ...)
Reason for packaging:
 github.com/tdewolff/minify is likely needed by Hugo in the near future.
 .
 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3761
 and https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3760
 .
 /usr/bin/minify is also an interesting and useful tool in its own right.
