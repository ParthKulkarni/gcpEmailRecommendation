Thanks for such a comprehensive and compelling write-up :)

  $ sudo aa-status | head -n2
  apparmor module is loaded.
  49 profiles are loaded.
(Well, I should take more risks, rightâ€¦?)

Related to this, most of my packages are 'server'-ish and it feels
like some of the hardening features are also/already covered by my

Best wishes,
