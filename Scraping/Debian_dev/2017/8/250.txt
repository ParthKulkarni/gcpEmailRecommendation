I think that I live in a real enough world (commercial web hosting), and 
my customers have been asking for a while to disable at least TLS 1.0 
(thank you, Paypal!).
This is also the default for our newer servers and nobody has ever 
complained.
Can you describe some examples of what still requires 1.0/1.1 on 
a client or a server?
