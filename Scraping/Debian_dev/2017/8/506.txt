  Description     : Bioinformatics Application for Navigating De novo Assembly Graphs Easily
Bandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly graphs made by de novo
assemblers such as Velvet, SPAdes, MEGAHIT and others.
De novo assembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs but also the connections between
those contigs, which were previously not easily accessible. Bandage visualises assembly graphs,
with connections, using graph layout algorithms. Nodes in the drawn graph, which represent
contigs, can be automatically labelled with their ID, length or depth. Users can interact with
the graph by moving, labelling and colouring nodes. Sequence information can also be extracted
directly from the graph viewer. By displaying connections between contigs, Bandage opens up new
possibilities for analysing and improving de novo assemblies that are not possible by looking at
contigs alone.
More information and download links are on the Bandage website: rrwick.github.io/Bandage
The package is relevant to the field of genome assembly and will be maintained by the Debian Med
team.
