Hello Garrett,
Using a reproducible automated build, with a libre toolchain, for the
Ubuntu Font Family is the ultimate goal yes.  This needed/still needs:
  1. development of libre tool chains (== work usable by all fonts...)
  2. building the UFF fonts purely from source, using that toolchain
  3. pragmatically proving non-regression with existing binary-only 
     hand-built versions out there (as a precondition to switch-over)
For (1), there as been lots of work of libre toolchains in the last 18
months, via Dalton Maag and latterly a large push backed by the Google
Fonts team to make generic libre font toolchains, that are freely
usable by all.
For (2), there is an early test version **not ready for release** of a
open toolchain buildable 'Ubuntu' at:
  https://github.com/daltonmaag/ubuntu
Using a new-two feedback mechanism this branch was used to test and
create further required toolchain features---ultimately for the
benefit of all free/libre fonts.
(Please resist distributing builds from this until it is known to be
at the point of provable non-regression);
For (3): Proof of non-regression.  The Ubuntu Font Family is widely
used all over the place (including huge numbers of websites and from
within Google Docs).  This means there is an additional responsibility
to prove *non-regression* between the "new" automated-build-form-
source-development branch, against the prior binaries built by hand.
This type of testing requires tooling---Google Fonts has been working
on automated regression testing, which should help with this.

Yes it is taking a long time, but the world of libre fonts progressed
a lot in the last five years.  Once all of this pieces come together,
our collective dream can be fulfilled too.
Until this it is a work in progress,
