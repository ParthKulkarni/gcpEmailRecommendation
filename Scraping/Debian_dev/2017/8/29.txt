Ok, that's a good example:
So, when we (pkg-perl) get such a list of bug reports (or, which is
less work, a single mail from the MIA team about XY being inactive)
what happens is that
- we probably know that already (but it's still good to have the
  offical confirmation)
- we remove them from Uploaders in git
- nothing else changes: the package will be uploaded when there's any
  reason for it (new release, bugfix) as before when XY was still
  mentioned in Uploaders
Dropping the Uploaders field would mean that we save the work (which
can be quite tedious when we have to add the right bug numbers to the
right packages' changelog entry) without any other changes to the
maintenance of the package.
Cheers,
gregor
