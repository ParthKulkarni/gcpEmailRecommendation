Package: wnpp
Severity: wishlist
X-Debbugs-CC: debian-devel@lists.debian.org
Owner: jbicha@ubuntu.com
Package Name: template-glib
Version: 3.25.3
Upstream Author : Christian Hergert
License : LGPL-2.1+ (a few files are GPL-3+, I'm asking upstream if
that was intended)
Programming Lang: C
Description: templating library for GLib
 Template-GLib includes a simple template format along with integration into
 GObject Introspection for properties and methods. It separates the parsing of
 templates and the expansion of templates for faster expansion. You can also
 define scope, custom functions, and more with the embedded expression
 language.
Other Info
--------------
template-glib was split off from gnome-builder and therefore we need it to
build gnome-builder 3.25.3+. Two other libraries were similarly split
and are being packaged now: libdazzle (Bug 867852) and jsonrpc-glib.
The split was briefly mentioned at
https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2017/06/09/this-week-in-builder/
API docs are temporarily (?) hosted at
https://people.gnome.org/~chergert/docs/template-glib/
These libraries will be maintained by the pkg-gnome team. Packaging is at
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-gnome/template-glib.git
Thanks,
