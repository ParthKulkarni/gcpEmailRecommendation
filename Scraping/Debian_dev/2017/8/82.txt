  Description     : Go buffer and wrapper types
 This package contains several buffer types used in
 https://github.com/tdewolff/parse for example.
Reason for packaging:
 Required by github.com/tdewolff/minify,
 which in turn is likely needed by Hugo in the near future.
 .
 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3761
 and https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3760
 .
 /usr/bin/minify is also an interesting and useful tool in its own right.
