  Description     : Flatpak application building helper
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 See the flatpak package for a more comprehensive description.
 .
 flatpak-builder is a tool that makes it easy to build applications and their
 dependencies by automating the configure && make && make install steps.
flatpak 0.9.8 includes flatpak-builder in the same source package
(although we package it as a separate binary package in Debian). It has
been separated out upstream since 0.9.8, and will have a parallel
release schedule in future.
