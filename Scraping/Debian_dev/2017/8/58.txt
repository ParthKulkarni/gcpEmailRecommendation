I agree, but that's not directly relevant here, since we're talking about
team-maintained packages.  The whole *point* of team maintenance is that
there's no reason to orphan a package just because one team member went
away.  If that weren't the case, the package is, *by definition*, not
team-maintained (or the team itself is MIA, which is a different issue as
discussed below).

I'm really not.  I'm pointing out that for a lot of teams, that literally
*does not matter at all*.  Absolutely nothing changes about the
maintenance status of many team-maintained packages if the person who last
worked on that package disappears.
Teams often don't notice that someone is MIA because *it doesn't matter*
for their workflow; they're happy to have people come and go.

No, I'm not -- as I pointed out in a separate message, this is a problem
worth solving, but this is an MIA team problem that I think is best
tackled from that angle.  If all of a team's packages are bitrotting, then
the team's packages should be orphaned just like we do with an MIA single
maintainer.
