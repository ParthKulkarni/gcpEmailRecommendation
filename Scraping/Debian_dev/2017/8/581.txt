Package: general
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
        When I shut down my computer it reboots every time, but only when I use
Linux (debian). However, I don't have this problem with Windows. I have both of
the OSs on the same computer.
        And only when debian reboots after I tried to suspend it, and error
message appears before. It says something like :
"* time is in the future ( by less than a day probably due to *'s clock...)"
This message doesn't appear after using Windows or turning off the computer by
removing the battery.
Thank you,
