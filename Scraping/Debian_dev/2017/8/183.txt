  Description     : interactively insert items from kill-ring
Ever feel that 'C-y M-y M-y M-y ...' is not a great way of trying to
find that piece of text you know you killed a while back? Then
browse-kill-ring.el is for you.
Note that the command keeps track of the last window displayed to handle
insertion of chosen text; this might have unexpected consequences if you
do 'M-x browse-kill-ring', then switch your window configuration, and
try to use the same *Kill Ring* buffer again.
