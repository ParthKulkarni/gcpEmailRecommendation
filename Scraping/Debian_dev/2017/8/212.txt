  Description     : autologin greeter for lightdm
 Minimal autologin greeter for lightdm that has the same autologin
 behaviour as nodm, but being based on lightdm it stays on top of modern
 display manager requirements.
 .
 The difference between lightdm's built-in autologin and this greeter,
 are the behaviour in case of 0-seconds autologin delay: when lightdm
 autologs in with no delay, upon logout it will show the login window
 again. The intent is that if the default user logged out, they probably
 intend to log in again as a different user.
 .
 When managing a kiosk-like setups, if the X session quits then the
 desired behaviour is to just start it again.
 .
 Lightdm with an autologin timeout of 1 or more seconds would work as I
 need it, but one sees the login dialog window appear and disappear on
 screen at each system startup. While it is functional, on a kiosk setup
 it looks estetically unprofessional to my taste.
 .
 With this greeter, the X session starts right away, and is restarted if
 it quits, without any flicker of a login dialog box.
 .
 If one is not setting up a kiosk-like setup, it's very likely that the
 default autologin behaviour of lightdm is the way to go, and that this
 greeter is not needed.
 .
