Hi Robert, LaMont,
I'm familiar with the original conversation, so I had a look and found
that the server had been installed in 2003, and that /etc/bind/db.root
is a conffile, so perhaps there's historically a packaging problem where
it's not being updated automatically. The server is running jessie 8.9
with bind9 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u13.
Thanks,
