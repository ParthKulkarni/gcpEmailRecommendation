I just found out that because of that change my older Android 5.1 based
smartphone can no longer connect to my WPA-Enterprise WLAN.
Looking at https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
there is still a marketshare of ~25% of smartphones based on Android 5.0
and 5.1 and 16% based on 4.4. So this change would (at the moment) block
~40% of Android smartphones from connecting to any WLAN using PEAP or
TTLS.
And when I look at other wireless-enabled things, the ratio for support
for TLS1.2-only might be even worse and less quick to change.
Gr√º√üe,
Sven.
