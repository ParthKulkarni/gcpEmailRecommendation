Oh, okay, I see that, but I'm not sure why.  What is the purpose of
listing those email addresses that you want to preserve?

It still is a team even when it's one individual.  I don't know why you
would say that it's not.  A team can certainly contain just one person.
I'm confused about how this is at all related to listing individual email
addresses, and I don't understand why you think this would result in a
package being orphaned.
