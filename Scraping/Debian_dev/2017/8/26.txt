I think we'd need to allow Maintainer to contain multiple people if we did
that, since there are packages that are really maintained by two or three
specific people who do not have a separate team contact address.
(I agree it's rare and usually there's a single maintainer who is whoever
was last added to Uploaders and everyone else is inactive.  But real
maintenance by a couple of people who haven't created a team mailing list
does happen!)
Or, I suppose, provide some super-easy way to create small mailing lists.
