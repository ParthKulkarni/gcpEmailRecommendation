My problem is that the cause you're fighting, while laudable, should not
be fought in Debian.
Debian is a general-purpose operating system, not a security-focused
one. If we were, people would be right to expect that there might
sometimes be problems with the software they're using in support of the
"security" goal. Since we're not, people would rightly be upset if the
complex environments they're trying to support are suddenly broken in
the name of "security".

So ship a version of OpenSSL that ships with TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 (aka
TLS1.old) disabled, but *allow people to re-enable it* if things break
(without requiring them to compile their own version). By shipping a
version of OpenSSL that has TLS1.old not even compiled in, you're not
doing that.
I have seen suggestions that the goal of this would be to re-enable
TLS1.old before buster releases. If that is true, I fail to see the
point; I think it makes *much* more sense to ship buster with TLS1.old
disabled by default, but to allow for re-enabling it on a
per-application basis. Having a policy configuration that can be
modified by the system administrator through a mechanism inside libssl
that cannot be disabled and that can be configured on a per-application
basis would seem to be a much more interesting way to do this.

That latter part is certainly a good idea; and while "get the other side
to upgrade" is often a reasonable course of action, just as often it is
not, and then you need to have a way out. By not even compiling in the
code to support TLS1.old, you're depriving people of that "way out".
