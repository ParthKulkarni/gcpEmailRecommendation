I agree it's not something that should end up in a stable release
(and it's even unfortunate it propagated to testing already), but
it makes a lot of sense to disable it in unstable for a few months
to iron out the deficiencies in the applications we ship in
Debian (such as #802658).
Once that is completed, we can blame old Android releases.
