  Description     : OpenVPN script authentication module
Runs an external script to decide whether to authenticate a user or not.
Useful for checking 2FA on VPN auth attempts as it doesn't block the
main openvpn process, unlike passing the script to the
auth-user-pass-verify flag.
This plugin provides a significant improvement over the native OpenVPN
script auth functionality. I would love to see it included in Debian,
and would be happy to maintain it myself or as part of a team.
