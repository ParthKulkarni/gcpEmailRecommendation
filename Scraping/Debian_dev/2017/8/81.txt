  Description     : Go test helper functions
 Test is a helper package written in Go.  It implements a few functions
 that are useful for io testing, such as readers and writers that fail
 after N consecutive reads/writes.
Reason for packaging:
 Required by github.com/tdewolff/minify,
 which in turn is likely needed by Hugo in the near future.
 .
 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3761
 and https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3760
 .
 /usr/bin/minify is also an interesting and useful tool in its own right.
