I'm getting tired of this.  You keep avoiding my questions and changing the
subject.  Unless you start answering my questions, I'm going to stop
responding.

Don't change the subject.  You say that non-free is essential for our users to
be safe, but you find it acceptable that it is not enabled by default.  How is
that not hurting our users?

Your position is that it is acceptable for a program in main to require a
non-free service, as long as that non-free service doesn't run on the same
computer.  Why is that suddenly no longer true when the non-free service is
hosted on our own servers?  Or do you perhaps agree with me that a program
requiring a non-free service cannot be in main?

It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for our users.  It would be better if the
essential parts would be in a separate repository so I could enable only those,
but as long as that isn't implemented, of course I think the safety of our
users is more important than the looks of my package list.
Finally, for the third time, please explain your position on my hypothetical
unrar-nonfree scenario.
Thanks,
Bas
