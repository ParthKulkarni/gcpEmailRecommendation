Keycloack might be a good solution. I suggest you also test
FusionDirectory which I often use with LemonLDAP::NG to provide a full
identity management solution : https://www.fusiondirectory.org/
I made a presentation about some free softwares products that can be
used together for identity management :
https://www.slideshare.net/coudot/rmll2017-des-logiciels-libres-pour-la-gestion-des-identits.
Sadly it's in french but you have all product names, screenshots and
links to websites.
For information there will be a lot of presentation on this topic at
the next LDAPCon (https://ldapcon.org/2017/). Maybe some people from
Debian community can join us at this event.
