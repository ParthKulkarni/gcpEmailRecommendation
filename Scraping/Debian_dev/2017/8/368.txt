  Description     : Shim wrapping multiple Clojure runtimes into the same JVM
A Clojure runtime shim, allowing for multiple Clojure runtimes in the same JVM.
Clojure has a static runtime (implemented as static methods off of
clojure.lang.RT), so to run multiple runtimes in the same JVM, they
have to be loaded in isolated ClassLoader trees. ShimDandy provides a
mechanism for isolating the runtimes within a non-Clojure application,
and for calling in to the runtimes from the app.
This library is a dependency for the Clojure build tool 'boot'
and will be maintained by the Debian Java Team.
