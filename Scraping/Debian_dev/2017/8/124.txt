In practice probably only if our test hosts change from being lxc
containers to being full virtual machines, which would be good for
other aspects of test coverage too (flatpak/bubblewrap currently skip
many of their autopkgtests, and so does debootstrap).
AppArmor has some amount of support for being used inside a privileged
lxc container, but it's very new and I'm not sure it's going to be a
particularly accurate representation of what would happen on real
hardware. (One of my colleagues looked at lxc + apparmor recently and
was able to make it work, but not trivially.)
