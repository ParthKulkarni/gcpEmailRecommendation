  Description     : JS library for building interactive web applications
 This Javascript library implements functions for building interactive web
 interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible
 API.
 .
 Core features:
 - Declarative rendering with a plain JS object based reactivity system
 - Component-oriented development style with tooling support
 - Lean and extensible core
 - Flexible transition effect system
 - Fast without the need for complex optimization
This JS library is being packaged as a build dependency of gitea (a gogs fork).
There are a lot of build dependencies and I would love some help. If anyone is
interested in handling this package, please feel free to contact me!
