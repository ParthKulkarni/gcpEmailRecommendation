Sure. If I read "man 5 config" correctly though, openssl should allow
per-application configuration file snippets to be read. A proper howto
page on the wiki or elsewhere could then explain users how they should
add such a snippet for their applications (and *only* for those
applications where it is required).
I'm afraid that if you leave this to application developers, some
applications will not do it, leading uninformed users to simply
recompile OpenSSL themselves (with TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 enabled), thereby
resulting in a system with reduced security for *all* applications,
rather than just the one where they need TLS1.0.

That might be a good feature request then, I suppose.
Alternatively, you could make the default in the absense of any
configuration file be to *not* enable TLS1.2, but allow it to be enabled
by an openssl configuration change (which AIUI is not the current state
of affairs). That would work too.
