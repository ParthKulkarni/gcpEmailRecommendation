My way to do this is to check for old debhelper compat levels or old
Standard-Versions and upgrade those packages once per release cycle.  I
know how this is done in other teams but in Debian Med it works.  I'm
also using an UDD query sorting packages according to their last
uploads.  I'm regularly checking packages that are on top of the list (=
packages not uploaded for a long time) and check those for moved
upstream locations and so on.  I'm afraid that most teams do not have
a person doing this kind of QA means but if there is a dedicated team
there are ways to find those packages.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
