I could change the default settings to set the minimum supported
version as TLS 1.2. That is, act like
SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version() was called with TLS1_2_VERSION.
That would allow applications to override this this by calling
SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(). But then those are new
functions in 1.1.0 and they probably aren't supported by many
applications.
An other alternative is to use the deprecated SSL_CTX_set_options
options (SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 | SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1) by default, but then
there is probably no software that has support for clearing those
with SSL_CTX_clear_options()
