I guess the problem is that we do not even have a definition what might
be a team member.  Moreover membership is a function of time and thus
requires constant maintenance.  Nobody really wants to maintain this
actively and I have the impression that this fact is quite related that
this discussion is not really fruitful.
Kind regards
