  Description     : FIX_ME write the Debian package description
 FIX_ME: This ITP report is not ready for submission, until you are
 confident this package description is ready for Debian.
 .
 Write the short and long descriptions for the Debian package as
 explained in the Developer's Reference, §6.2.1 – §6.2.3.
 .
 You can start with the short upstream package description,
 “Distribute processing tasks to child processes with an über-simple
API and baked-in durability & custom concurrency options.”.
 .
 Be aware that most upstream package descriptions are not written to
 conform with Debian package guidelines. You need to explain the role
 of this package for a Debian audience.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
FIX_ME: Explain why this package is suitable for adding to Debian. Is
it a dependency of some other package? What benefit does it provide
compared to other similar packages already in Debian?
FIX_ME: Explain how you intend to consistently maintain this package
in Debian. If you are not yet a Debian member, does this package need
a sponsor? Do you have co-maintainers? Are you a member of the Debian
JavaScript maintainers team?
