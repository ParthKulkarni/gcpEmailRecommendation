Personally I would recommend removal, especially since most (but not
all) malware is not DFSG-free. If the malware is Free Software then I
would recommend building it from source. I would guess that the source
would not trigger these various malware scanners.

Can you think of any particular examples of the type of training you
are talking about?
Personally I tend to think that the training should be done on
real-world malware from the current time in history and any package of
such malware would quickly get out of date and also be non-DFSG-free.
So training some model on Debian buildd systems would be pretty
pointless and that should instead happen on external services. There
is already quite an industry around malware, it might be interesting
for the industry to become more open, transparent and accessible to
people without money but that should happen outside Debian.
