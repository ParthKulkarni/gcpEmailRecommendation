Hello,
Here is an updated diff for this bug, against the docbook version of
the policy manual.
I've also included a purely informative change which emphasises that
packages that are team maintained in name only should be orphaned
properly, with their maintainer field set to the QA team.  This is
already current best practice, but it's worth emphasising, because one
might fail to orphan a package on the grounds that "someone else on the
team might fix it", which is not true of a lot of teams.
This purely informative change came out of a discussion at DebCamp with
h01ger, gregoa and David Bremner.  We are CCing -devel because we want
to determine if there remains, in 2017, a consensus that we should not
drop this requirement.  We think that recent objections in the bug are
about implementation details, rather than a concern to retain humans in
the uploaders field.
