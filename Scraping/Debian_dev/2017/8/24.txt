Ack, separating these questions makes sense to me.

Right, I think that's the situation that the proponents of this
change have in mind.

Here I disagree: This database would just shift the outdated
information to another place; and more generally: I fail to see which
problem it solves.
I guess this is the general difference in perception we have in this
discussion: Some people start from the idea of "responsibility of a
human for a team package" while others are happy and have good
experiences in teams where all (or enough) members take
responsibility for the team packages and feel that a "dedicated human
responsible" doesn't make sense in their workflow.
What I don't understand in the point of view of the "keep Uploaders"
proponents: What does this information, whether correct or not,
actually give others? Are they going to email or phone these persons
privately when emails to the BTS or the maintainer/team list are
ignored? And what happens if they ignore these communications as
well?

I'm sorry but this feels like loads of paperwork for active teams
with tons of package which might not need an upload each $months.
I mean, in the worst case we could script the replies to the pings but
I'd rather not go there :)
