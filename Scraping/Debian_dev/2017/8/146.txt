On most systems, people tend to disable LSM first. Because many a times
an inadequate policy hinders the use of the tool.Â And on the desktop
machine this becomes more common an issue.
On the SELinux side, there used to be a nice reporting tool for the
desktop, setroubleshoot. It used to alert (graphical and console) any
policy violations.
A DE agnostic alert tool would be necessary for wide adoption of any
LSM implementation.
In my opinion, we should start with an alert tool (to report policy
violations), and a handful of server packages.
