Seconded in Tollef's opinion.
- This affects *only* testing and unstable, not stable release (yet).
  So, most of users are not influenced.
- We *can* revert it before Buster release if it would be too much
  wrong impact for us.
- This is done in early timing for Buster Cycle. We have enough time
  to see what is going on.
So, please file bugs with real world precise examples against affected
packages, and let's fix it first.
And, if it will not be reverted, maybe we can provide alternatives
such as openssh-client-ssh1 does.
