This is entirely wrong.  The first entry in dpkg's changelog was in
1994, and rpm's first release was in 1997.
Please spend at least a little time doing research before asking
questions of a widely-read mailing list; establishing those dates took
less than a minute (tail of dpkg's debian/changelog, and looking at
RPM's Wikipedia page).

dpkg was written as part of developing Debian and was an integral part
of that development.  It wasn't a matter of looking around for an
existing system to use.
If you want to look at the history of discussions, you're welcome to
look at Debian's mailing list archives; most of the early stuff will be
on debian-devel (https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/).
