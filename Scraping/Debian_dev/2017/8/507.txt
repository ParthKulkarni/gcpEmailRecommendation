Howdy all,
I am catching up with the Linux.conf.au 2017 presentations, and have
just watched “Package Managers All the Way Down” by Kristoffer Grönlund
<URL:https://archive.org/details/lca2017-Package_Managers_all_the_way_down>,
also discussed at LWN <URL:https://lwn.net/Articles/712318/>.
The problems Kristoffer covered are ones that affect the Debian Project
a lot, and his call for solutions is interesting. Are there any DebConf
2017 presentations or working groups that are tackling this?
