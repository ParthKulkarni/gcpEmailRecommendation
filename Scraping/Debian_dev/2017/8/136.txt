Hi,
[John, there's a question for you at the bottom, but you probably have
useful input about the first part of the discussion below too.]

Thank you so much for highlighting problems I had missed! :)
A simple, but not entirely satisfying answer is:
1. Gather info about how real this problem has been in practice for
   Ubuntu: they frequently update their kernel for various already
   released distros with the latest AppArmor bits. I think they
   occasionally have to update other packages accordingly to adjust
   AppArmor policy. I don't know how often this happens. I'll ask them
   to compile a list of such stable updates.
2. Evaluate for a year how it goes for Stretch + Linux from backports.
   Desktop: I'm in a good place to provide data points, as Tails
   generally ships this combination and we exercise the vast majority
   of the desktop AppArmor stuff that's in Debian.
   Server: sorry, I use the stable kernel except on bare-metal
   virtualization hosts. But I think (1) will give us enough data on
   this front.
3. Depending on what (1) and (2) tell us, decide whether "we might
   have to update AppArmor policy from time to time in stable
   point-releases or backports" is good enoughâ€¦ keeping in mind that
   other distros are already dealing with the exact same problem, so
   we won't have to do this alone.  And if it's not good enough:

If we need to go this far: apparmor_parser has a --features-file
option that we could leverage to tie the feature set being used to
something else than the version of the running kernel, e.g.
with a file shipped in a new package built from src:linux with
appropriate versioned dependencies.

I'm not sure, so I'll let the main AppArmor kernel developer (John,
Cc'ed) answer this.
