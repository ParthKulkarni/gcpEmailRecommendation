I think it are two seperate problems. "reboot" being one, "clock" the other.
On the reboot:
Without further information on "computer" it is hard to solve the problem.
There are various generations of "ACPI"
Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface
for some background information. Match the new ACPI knowledge with the computer,
then match it with software that handles the hardware well.
On the clock:
Microsoft Windows system expect their hardware clock in the local timezone.
Linux systems do default expect the hardware clock is in UTC timezone.
There is a setting to tell the Linux system that the hardware clock is in local timezone.
Debian-Installer asks about it and set it.
For allready installed systems read https://wiki.debian.org/DateTime#Hardware_clock_and_system_time_when_dual_booting
