  Description     :  md5 on pure JavaScript
 This module implement md5 on pure javascript for browserify.

 The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit
hash value. Although  MD5 was initially designed to be used as a
cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from
extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to
verify data integrity,  but only against unintentional corruption or
to implement hash table.

 Brrowserify is a JavaScript tool that allows developers to write
Node.js-style modules that compile for use in the browser.
