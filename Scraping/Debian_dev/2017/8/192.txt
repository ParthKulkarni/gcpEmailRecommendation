Anyone interested in helping with continued support for classic window
managers should consider working on packaging for
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-menu , and perhaps forming a
maintenance team for it. And if it doesn't support your window manager
or desktop of choice, consider adding support for it.
There are a lot of people wishing there was a "transition plan", and far
fewer people actively working to create one.
