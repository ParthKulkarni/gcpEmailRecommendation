That should be changed.  Its a perfect way to exclude "Uploaders" from
beeing informed about issues with a package.

+1

I admit that at least one Uploader should be mandatory if Maintainer is
not a person.

What place would you suggest?  If I would like to know all members of
a team I would do an UDD query for all packages maintained by the team
(mailing list address) and check the list of Uploaders mentioned of
all those packages.  May be that's a biased view that works in those
teams I'm a member of.

I'm convinced that manual updating of team membership will not work.
Its the reason why I started team analysis stats 9 years ago since I
just was not able to tell who is a member of Debian Med and who is not.
 
Kind regards
