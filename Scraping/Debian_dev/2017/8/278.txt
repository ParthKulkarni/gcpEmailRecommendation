Long-Description:
 Spyder plugin to use Jupyter notebooks inside Spyder. Currently it
 supports basic functionality such as creating new notebooks, opening any
 notebook in your filesystem and saving notebooks at any location.
 .
 You can also use Spyder's file switcher to easily switch between
 notebooks and open an IPython console connected to the kernel of a
 notebook to inspect its variables in the Variable Explorer.
This package will be maintained by the Debian Science Team, alongside
spyder and the rest of the spyder plugins.
