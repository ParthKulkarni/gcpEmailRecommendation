Erm, rereading my text, I misspoke a bit, I meant the opposite of
what I said:
 - apt-get / aptitude leave /var/cache/apt/archives lying around
 - apt doesn't

For aptitude I have no idea, haven't used that in quite a while.
For the apt and apt-get utilities there's the following explanation
in /usr/share/doc/apt/NEWS.Debian.gz:
  [ Automatic removal of debs after install ]
  After packages are successfully installed by apt(8),
  the corresponding .deb package files will be
  removed from the /var/cache/apt/archives cache directory.
  This can be changed by setting the apt configuration option
    "Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages" to "true". E.g:
  # echo 'Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages "true";' \
      > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01keep-debs
  Please note that the behavior of apt-get is unchanged. The
  downloaded debs will be kept in the cache directory after they
  are installed. To enable the behavior for other tools, you can set
  "APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages" to false.
The corresponding changelog entry for 1.2~exp1 is not quite as
obvious, so I should have probably referenced NEWS and not
changelog in my message, sorry about that:
  * Add new APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages option (Closes: #160743)

Sorry, I was pretty sure it was in there, but after looking
through them you're right: it's not in there. But it was
mentioned by the APT developers towards the end of the
Jessie release cycle - I can't find anyting in
debian-devel-announce about that either though. Maybe it was
in the DebConf15 talk about APT?
