If this is your position, then your position on the unrar scenario
should logically be that putting the non-free components on a server

There is no need to dig and examine. Bas has provided all the context
that is necessary.

I probably share your point of view rather than Bas', but the way you
represent it is a disservice. It makes you look silly and for some
reason unwilling to address Bas core argument.
