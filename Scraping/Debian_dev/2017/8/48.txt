The lists on alioth are hardly accurate. Also, as you say:

This and in combination that team information is not in an defined
location makes it quite hard to find useful, accurate information.
Not mentioning that there is no way to do an lookup in which teams
someone is; so there is no way to trigger them to act when e.g someone
has left the project and did not clean up after them.
Some time ago I did some spring cleaning going over DDs that have
retired but still in the Maintainer/Uploader fields: There were quite a
 lot "team maintained" packages where the team did not recognize that
the (sole) Uploader wasn't there anymore and the packages were
bitrotting. Without the Uploader field there would have been excactly
zero change to find those packages and get them back into maintainance
again.

Removing the requirement won't help here either; It would just mask
this fact and makes it harder for other parties to detect this.
I think the "how can I contact somone on the team" could be fixed, like
(brainstomring) e.g by a Team-Contact field in d/control with an human
contact and formalizing requirements on a Team so that they are allowed
to drop the Uploaders -- if they fulfill this requirements. One
requirement could be e.g  that the team has a site on the Wiki and we
need some central place to record the team members and a mandatory
enrollment process (like the yearly team member ping that the perl team
does, AFAIK)

This is not the point I wanted to make: In my experience if there is
NOT a name tacked to an task, the likelyhood of noone will feel
responsible and the task not done is very high.

Relates to the "if there is no name attached to a task" thing explained
above.Â 
Also mind that we really do not have processes at hand to handle those
situations. The MIA team has already now no actual power on "partially
MIA" situations, but in the past it often helped to write a nice mail.
If I write to the anonymity of a team mailing list, I guess those mails
will be more easily ignored.
