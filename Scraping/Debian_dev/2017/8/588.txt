Dear all,
I have been writing some beginner articles in my spare-time to
talk/share about Debian and make it more popular.
In that direction I have and had been penning few articles at
https://itsfoss.com/author/shirish/
As shared before, these are beginner articles and are meant only to
bring awareness about Debian to the masses.
Just a few days back, Debian turned 24
https://bits.debian.org/2017/08/debian-turns-24.html
While I have been thinking about sharing the number of packages, the
number of developers, the diversity, the debconf's and where debconfs
have been held over the years for starters but all of these I have
already shared before.
I saw hartmann's article on p.d.o. the other day
http://hartmans.livejournal.com/96841.html and I started pondering
about some of the lesser unknown innovative ideas of debian which
people don't know about.
For e.g. the reproducible builds project
https://reproducible-builds.org/ seems to have a lot of weight and
faith of DD's but is not known at all (or maybe some slightly bit)
outside the technical circles.
Are there any such unsung technical/non-technical or social
innovations that Debian has done that is now known/or lesser known
which Debianities should know about and be proud about. Having more
Debian fanboys should also increase both participation and
contribution to Debian.
As far as fact-checking goes, can anybody share about Debian and Kali
Linux relationship in bit more detail. AFAIK Raphaël Hertzog is one of
the main developers and there has been lot of symbiotic relationship
between the two projects but how much both projects have benefited
from this partnership has not been codified or told/shared anywhere
AFAIK.
The only thing I could get is
https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian which
seems to be pretty dry and short as far as documentation goes.
Looking forward to knowing more.
