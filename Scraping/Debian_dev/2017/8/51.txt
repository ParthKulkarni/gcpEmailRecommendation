agreed as well.
Then, Tobias has a point, knowing which team members uploaded a package is
useful. So I have a simple proposal to achieve that: make tracker.d.o
show the last 10 uploaders for a given package (based on UDD), just like it
parses the Uploaders: field from the packages now.
And probably some pages where all uploading team members of given teams are
shown.
