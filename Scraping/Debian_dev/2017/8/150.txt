I have Ubuntu running on another box. I haven't had any trouble (to my knowledge) that has been caused from apparmor. Ubuntu being perceived as an entry OS for linux, I would think Canonical wouldn't have included it if it would introduce pain to desktop users. What sort of "pain" might apparmor cause?
I assumed apparmor was also on debian. If it isn't, doesn't this make Ubuntu significantly more secure than a debian installation?

My point is that it hasn't so far and Ubuntu and SUSE has had millions
of people using it for a decade, more or less.
