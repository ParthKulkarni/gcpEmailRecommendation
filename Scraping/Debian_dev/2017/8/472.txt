Package: wnpp
Severity: wishlist
After discussions at Debconf17, it was suggested that I should package for 
Debian the pocket-home program that forms the lightweight home menu of the 
pocketCHIP device.  It is GPL3+ and the most maintained upstream is 
<https://github.com/o-marshmallow/PocketCHIP-pocket-home>.
This package is already useful on the pocketCHIP (which runs Debian) but 
would be useful on other low-power, low-resolution, touch-friendly devices 
as well.
It is my intention not only to maintain this package, but also to work with 
upstream on improvements as they are discovered to make this program more 
useful on other target devices.
