  Description     : PDF reader in JavaScript
 This JavaScript library provides a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that
 is built with HTML5. This project aims to provide a general-purpose, web
 standards-based platform for parsing and rendering PDFs.
This JS library is being packaged as a build dependency of gitea (a gogs fork).
There are a lot of build dependencies and I would love some help. If anyone is
interested in handling this package, please feel free to contact me!
