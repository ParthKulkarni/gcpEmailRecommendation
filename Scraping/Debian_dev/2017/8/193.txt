There's an ITP for xdg-menu(-convert): #807241
And beginnings of a package at https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-perl/packages/xdg-menu-convert.git
Unfortunately Nicholas doesn't seem to be active currently, so I
guess it's ok to take over the ITP and continue from the initial
packaging, if this helps.
Cheers,
gregor
