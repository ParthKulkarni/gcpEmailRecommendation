Hi -devel,
Since [0], failing the following Lintian tag will now cause your
upload to be rejecting by the Debian archive software:
  Tag: latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date
  Severity: important
  Certainty: certain
  Info: The latest Debian changelog entry has either the same or even an
   older date as the entry before.
   .
   This can result in subtle bugs due to the <tt>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</tt>
   environment variable being the same between the older and newer
   versions.
This is to address #873489 [1]. There is more rationale available in
the thread from one of our users [2].
The current version of Lintian in buster/sid (2.5.52) emits this as
a warning ("W:") but the next version — pending release — will emit
this as an error ("E:") [3].
(If you believe other tags should be auto-rejected, please open
a suitable wishlist bug against the "ftp.debian.org" BTS pseudo-
package. You can read more about Lintian autorejects on the
ftpmaster webpages [4].)
