  Description     : better desktop integration for Riot.im
Revolt is a small application which wraps the Riot.im webapp to provide better
integration with desktop environments in general, and GNOME in particular:
   * Having Riot as a “standalone” application with its own window, launcher,
     icon, etc. instead of it living in a browser tab.
   * Persistent notifications (for desktop environments supporting them, i.e.
     GNOME). Notifications are automatically prevented when the Revolt window
     is focused.
   * Status icon for desktop environment which have a tray bar applet (XFCE,
     Budgie, likely many others).
Riot.im is a chat client for Matrix, an open, federated communications
protocol.
