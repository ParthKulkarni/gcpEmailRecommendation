  Description     : Go string conversions for numeric types
 This package contains string conversion function and is written in Go.
 It is much alike the standard library's strconv package, but it is
 specifically tailored for the performance needs within the
 github.com/tdewolff/minify package.
 .
 For example, the floating-point to string conversion function is
 approximately twice as fast as the standard library, but it is not
 as precise.
Reason for packaging:
 Required by github.com/tdewolff/minify,
 which in turn is likely needed by Hugo in the near future.
 .
 See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3761
 and https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3760
 .
 /usr/bin/minify is also an interesting and useful tool in its own right.
