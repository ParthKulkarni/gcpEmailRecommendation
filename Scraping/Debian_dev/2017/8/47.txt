Hello Tobias,
Thank you for writing about this bug from the MIA team's perspective,
which is very relevant to resolving this.

In most teams, this happens anyway -- I would take this as an argument
against team maintenance more generally.

For teams on alioth, would you find the list of team members on the
alioth project insufficient?
I agree this doesn't help with teams that do not use alioth but are
based around a mailing list.
As Adrian said, it's not clear what an alternative to Uploaders would
be for this purpose.  But I'm not sure that Uploaders is much use,
either, because in so many teams it's simply not kept up-to-date.

Right, but having some random team members listed in Uploaders: doesn't help.

Could you explain further how this would amplify the problem?  I agree
that this is a serious problem, but I don't see how this change would
amplify it.
