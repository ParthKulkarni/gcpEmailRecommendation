That completely misses the problem.
If the team has remaining members, and one of these members knows that 
no-one in the team is actively taking care of a package, then what
happens afterwards is obvious.
Finding unmaintained packages is the hard part.
In a bigger team maintaining 500 packages it is a non-trivial amount of 
extra work searching for packages no-one inside the team is actively 
taking care of.
In a small team with 2 members maintaining 1 package, what you write 
obviously cannot work when the last team member becomes MIA.
With Uploaders you are able to see when all uploaders are retired/MIA,
either inside the team or from outside when the team has no active 
members left.
