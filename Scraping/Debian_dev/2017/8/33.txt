I think using the uploaders: field to guess who's a team member is just a
work-around / an estimate, as we have nothing better. Yet it's very often
inaccurate as eg src:debian-edu shows, which at least I don't keep accurate
as I dont want to remove people unneccessarily (can be seen as stepping on 
their toes), have added people who will not upload (because currently this
field is indeed abused to generate team member metadata) and sometimes 
people were even added even though they don't want to belong to the team.
;tl;dr: I think we need a better system to manage team membership in Debian.
(Ab)using the uploaders: field gives an estimate or datapoint today, but we
have other means to gather this data.
