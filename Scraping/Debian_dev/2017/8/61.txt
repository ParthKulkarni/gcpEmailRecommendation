As I already tried to explain, this is an easy part that could be
automated. The half-year MIA process that follows is the bottleneck,
and wasting slots on teams would make the bottleneck even worse.

This is how you imagine how teams should work, not a description of the
actual reality in Debian.
As an example, we do have teams that define in their policy the
semantics for "person in Maintainer, team in Uploaders".

It is interesting how you manage to argue both based on a very specific 
definition of teams you have in mind, and based on declaring that all 
this is not well-defined and that we neither can nor want to define it.
What is needed is a machine-readable mapping between teams and their members.
Mandatory Uploaders gives a good-enough approximation of that.
Removing that without replacement would be a regression.

Declaring someone is MIA is the result of a half-year process.[1]
Doing a MIA process for a team many years (and several releases)
after it has been confirmed that all team members are MIA would
both lower the quality of Debian and create additional work.
You are trying to push the solution of making Uploaders optional
for teams, marginalizing any new problems it might cause.
Let's go back from trying to push a solution to discussing the problems 
that should be solved, and the problems different potential solutions 
might cause.
I do understand that for teams whose policy states that every team 
member maintains every package and that maintain many packages it
is not convenient to manually update uploaders. Is this the one
problem that should be solved, or are there other problems that
should be solved here?
An alternative option of maintaining machine-readable information
about team member in a different place outside the packages would
fix the problem of losing information about team membership.
Or the low-change option of documenting that the already used way of 
autogenerating the Uploaders list based on information stored in one 
core package of the team is a valid option - this allows teams with many 
packages to get rid of the problem of having to update this information 
manually in every single package.
