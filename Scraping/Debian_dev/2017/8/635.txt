Dear Audrey,
Please CC me. I read
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/08/msg00600.html
My mistake, I assumed the package was named lcdproc and not
pkg-config-model which the package is all about. Sorry for being a bit
incoherent, just not in the best of the health.
I had seen the page https://wiki.debian.org/PackageConfigUpgrade and
had to read it twice before understanding that the package it talks
about is pkg-config.model.
I do agree with your assessment and I imagine it might take quite a
bit of work. That is why I am against blindly taking maintainer
changes and usually cancel updates which have a diff. or need me to
take a decision on a later/next day morning where I'll be more fresh
and have time to see what is best for my setup.
