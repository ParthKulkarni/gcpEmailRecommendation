The https://release.debian.org/transitions/ lists in
"Ongoing transitions":
  auto-golang-goleveldb (100%)
  auto-libratbag (100%)
which are actually finished. And in "(almost) Finished transitions",
one can see:
  auto-libevent (5%)
which has 3 packages in "good", 2 packages in "partial", and
60 packages in "bad"!
