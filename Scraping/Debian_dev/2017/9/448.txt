  Description     : documentation for expeyes and python-expeyes
formerly, the packages expeyes-doc-* were released as
architecture-independant binaries, from the source package
expeyes.
Considering that:
- the source for the documentation comes from a separate
  repository,
- the size of the documentation and its compilation time
  are important,
- the packaging of expeyes is growing more complex due to new
  upstream improvements,
it makes sense to split out a source package named expeyes-doc
I am the regular maintainer for expeyes, and shall be the
regular maintainer for expeyes-doc.
