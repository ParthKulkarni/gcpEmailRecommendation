As much as it rubs me the wrong way, I don't see many reasons to avoid creating
this. In fact, the only reason I have is that it could encourage people to
think fcgi is okay to use.
This virtual package could probably be satisfied by libapache2-mod-fcgid,
fcgiwrap, or spawn-fcgi. I believe fcgiwrap has some systemd magic-sauce that
would, in theory, provide a relatively simple way for apps to listen on a
well-known unix-socket path (similar to the way uwsgi works).
Personally, I always recommend uwsgi over any of the avaialable cgi/fastcgi
servers, such as php-fpm, ruby-fcgi, python-fcgi, etc. When you have uwsgi
available, and it's capable of handling all those languages, including legacy
raw-cgi apps, it seems kinda silly to use anything else. ;)
(even mailman runs great behind it..)
