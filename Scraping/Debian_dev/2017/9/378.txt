This program is similar to Workrave, but written in Python and without
the questionable 3D art. It is also simpler: it doesn't track
keystrokes and is more easily extensible.
I've been a happy user for a few weeks now - it's really nice that the
popup is a fullscreen black thing instead of a small popup: it means
you are not distracted by whatever you're doing.
I'm open to co-maintainership on this or would gladly let someone else
take it if people are interested.
