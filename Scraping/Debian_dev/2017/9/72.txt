Other Info
--------------
PipeWire [1] is an optional dependency of mutter 3.26 to enable
experimental Remote Desktop support in GNOME on Wayland. But its
ambitions are greater: "PipeWire now aims at unifying linux Audio and
Video." [2]
The author gave a talk recently at GUADEC about PipeWire. [3]
The Debian GNOME team intends to maintain this package.
Work-in-progress packaging is at
