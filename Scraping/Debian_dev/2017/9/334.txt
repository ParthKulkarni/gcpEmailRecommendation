Package: wnpp
The current maintainer of bash-completion, David Paleino
<dapal@debian.org> (Cc'ed), currently lacks time to work on this
package and granted the MIA team to orphan his packages as necessary.
Maintaining a package requires time and skills. Please only adopt this
package if you will have enough time and attention to work on it.
If you want to be the new maintainer, please see
https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/#howto-o for detailed
instructions how to adopt a package properly.

Description-en: programmable completion for the bash shell
 bash completion extends bash's standard completion behavior to achieve
 complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.  This project was
 conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most
 common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins
 and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
