Contributers should be able to self-organise within the project and for many dds email is their primary means of communication. Sure you can just cc everyone involved but then there is no archive and no way for new contributers to jump in.

I am willing to step up to help keep lists.alioth.debian.org running
as a standalone service using mailman. It seems like it is yet to be
resolved whether this is a long-term strategic option, but this
thread demonstrates the many practical reason that we should aim to
maintain it beyond February 2018. Maintaining the current service
separated out from Alioth would, it appears, reduce the impact on the
project of the alioth switch-off considerably. The main requirements/
issues seem to be:
- retaining archives (ideally with consistent URLs)
- retaining the email addresses in many maintainer fields
- short-term uncertainty about replacements for certain use cases
I have managed mailman installations for some time so I'm fairly familiar
with how it works, and have some time from November onwards to work on
this which I hope would be enough time to develop and implement a migration
plan. I'm CCing the alioth and DSA teams so they are aware of this.
Thanks,
Dominic.
