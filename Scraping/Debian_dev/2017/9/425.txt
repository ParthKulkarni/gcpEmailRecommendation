Dear fellow Debianauts,
right now I am in the process of migrating my selection of manually installed packages to a freshly debootstrapped install using a set of meta-packages built with equivs. While that works nice and well, in some instances, I would like to limit the number of recommends being pulled in, without turning recommends off completely (the meta-packages themselves use Recommends:dependencies). So the --no-install-recommends parameter or APT::Install-Recommends "0" are of no help in this case.
Any ideas how to block installation of only some packages' recommendations?
