  Description     : Mission Oriented Operating Suite
Light, fast, cross-platform middleware for robotics. CoreMOOS is the most
fundamental layer, providing a very robust network based communications
architecture (two libraries and a lightweight communications hub called
MOOSDB) which for very little effort lets you build applications which
communicate with each other.
This software is often used in marine robotics, but users typically run
from source. This is an attempt to rectify that situation, at least for
Debian-based distributions. I'm planning on maintaining it, although
co-maintainers would not be turned down. I have a sponsor.
