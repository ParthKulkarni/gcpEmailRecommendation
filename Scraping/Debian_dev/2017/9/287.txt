  Description     : Compile class and object decorators to ES5 (legacy)
 A plugin for Babel 6 that (mostly) replicates the old decorator behavior from Babel 5.
 Babel is a JavaScript compiler to use next generation JavaScript, today.
 ES2015 and beyond: Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript
 through syntax transformers. These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right
 now without waiting for browser support.
 Note: This library is in contrib because it needs node-babel from contrib to
 build.
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
