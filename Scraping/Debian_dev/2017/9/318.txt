Hum, that documentation is a bit outdated. What you have to use is
actually dispatch+<package>@tracker.debian.org. But I would not want
people to use this email address in Maintainer fields.
Instead we should use <package>@packages.debian.org. But for this we
need a lintian upload and a lintian backport to be installed on
ftp-master:
