Would any of those solutions also email the uploaders or recent people
in d/changelog? This would be helpful for NMU as well as for
team-maintained packages in a large team.
For example, I am part of the Debian Python Modules Team but there are
so many packages that I can't follow the mailing list. Therefore, I miss
bugs from "my" packages due to the "noise". I still catch RC bugs by
looking at the maintainer dashboard, but for anything else...
