Any reason you couldn't create a binary package (suil-binaries) and then
two virtual packages (suil-qt and suil-gtk) which had the appropriate
dependencies on the necessary toolkit? Presumably suil would need to be
configured as appropriate to load the right underlying toolkit, that
could be done with alternatives? Another virtual package (suil) could
then depend on suil-qt or suil-gtk as desired to select a suitable
default, probably gtk (given our current default desktop).
Users could then install suil-qt instead to get a version suitable for
use in a qt-dominant environment.
