Our completely arbitrary internal deadline for signing up to mentor is
upon us! Please finish submitting project ideas and mentorship proposals.
https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round15/Projects
Interested in participating, but not sure what to do? Feel free to mail
outreach@debian.org or message tmarble or me (mollydb) on IRC to talk
about your ideas.
If you want to help, but aren't sure you can put in the time you want
to, consider asking someone if they need a co-mentor for their project.
Thanks everyone!
Cheers,
mdb
