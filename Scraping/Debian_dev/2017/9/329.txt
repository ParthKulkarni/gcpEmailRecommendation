Last non-NMU upload happened 3 years ago and version in sid is 2.1.
Development seems to be moved over to Github 
(https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/). Latest release there is 2.7 
from last July.
Why does Alioth site for bash-completion still exists and why doesn't it 
mention the Github repo? Why did Debian packaging activity stop?
