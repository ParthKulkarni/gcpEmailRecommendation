Agreed. However, there is a good chance that lists.alioth.debian.org
will be replaced by a gazillion of lists.randomdd.example instances,
none of them lasting "forever", only wasting valuable resources that
could better be spent with package maintainence and enhancing Debian's
excellence.
Not doing something "central" just because it won't be perfect, or not
supported by DSA, will not prevent things from happening, it will just
force them to happen in a distributed, uncoordinated way, wasting way
more resources for something technically inferior in many different
ways.
Greetings
