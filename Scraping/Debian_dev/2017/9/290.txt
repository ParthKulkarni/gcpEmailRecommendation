Good evening! I spent last week seeking for some good Linux distro and 
after I have installed Ubuntu Gnome (bugged), Mint (wifi didn't work) 
and Debian 9.1.0 pure and that didn't work for me either I have issues 
because the firmware for my network card, but fortunately I have succeed 
in found your instructions about Debian Live with non free firmware and 
now I'm a happy new member of Debian comunity with my Debian 9.1.0 
stretch Live work properly, so please do not stop the production of 
Debian Live in the next distributions.
Yours
