  Description     : Flightradar24 Decoder & Feeder lets you effortlessly share ADS-B data with Flightradar24. It supports multiple receivers, the DVB-T stick, and makes the entire feeding process as smooth as possible.
We at Flightradar24.com offer our feeders software for x86 / ARM Linux platforms which we currently package as .deb packages through our own APT repository.
As our userbase grows, we thought that it might be better for our users to skip manual step of adding yet another repository to their system.
Therefore we ask if it would be possible to include our feeder package to the non free part of Debian repository.
Majority of our users run the software on Raspbian OS on Raspberry Pi. However, we aim to support any Debian-based OS, including Debian itself and Ubuntu.
We plan to maintain and support the package ourselves as a company.
