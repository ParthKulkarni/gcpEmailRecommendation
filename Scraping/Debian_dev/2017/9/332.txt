Powerlevel9k is a theme for zsh which uses powerline fonts
Get more out of your terminal. Be a badass. Impress everyone in
'Screenshot Your Desktop' threads. Use powerlevel9k.
There are a number of Powerline ZSH themes available, now. The developers of
this theme focus on four primary goals:
 - Give users a great out-of-the-box configuration with no additional
   configuration required.
 - Make customization easy for users who do want to tweak their prompt.
 - Provide useful segments that you can enable to make your prompt even more
   effective and helpful. We have prompt segments for everything from unit
   test coverage to your AWS instance.
 - Optimize the code for execution speed as much as possible. A snappy
   terminal is a happy terminal.
 - Powerlevel9k can be used to create both very useful and beautiful
   terminal environments.
