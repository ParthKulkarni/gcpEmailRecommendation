  Description     : Python interface to the GNU R language and environment
 This Debian package provides RPy2, a very simple yet robust Python interface
to the GNU R Programming Language. It can manage different types of R objects,
and can execute arbitrary R functions, including graphic functions. Rpy2 is a
rewrite and extension of the older RPy interface.
 Rpy2 is already in Debian, however Rpy2 2.9 no longer supports Python 2, so
the Python 2 package was recently removed from Debian. Since sagemath depends
on rpy2 while using Python 2, this package reintroduces the Python 2 version of
Rpy2, based on the 2.8 series.
