How high are the requirements (CPU-, Memory) wise? I guess that one of
those 5 Euros a month VPSses with 50 Gig Disk and 8 GB RAM would not
be enough?
Unfortunately, my own virtualization box that has ample free resources
does not have IPv4. Would it be possible to have a Debian.org host
relay messages coming in via IPv4? Do we have a chance to share spam
filtering resources with lists.debian.org?
I don't see running the Mailing list server the biggest challenge.
Providing an acceptable spam filter is.
Greetings
Marc, willing to help
