Thanks for the heads up!
It's not declared orphaned, but it should be: David, the maintainer of
the bash-completion package currently doesn't have time for it. I'm
cc'ing him and the bash-completion packaging mailing list.
David: Since you granted the MIA team to orphan your packages as
necessary, and since you seem to be the only bash-completion team
member, I plan to declare bash-completion as orphaned officially after
this mail. I hope you're still fine with that.
