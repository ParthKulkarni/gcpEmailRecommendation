So, not discussing about usefulness or not but practical aspects:
- chroots would also log in the machine journal, which is wrong
- same for some other weird temporary chroot thingies
- term.log might contain sensitive data that should not be
  easily available (I think)
- dpkg.log and update-alternatives.log are more detailed step-by-step
  logs.
Maybe someone on debian-devel has some more opinion, but I'm not sure
if it is worthwhile pursuing this.
