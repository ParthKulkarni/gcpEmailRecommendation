  Description     : Colored, incremental diff with side by side and auto pager support
 Cdiff is a terminal based tool to view colored, incremental diff in a
 Git/Mercurial/Svn workspace or from stdin, with side by side and auto
 pager support.
This is Build-Depends for patroni, which I am also packaging. It will
have to conflict with colordiff as both ship /usr/bin/cdiff.
