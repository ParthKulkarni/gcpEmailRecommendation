  Description     : Golang library to handle locking via pid files
 Package lockfile handles pid file based locking. While a sync.Mutex helps
 against concurrency issues within a single process, this package is designed
 to help against concurrency issues between cooperating processes or
 serializing multiple invocations of the same process. You can also combine
 sync.Mutex with Lockfile in order to serialize an action between different
 goroutines in a single program and also multiple invocations of this program.
This is a new dependency for prometheus 2.0.
