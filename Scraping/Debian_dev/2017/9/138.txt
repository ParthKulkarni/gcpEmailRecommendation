  Description     : Bro Package Manager
The Bro Package Manager makes it easy for Bro users to install and manage third
party scripts as well as plugins for Bro and BroControl. The command-line tool
is preconfigured to download packages from the Bro package source, a GitHub
repository that has been set up such that any developer can request their Bro
package be included.
The package extends the functionality of the already packaged bro network
analysis software.
I would volunteer to maintain the package and already prepared a basic package.
