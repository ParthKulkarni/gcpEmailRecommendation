Just because a team isn't big or established doesn't mean they don't need a place to discuss issues relating to their activities, some of which do not relate to any one particular package.

Sure you can just cc everyone involved but then there is no archive and no way for new contributers to jump in.
I find the current proposal to drop alioth mailing lists without a real replacement to be a major step backwards.
