These are a few numbers regarding affected source packages using
an alioth mail address (find script attached):
$ schroot -c sid perl count-alioth-packages.pl
     88 alioth addresses have       0 < packages <=       1
    140 alioth addresses have       1 < packages <=      10
     66 alioth addresses have      10 < packages <=     100
     16 alioth addresses have     100 < packages <=    1000
      6 alioth addresses have    1000 < packages <=   10000
      0 alioth addresses have   10000 < packages <=  100000
Cheers,
Alex
