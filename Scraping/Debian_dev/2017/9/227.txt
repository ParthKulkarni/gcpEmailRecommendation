  Description     : Command line parsing for Emacs
 (upstream does not yet have a long description).
 .
 Commander is an emacs addons that provides an alternative method for
 specifying functions to run.  For example, to run a custom "foo"
 function with "emacs -- foo arg1 [arg2] [etc]", define the command
 foo with at least one required argument:
 .
       (commander
         (command "foo <*>" "Foo" fn))
This package is a dependency of ert-runner, which seems to be
needed for elpy's self-tests.
As with 875722, I plan to maintain it as part of pkg-emacsen, and I
will require a sponsor for the initial upload.
Regards,
Nicholas
