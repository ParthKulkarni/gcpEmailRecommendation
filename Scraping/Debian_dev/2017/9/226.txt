  Description     : Opinionated Ert testing workflow
 Ert-runner is a tool for Emacs projects tested using Ert. It assumes
 a certain test structure setup and can therefore make running tests
 easier.
I am in the process of packaging ert-runner, because elpy's tests seem
to depend on it (100% failure rate at present).  My hope is that
configuring a directive for ert-runner will remove the necessity to patch 140-something (300-something by ert's count) tests in elpy.
Be it resolved that elpy's tests truly depend on ert-runner, I plan to
maintain it as part of the pkg-emacsen team.  At this time I will need a sponsor for the initial upload.
Regards,
Nicholas
