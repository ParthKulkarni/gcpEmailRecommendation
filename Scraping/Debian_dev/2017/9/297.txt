Sure you can just cc everyone involved but then there is no archive and no way for new contributers to jump in.
agreed.

fully agreed.
However, I also fully understand and support the decision of those who want to
maintain git.debian.org (or whatever the DNS name will be) in future, that
they don't want to migrate+run lists.alioth.debian.org as well.
So given all that, I would also applaud other people who want to keep
lists.alioth.d.o running. (As one third of all binary packages in main 
currently use such an address in the maintainers or uploaders fieldâ€¦ (*))
