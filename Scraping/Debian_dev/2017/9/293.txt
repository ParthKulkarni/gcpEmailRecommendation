Hello,
thanks for the heads-up.
The maintainer e-mail address is listed not only on packages.debian.org
but also on "dpkg -s ..." et. al. Users send support e-mail there. Imho
either the mailing lists need to run a lot longer (possibly until
stretch EOL) or (prefered) the old list-address should redirect to the
new one.

Would it be possible to keep the list-archives online, indexed by
search-engines? These are static pages, aren't they? There is some
interesting information there and removal from the web makes it hard
to find.
