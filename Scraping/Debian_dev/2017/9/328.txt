  Description     : Volume Development library
 A small opengl C++ library for 3D and 4D volume rendering. This is
 implemented using 3D textures and fragment shaders. The library is
 relatively simple compared to major frameworks, and is aimed at both
 learners, and those who wish to integrate this functionality into their
 own projects.
 This will be an optional dependence for the upcoming 3Depict 0.0.21 release. This is being maintained as a member of the debian-science team
