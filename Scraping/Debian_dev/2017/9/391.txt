  Description     : Take actions when specific devices appear/disappear from your LAN
 lapdog is a service that monitors the presence/absence of the devices on your
 LAN and executes some actions accordingly.
 .
 It pings the devices to discover if they are connected or not. And uses their
 MAC address and not their IP, so it works on networks with DHCP.
More details:
Works nicely with laptops: it can be configured to only activate itself when
the machine sees a certain gateway, so on new networks it will not do anything.
I already created a debian branch on git with the packaging stuff.
I find the package quite useful especially to turn off the lights when I leave
home, suspend my computer and similar things.
It's extremely configurable and can be used for many more things.
