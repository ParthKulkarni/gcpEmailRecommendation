Hi Bill,
You'd be better off asking for support on the debian-user list in
future (in CC).
I'm curious how you've managed to get to that message - if you're
installing from debian-9.1.0-i386-netinst, that's exactly the disc the
system is asking for. How have you done your installation, please?

          note stuck to the mini-bar saying "Paul: This fridge and
          fittings are the correct way around and do not need altering"
