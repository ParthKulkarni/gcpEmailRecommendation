well, yes, but we should check this today too, just for proper builds, 
independently of reproducible builds.

well, yes, the check should be done using a local (copy of the) snapshot.d.o
database. It's also rude to upload a package built with packages not in the
archive, and we should prevent that.

yup, and we should try to catch as many automatically as we can.
