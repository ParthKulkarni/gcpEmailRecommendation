For now, I've added this to
https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/Contribute#Create_new_profiles
Once we've made progress on the documentation front (see below)
we can ensure that whatever resource we recommend documents this.

There are a number of AppArmor tutorials aimed at beginners. We link
to a few of them on https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor#External_links.
but the mere fact that there are 7 of them, with greatly overlapping
content and no indication of who the target audience is, suggests we
don't have a good answer to your question yet.
So I've filed #874873 (severity: important) to keep this on our radar.
Thanks for caring,
cheers!
