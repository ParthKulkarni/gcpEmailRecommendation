I don't think there is any fundamental reason for mailman to need root
access, so maybe that is an option. Of course the MTA and web
server interfaces need to be properly configured.
Alternatively, can the Debian project provide infrastructure that DSA
doesn't manage for this? I would really hope so.
Alternatively, if joining DSA is an option, I would also consider this.
(It's been in the back of my mind as something I could contribute for
most of the time I've been in Debian, but I've never been quite brave
enough to mention it before.)
I see these as all soluble issues that needs to be part of a discussion
between all involved parties, but at this stage (not least because I'm
about to go on vac) I'm mostly interested about whether in principle
this is something that the project would like.
Cheers,
Dominic.
