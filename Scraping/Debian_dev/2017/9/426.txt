I assume that adding Breaks or Conflicts to your meta-packages for the
packages you do not like should do the trick. You can even go one step
further and add Provides for the cases where the packages you do not
like are Depended on by some package in Debian. For example some
desktops may Depend on CD/DVD related tools but your computer might
not have a CD/DVD drive. With versioned Provides now being supported
you can even prevent versioned Depends being installed.
