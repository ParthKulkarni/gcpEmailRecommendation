Other Info
--------------
The Debian GNOME team intends to maintain this package.
Since gtk4 is still in beta development and we aren't aware of any
apps that require gtk4 yet, we will be uploading this to experimental.
Packaging is currently in svn at
svn://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-gnome/desktop/unstable/gtk+4.0/
