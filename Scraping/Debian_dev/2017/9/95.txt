  Description     : Secure GPG-based non-SMTP email and large file transfer
Secure GPG-based non-SMTP email and large file transfer. Has a wxPython GUI
that resembles Thunderbird. Can send multi-gigabyte attachments in chunks over
clearnet, Tor, i2p. Anyone can run a server and all servers exchange messages.
Uses a DHT for key distribution. There is a public server cluster available for
anyone to use.
Dependencies: python-wxgtk3.0 python-twisted python-enchant
  python-socks python-cryptography
I already have a working .deb package on the website. Code is all python and
GPL.
Servers have been up since 2015, Windows and MacOS clients are also available.
Uses Entangled DHT code, which is GPL, was abandoned by its author, and I
released a bugfix version. I'm going to ask for a mentor on the debian-mentors
list.
