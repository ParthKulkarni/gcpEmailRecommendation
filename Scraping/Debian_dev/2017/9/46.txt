  Description: Cross browser microtask library
  Immediate is a microtask library decended from
  NobleJS's setImmediate package and includes ideas
  from Cujo's When and RSVP package.
  .
  Immediate takes tricks from setImmedate and RSVP
  and combines them with the schedualer inspired by whens.
  .
  Tricks are tasks mentioned from setImmediate package
  which are run as necessary.

  I am not a debian member and would like to maintain this package for
a long term and would like to join the javascript maintainers group,
Praveen had agreed to sponsor this package.
