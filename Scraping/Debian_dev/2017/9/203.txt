  Description     : phylogenetic analysis with space/time models
 PHAST is a software package for comparative and evolutionary genomics.
 It consists of about half a dozen major programs, plus more than a dozen
 utilities for manipulating sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and
 genomic annotations. For the most part, PHAST focuses on two kinds of
 applications: the identification of novel functional elements, including
 protein-coding exons and evolutionarily conserved sequences; and
 statistical phylogenetic modeling, including estimation of model
 parameters, detection of signatures of selection, and reconstruction of
 ancestral sequences.
 .
 PHAST does not support phylogeny reconstruction or sequence alignment,
 and it is designed for use with DNA sequences only (see Comparison).
