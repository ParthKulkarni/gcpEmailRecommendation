Mostly these symbols are a copyright sign "©" apprearing in the license section, occasionally CJK letters in the author names. This change to dpkg should be able to solve the problem conveniently.
I can confirm that due to the same experience the d/rules template

I'd love to see this go - so +1 for UTF-8 as default.
