The latter point is moot - if we still allow binary packages that have 
been built on a maintainer machine [1] into the archive by the time
everything installed on your computer will be reproducible, this would
be a huge fail itself.
AFAIK the only place where we currently still need binary packages that 
have been built on a maintainer machine is for NEW, and after someone
has implemented a solution for that there is no blocker left for 
allowing only source-only uploads from maintainers.
