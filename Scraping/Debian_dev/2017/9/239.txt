  Description     : XPath 1.0 implementation written in Go
 goxpath is a XPath 1.0 implementation, written natively in the Go programming
 language. XPath queries XML documents, selecting elements, attributes, text,
 and has some operators and functions for manipulating strings, numbers, and
 booleans.
This is new dependency for packer 1.1.0.
I will package this inside pkg-go team and need sponsor to upload.
Thanks
