I'm afraid I don't know for sure.  I think this was probably a
weirdness on my system due to odd things I did to it, and not a bug in
any package dependencies.  When I asked apt-get to install
libpam-systemd, it upgraded a number of other packages.  I don't think
this is worth investigating further.
I think #844785 needs a fix though.  Tips for where to look would be
very welcome.
Ian.
