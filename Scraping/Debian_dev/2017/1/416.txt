I think it should be the other way around, because Release Policy
already says "Packages must autobuild from source" and it does
not say anything about failure thresholds.
In fact, I've seen maintainers downgrading FTBFS bugs that happen more
than 50% of the time.
With the lax interpretation, we could have policy reversed, as in
"packages must not build from source", and the package
would still be policy compliant!
Schr√∂dinger paradox! Packages are simultaneosly compliant with Release
Policy and with the reverse of Relese Policy!
This is why I can't trust (all) maintainers to do the right thing
regarding random FTBFS failures.
So, if you people are considering to put a piuparts-like blocking to
testing migration, please consider what will happen when the failure
happens randomly.
BTW: Your idea of an automatic RC bug would be a good start indeed,
and it's probably the least we should do.
Thanks.
