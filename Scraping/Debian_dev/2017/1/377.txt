  Description     : library for concurrent I/O with coroutines
      Curio is a library for performing concurrent I/O and common
      system programming tasks such as launching subprocesses and
      farming work out to thread and process pools. It uses Python
      coroutines and the explicit async/await syntax introduced in
      Python 3.5. Its programming model is based on cooperative
      multitasking and existing programming abstractions such as
      threads, sockets, files, subprocesses, locks, and queues. You'll
      find it to be small and fast.
