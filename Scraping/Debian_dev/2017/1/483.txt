not that this changes anything, but I assumed that
	deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-debug stretch-debug main
was the way to use for stretch+. But this does not change a thingâ€¦

No, it is still there:
    http://deb.debian.org/debian-debug/pool/main/l/linux/linux-image-4.8.0-2-amd64-dbgsym_4.8.15-2_amd64.deb
it is just not listed in the Packages file where it should be.
I *think* the archive got confused by the various kernel package. So we
have linux-image-4.8.0-2-amd64-dbgsym which comes out of src:linux and
binary:linux-image-4.8.0-2-amd64-unsigned. Then we have the binary
package linux-image-4.8.0-2-amd64 which comes out of src:linux-signed
and has no dbgsym package but the one provided by
linux-image-4.8.0-2-amd64-unsigned is just fine. I would assume that if
nothing changes, we will miss the dbgsym package in testing for 4.9 in
approx 8 days. 
There is not such a problem for mips64el where we don't have
linux-signed and so linux-image-4.8.0-2-octeon-dbgsym is listed in
testing.
Could someone from ftp please confirm this?
