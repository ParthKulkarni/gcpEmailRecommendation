Same here, as I recently needed to `dcut dm` allow for a maintainer of a
package I had been sponsoring while he went through the process.
Unfortunately, the documentation you find on extending upload permissions to
DMs doesn't tell you that only dput-ng supports the dm subcommand.
That's about the only difference I've noticed so far, so I'd be happy enough
to switch back if dput also had a dm subcommand (although truthfully, I rarely
use that anyway).
I think it's fairly confusing that there's dput and dput-ng and would love to
see functional and cli convergence so that eventually there's only one package
that supports current use cases.
