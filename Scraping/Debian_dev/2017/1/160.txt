Thanks for your reply.  I see what you mean.
The difference between our approachs seems to be whether we do the
semantic work up front, when making an upload, or later, when extracting
information by means of `git log` and `git diff`.
Based on this discussion we've been having, it seems that each of these
approaches would be advantageous for different packages, depending on
the number of patches that aren't likely to be merged upstream, and the
likelihood that someone will need a tidied patch queue of changes.
