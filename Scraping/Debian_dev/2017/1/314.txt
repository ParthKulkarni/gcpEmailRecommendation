What's the status of this? I do not like this idea, it interacts
poorly with desktops which handle upgrades via PackageKit (which
is the default) and since there are locking races in apt invoking
dpkg, it's not really a safe thing to do anyway, causing issues
like https://bugs.debian.org/850417
I'd really like to default this to disabled, and add a warning
about how it interacts with other systems and that people should
take care running apt manually when the unattended upgrades would
run, as that can break things.
I'm not subscribed to -devel, so please CC me on replies.
