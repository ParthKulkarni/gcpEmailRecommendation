Thanks to everyone for their reports.  This is very helpful.
Currently experimental has 10-3~exp2 which also has a patch from
Nikolaus Schulz to support hybrid sleep[1].  I don't use this myself
so reports on that would also be welcome.
I indeed intend to push this to sid in the next few days, with the
plan that it will be in stretch.
Thanks,
Ian.
[1] AIUI this is when your laptop suspends to RAM, but after a timeout
or when the battery is low, wakes up so that it can suspend to disk.
