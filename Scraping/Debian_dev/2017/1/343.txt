  Description     : a graphical application to model and simulate mechanical systems
OpenMeca is based on the chronoengine library. The aim of openmeca is to provide a software for simulating mechanical systems easily. openmeca allow us to builds a 3D sketch, where the bonds are represented by symbols and gives a simple way to apply loading and boundary conditions. Thanks to numerical sensors, different kind of data (force, torque, displacement, velocity, etc.) could be extracted from the simulation.
Hello, I am developing the openmeca software. openmeca is a scientific software especially designed for teaching mechanical dynamics. I started this development a long time ago (8 years) and I think that the program is correct now.
I propose to work myself on the packaging. By following the FAQ instructions, I just made a first version of the source and binary package. However, I probably need help from debian mentors to improve the quality of the package.
Best regards, Damien.
