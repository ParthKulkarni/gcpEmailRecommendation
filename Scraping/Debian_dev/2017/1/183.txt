  Description     : Human readable entropy.
Converts byte slices into human-friendly phrases. The primary purpose
is to assist with the generation of cryptographically secure
passwords. The threshold for a cryptographically secure password is
between 128 and 256 bits, which when converted to base64 is 22-43
random characters. Random characters are both difficult to remember and
subject to error when spoken or written down; slurring or sloppy
handwriting can make it difficult to recover a password.
This package is a dependency of the sia storage daemon (see ITP
#847706).
