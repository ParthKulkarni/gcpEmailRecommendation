Check out the list of bugs tagged newcomer:

A great way to find packages to work on is the how-can-i-help tool:
https://wiki.debian.org/how-can-i-help
Also, you can use the debtags site to find packages tagged as being
implemented in C/Python/Haskell. Then click through to the bugs pages.
https://debtags.debian.org/search/?q=implemented-in%3A%3Ac+implemented-in%3A%3Apython+implemented-in%3A%3Ahaskell
