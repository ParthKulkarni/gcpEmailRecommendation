Nope, I don't have systemd (and thus logind) on any of my non-virtual
machines, I don't have xserver-xorg-legacy either, yet X works fine.
I've just pulled out the oldest box I have in my junk pile (a pre-amd64
Pentium4 with Intel 82915G/GV/910GL), installed current X on it -- works
fine without logind.  Non-KMS stuff you need xorg-legacy for sounds ISAish.
On the other hand, hurd which has no KMS does need xorg-legacy.

Me neither.

I guess that "relies on logind" part is true only under systemd?  At least,
other VT manipulating tools like "open" run into permissions problem there
too.
Meow!
