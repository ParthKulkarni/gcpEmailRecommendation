Right, so the answer is that Gitlab is still an "open core" project. I
therefore repeat that I find it sad that it's being pushed as a
service for Debian to use.
I personally don't find "open core" projects to be fully free
software, even if they follow current DFSG, OSI, and FSF criteria. I
may be in a minority with that view, of course.
