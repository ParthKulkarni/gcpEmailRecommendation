I thought I had to mention this tool:
https://rgeissert.blogspot.fr/2015/08/updates-to-sourcesdebiannet-editor.html
It's similar to what github offers with its web-based editor, except
it will produce a patch ready to be emailed, instead of a pull
request (also, it handles editing multiple files).
There's probably a lot to do to improve this tool, but might be a good
start for people wanting to fix typos and small glitches from their
browser.
