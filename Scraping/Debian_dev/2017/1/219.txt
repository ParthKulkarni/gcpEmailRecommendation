  Description     : transparent and symmetric Remote Python Call library
 RPyC (pronounced as are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent
 python library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering and
 distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that
 employs pythonâ€™s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between
 processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they
 were local.
I intend to package this within in Python modules team and look for a sponsor
there. It is a dependency of flexget (ITP: #724718).
