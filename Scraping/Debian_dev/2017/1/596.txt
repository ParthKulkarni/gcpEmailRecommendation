I have been looking at the GitLab instance hosted at FOSS Community
India's servers, <URL:https://git.fosscommunity.in/>. It's been working
fine for a few months.
Do the FOSS Community India people want us to make larger use of that
GitLab instance for general Debian code bases?

I believe the GitLab running at the above URL is entirely free software.

I would agree that the Debian BTS is important to maintain as the
primary bug reporting system for the Debian Project, in general. Even if
other platforms offer their own separate BTS, we strongly direct people
to the Debian BTS and it is important to have that as a first-class
venue for discussing bug reports.
