As someone who tried to make unofficial jessie for x32, I say: hell yeah,
oh so much please do this!  Or better yet, just drop that concept altogether
and instead make binNMUs automated _sourceful_ uploads.
For someone who's trying to simulate testing/stable at home, inconsistent
binNMU versions create such a mess that, despite jessie-x32 being mostly
done, you didn't hear it announced, I didn't bother to build security
updates as planned, it's a bitch to upgrade to unstable, and I'm not trying
that again for stretch.
So here's another reason for your idea, and why binNMUs are bad.
Meow!
