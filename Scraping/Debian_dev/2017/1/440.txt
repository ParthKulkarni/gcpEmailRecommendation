As on my deprecation example: I *want* to have autopkgtest failing when
a deprecation warning appears. I also want to keep the failure until it
is solved, so I would not like to just override it.
It is just a non-critical CI test failure.
BTW, this was just the simplest example. Others (in python-astropy f.e.)
are internal tests that no warnings were written during a certain
test. This will fail if a deprecation warning pops up (even if not
written to stderr), but is still non-critical.
If I would need to limit the CI tests to critical ones, I would probably
switch them off completely: most of the failures I experienced so far
are not critical at all. But this would be counterproductive.
Best regards
