Nice to see that the introduction includes Debian mailing lists.
Communicating with others of the "tribe" is essential for the "tribe".
That we haven't yet seen the students on this ML, d-devel@l.d.o.
reminds me that I took me a long time before subscribing here.
(And it is unlikely that I will soon join the javascript packaging ML)
So it will be a surprise when I meet a member of the class of 2017.
I'm looking forward to it.

Which starts with
  On previous packaging workshops, we had to spent a lot of time
  troubleshooting issues when people used older versions of Ubuntu which
  had older version of dh-make, gem2deb, npm2deb etc. So we thought of
  clearly mentioning the pre requisites so we can use the available time
  more efficiently.
That is soo familiar,
thanks for the text after
  You MUST have a debian unstable system (physical, virtual machine or a container)

Nice achievement.
Respect.
It is up to us, the Debian community, to accept new members, to blend them in.
