I recall this being a misguided attempt to move it out of /dev "because it's
not a device".  The migration did not go well, especially in the face of
chroots that need to have it mounted, and since systemd did not handle this
the same way sysvinit had, we effectively now have a mess in the other
direction.
We should fix it so that everything again treats /dev/shm as the mountpoint.
