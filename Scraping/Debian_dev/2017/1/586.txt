I'm afraid not (even supposing that the lack of the commitid is just a
bug).  For a debian.org service, I would like to be able to check out
the running version without interacting with a proprietary online
service.
Also, what stops (answer might be workflow, technology, whatever) an
operator who is in a hurry directly updating the running copy without
pushing to github ?
As I say, I don't want to impose more work on you because of my outre'
ethical views.  I would like to solve this problem by providing a
patch that causes debiman to copy its source and its git history to
its own output.  That way you would have to do nothing.

Using github as well is up to you.  I won't try to talk you out of it.
But I think for a service in the .debian.org namespace, bugs should be
reportable without interacting with a proprietary web service.
So thank you for agreeing to work with a system you don't find
comfortable.  You'll see that I have filed a bug against b.d.o
requesting the manpages.debian.org pseudopackage.
Ian.
