Ah, got it. Thanks! It would be nice to mention in dgit(1) that
--overwrite is also useful when using dgit for the first time (rather
than just for NMUs).

I still haven't really made up my mind if I want to use git-maint-merge
or git-dpm. Russ recently raised a valid point with the Debian
modifications over-time becoming all tangled up and impossible to
separate. I thought I could solve this with git-debcherry, but that
seems to be more of a technology demo than an actual solution (it's
getting noticebly slow even on a small test tree and is implemented in
330 lines of bash...).
Incidentally, where would you like to see dgit discussions? On the bug
tracker, or on debian-devel? I'm surprised that there is no dgit mailing
list.
Best,
-Nikolaus
