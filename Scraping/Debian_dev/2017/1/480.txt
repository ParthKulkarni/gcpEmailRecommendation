DSA Team already relies on puppet for setting up new machines [1].
Migrating all the configuration to puppet could help DSA's work and would
also enable setting up private/public test instances in an automated way.
The puppet packages seem to be in good shape in Debian and adding
a few more modules could cover most of DSA's needs. I would happily
contribute by packaging a few modules.
Providing a puppet module could be a criterion for accepting new services,
but I'm not part of the DSA team, this is just a suggestion. :-)
Cheers,
