AFAIK, that's only true for projects.
"masters" can't add people to teams, but they can add new members to
single projects.  IMHO, that's fine pretty much everywhere: if you trust
somebody to create a repository, you probably also trust them to allow
somebody else to work on it (and take the right decision about which
level of permission to grant to the new collaborator).
