Which has the potential to make the installer non-distributable or not
freely redistributable the same way as free packages.  Even if the
Debian project obtained the necessary permission/license to
redistributed, it would certainly have restrictions and I suspect it
would not likely be something that would autoatically transfer to other
entities (think users copying/sharing installers or derivative
distributions).
The situation is more complex than your characterization.
