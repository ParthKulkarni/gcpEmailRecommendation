In my eyes, that is just moving the choice to an earlier point in time
when the user might not have enough information to make the decision,
for example because of brand new hardware. But, having two installers
side by side is a very good option, and then also have the non-free
version prompt the user when it detects that non-free firmware is needed
to get a fully operating system. Also, the purely free version could
point to the non-free installer if non-free firmware is required.

I'd avoid emotional words entirely. Just say that non-free firmware is
provided as-is and does not allow modifications to fix bugs or add
functionality, in contrast with the vast majority of the software in
Debian, which does guarantee those properties.

I have no illusions that a competitor to x86 will magically be more free.

I would just keep it neutral and stick to facts.
