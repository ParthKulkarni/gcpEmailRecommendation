Let me ping about https://bugs.debian.org/859649 which is much simpler
than the other CC bug it was (erroneously?) marked a duplicate of
(because the other bug is partly blocked by there being multiple
versions and variants of the CC licenses.).
CC0-1.0 is now used by hundreds of Debian packages and most of the
time it is not listed in the package's debian/copyright!
