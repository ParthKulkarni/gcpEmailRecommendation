It would have been best for him to download the ISO with non-free
firmware embedded, do you know how he made the decision to download
the ISO without non-free firmware?

Sounds like you need to get him to file a bug against ntfs-3g and
against whichever meta-package or other component should be installing
ntfs-3g. For the latter, perhaps gnome-software/PackageKit needs some
sort of filesystem detector that installs relevant packages. I was in
the same position recently with the Apple HFS+ filesystem.

That is a shame, since Linux Mint isn't exactly known for its security
support. I'd strongly suggest he move to Debian with cinnamon and
other Linux Mint apps.
