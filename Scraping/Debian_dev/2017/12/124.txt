Dear Jonas,
Le 05/12/2017 Ã  10:39, Jonas Meurer a Ã©critÂ :
Don't take me wrong. I agree firmware is software. It's just not part of 
the operating system. Therefore, providing these non-free bits on the 
main install media does not contradict article 1 of our social contract: 
"We promise that the Debian system and all its components will be free 
according to these guidelines" and "We will never make the system 
require the use of a non-free component".
"We will be guided by the needs of our users and the free software 
community. We will place their interests first in our priorities. We 
will support the needs of our users for operation in many different 
kinds of computing environments. We will not object to non-free works 
that are intended to be used on Debian systems, or attempt to charge a 
fee to people who create or use such works. We will allow others to 
create distributions containing both the Debian system and other works, 
without any fee from us. In furtherance of these goals, we will provide 
an integrated system of high-quality materials with no legal 
restrictions that would prevent such uses of the system. "
  - we have promised to be guided by the needs of our users. Our users 
(including in the free software community) need those non-free 
third-party blobs.
  - we have promised to not object to the use of those non-free works 
on Debian systems.
While I agree we need to promote a better world with the availability of 
more free components, our social contract entitles us to provide the 
means for our users to run Debian on their brand new system, even if 
this requires non-free, third party tools.
What I'm saying is that we should not consider the "non-free" disk as 
"unofficial". It should be as official as the free one. It just happens 
to contain additional, third-party components, for the sake of our 
users. And if the medium-with-third-party-components is official, no 
need for the one without them. Just don't install those components by 
default and we have the best of both worlds.
Regard, Thibaut.
