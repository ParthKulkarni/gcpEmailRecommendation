I couldn't agree more.
You all know the big amount of combinations we have:
suite - arch - ISO size/flavour - freeness
suite: stable , testing, whatever
arch: amd64, i386, arm, mips, whatever
size/flavour: DVD, CD-ROM, USB, netinst, whatever
freeness: including or not non-free, whatever
There doesn't seem to be a single page to find all these links.
And that should be easy to fix by anyone with the time, knowledge and
the will to do so.
