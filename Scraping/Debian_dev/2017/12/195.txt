Users who are facing this kind of limitations will most likely remove
/usr/share/common-licenses, /usr/share/doc and /usr/share/man and maybe
more already. I don't think that it makes any difference to them if we
install 5 or 50 text files into /usr/share/common-licenses and the
benefit for package maintainers is far greater.

I believe most people would be happy if we included this version. [1]

Someone set up a wiki page: https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses
We could just build upon this content and complete the work by linking
to accepted packages in main that are using those DFSG licenses.
Shall I file another bug report against the Debian Policy or can we
reuse one of the existing bug reports for this matter?
