+1.  I'd love some guidance on this.  I'm not convinced that our current
Policy approach is best here.
Although I'm not convinced that we want to put *every* DFSG-free license
there, since there are a lot of licenses only used by single packages, and
I'm not sure it's a good idea to have 80 copies of the Expat license with
all of its wording variants.
Please note that I'm pretty sure I can speak for the Policy maintainers as
a group in saying that no way are we taking on the responsibility for
determining what licenses are DFSG-free or not, so we'll need some source
of information for what licenses are eligible for inclusion from someone
else (probably ftpmaster, maybe via NEW processing).
