Considering this thread, it's easy to understand: a list of copyright
holders, so one wont spend hours writing such a list in
debian/copyright, which is built only based on the assumptions that all
copyright holders claiming to be one have at least written their names
in upstream source code files. But it looks like the issue is deeper
than this, and is probably a Debian problem, not an upstream OpenStack,
so I don't dare to ask again. I'm totally on your side with what you
wrote below (ie: the Apache license doesn't require listing copyright
holders).

The issue is: Debian FTP masters do not agree with these "comments from
legal counsel". Or rather, they just reject packages, saying that this
or that copyright holder isn't listed in debian/copyright. I also
strongly feel like it's pointless, but this happened to me *many* times.
Since we get no explanation, or anyone from the FTP master team entering
this thread, it's pointless to even discuss this here, unfortunately... :(
