I wish you good luck with that. I attempted *twice* to have the
copyright holder information attached to each upstream project on
upstream OpenStack, and twice this was a failure. Maybe I'm not good
with communication, but I don' think it's the bigger factor. I just
think upstream doesn't care, they (wrongly) think that licensing is
enough, when clearly, it's not for Debian (we also care the copyright
holding part).
