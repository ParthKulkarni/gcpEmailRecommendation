We (the Debian Project) can't tell anyone what to spend their time on. We 
can't even tell our own volunteers. The only people we damage with 
unreasonable requirements are ourselves and our users.

Surely not. Whoever contributes to a project does so under the same 
license terms as the project unless otherwise noted. Gathering a complete 
list of copyright holders is ridiculous busywork, since the result is (1) 
incomplete (do you crawl the entire VCS history or are you just scanning 
the tarball?) and (2) untrustworthy.
I fully agree with Steve Langasek:

Sometimes the license requires listing the copyright holders. In those 
cases, the list of holders must be present in the copyright file. In the 
rest, there is no need to list them. Only the license matters.
.oO( should the copyright file be renamed to license to avoid this
     eternal discussion? )
