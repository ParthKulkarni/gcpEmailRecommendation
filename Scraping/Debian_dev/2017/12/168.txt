It would, indeed, be nice to get a rationale for summarizing a file-by-file 
list of copyrights.
I re-read that 2016 thread just now and it seems to me that most of the 
discussion centres around summarizing the LICENSE(s) of the resulting work.  I 
agree that knowing the license of a package is useful.  Having 55000 copyright 
lines is not.
Perhaps we should deprecate debian/copyright and just create debian/license 
instead!

It's telling to me that there was *no* answer to your question in the 2016 
thread.  I have only been around Debian for 20 years.  Maybe someone with a 
longer history can recall the reasoning behind the copyright file?
