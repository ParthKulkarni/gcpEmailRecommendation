I learned that transfering projects is not working as I thought. Only the owner 
can transfer them.
Could you (or any other DD) create these projects in the group Debin for me and 
make me "master" of these?
epstool, corebird, gimagereader, gstreamermm-1.0, gtkspellmm, gtranscribe, 
qtpass, rawtherapee, subtitleeditor
Or should I open an issue at https://salsa.debian.org/salsa/support ?
Thanks,
Philip
