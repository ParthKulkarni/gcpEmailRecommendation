That's your opinion, but nothing that's near consensus - according to
this discussion thread. For what it's worth, I don't agree on your
opinion. For me, non-free firmware still is software, and we should not
advertise it more than it's needed. There's valid usecases of debian
*without* non-free firmware, so there's no need to ship it by *default*.
I agree though, that (unfortunately) most desktop users might need
non-free firmware. So we should make installer images with non-free
firmware available and easily accessible. And the thread shows that
there's plenty room for improvement on that.
