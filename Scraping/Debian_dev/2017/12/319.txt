  Description     : Simple log monitoring utility for the systemd journal
journalwatch regularily checks the systemd journal and reports all entries above
a given priority via email.  The tool supports a regexp-based per-service
whitelist.  It is similiar to tools like logwatch or logcheck, except it's much
more KISS and only works with the systemd journal.  In particular, since it can
take the message priority into account, it needs much less of a whitelist.
I want to package this tool because I am going to use it on my servers, and I
think it may be useful for others as well.  I am looking for a sponsor.
