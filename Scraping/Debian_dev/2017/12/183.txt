OK, but surely it is up to Debian to choose the form of such information.  For 
instance: each binary package is unambiguously linked to a source package; 
said source package is easy to locate and contains the complete copyright 
holder information.
In the medical device industry, regulators allow vendors to use the "least 
burdensome" means of complying with a given regulation.  At the risk of 
sounding naive, why can't apply this principle to copyright?
