  Description     : helper commands to create and install new Drupal projects
When setting up a new Drupal project with
drupal-composer/drupal-project, drush and drupal-console are not
available yet and some repetitive tasks can use a nicer command line
interface.
These scripts are especially useful when setting up projects in user web
directories[1].

Some more info about the upstream project is available at
https://ao2.it/en/blog/2017/08/02/drupal-init-tools-quick-and-easy-drupal-8-setup
Since Drupal 8 is not available in Debian I think that having
drupal-init-tools in the official archive can make it easier for users
to set up a Drupal site on their machine.
I am the upstream author of drupal-init-tool and I plan on maintaining
the Debian package myself, but I am not a Debian Developer or a Debian
Maintainer.
I do have a sponsor who is kind enough to upload some other packages of
mine, but if someone is interested in web stuff and want to sponsor me
for this one, my usual sponsor and I would surely appreciate it. :)
Thanks,
   Antonio
