I got the impression that the idea of having two installers for download,
side to side, received least hate of what was proposed.
Having no purely free installer, or having it play second fiddle to the
non-free one, would sacrifice too much of our principles in my opinion.
Yet having such a "tainted" installer to its right/bottom would also
satisfy the need of users with bad hardware.
Would this be acceptable to you without employing all the hassle of a GR?
