there's also the (already mentioned) use case where one network adapter
(e.g. the wired one) will work fine, but you need non-free firmware for
another adapter (wifi).
while this will successfully bootstrap the system to a point where the
user can launch a browser and duckduckgo why their wifi is not working
(as long as they stay wired) and eventually fix it, i think it is still
a kind of "bummer" experience for a *new* user, likely to turn them away.
which might turn the questions into something like:
 [] stay free (no wifi)
 [] enable all network devices (install non-free software)
(these are only meant to replace your suggestion in specific situtations)
