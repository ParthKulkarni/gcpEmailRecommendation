4.d also says NOTICE can be distributed in the source form when it is
distributed along the derivative work (which is our case).
Unrelated, but I am developing some kind of "lintian fatigue". People
may find helpful to let Lintian warn about every little thing. Each time
I have to update a package, I have new lintian notices and/or
warnings. Sometimes Lintian is right, sometimes it's not. Most of the
time, this is quite pointless for me.
Related, this d/copyright stuff is also pointless to me (for the same
reasons pointed by zigo).
