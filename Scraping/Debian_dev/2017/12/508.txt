Have a "redirect-url" file in the .git directory of the repository? That
can then be used by the anonscm web configuration to send a proper 301
response to the HTTP client. That way, nobody has to maintain a single
map and individual developers can tell the infrastructure where the new
repository lives.
For bonus points, make this be something that can still be added to
after alioth is shut down/made read-only, so that the
"anonscm.debian.org" permanent name can also be used for repositories
that are newly created on salsa and never lived in alioth to begin with.

It is never too late for a fix of what is a seriously problematic issue.
I'm willing to look into the details of doing this if you're happy with
the proposal.
