If your git tree has only debian/ directory, that is accurate. However,
in case you have the whole upstream tree there, that is misleading. 
Especially if you have delta against upstream. It would be good to
signal casual visitors that this repo has upstream changes that might
be interesting for them.
So I would limit the pkg- prefix for repos that really only carry debian
packaging.
