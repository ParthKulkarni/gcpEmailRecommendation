There are two types of mailing lists, which seem to be mixed up here:
1. discussion lists
2. "maintainer lists" for bug report forwards, upload confirmations etc.
Sometimes, there are separate lists for boths; then usually the
discussion list is on lists.d.o, and the maintainer list is on
alioth. Debian-Science is a prominent example for this.
In this case, the lists.d.o team do does not want to also host the
second list; and here the team tracker may help.
For other teams however (and this is your case), both lists are merged
into one list; and then this list is sometimes on alioth, and sometimes
on lists.d.o. In this case, as far as I understood the lists.d.o-team,
they would agree to move the whole list to lists.d.o. So, you would not
lose any functionality.
