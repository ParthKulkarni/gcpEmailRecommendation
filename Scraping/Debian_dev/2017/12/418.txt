  Description     : library to communicate with Nitrokey stick devices
 library to communicate with Nitrokey Pro and Storage devices in a clean and
 easy manner. Written in C++14, testable with py.test and Catch frameworks,
 with C API, Python access.
 Needed for the newest version of nitrokey-app as well as other Nitrokey
 related software.
 If there is interest, I anticipate setting up a Nitrokey related team and
 maintaining this within that team.
