Are you saying that Boost isn't well-known? I was forced to spend a
few hours doing a thorough copyright file earlier this year for
mozjs52 which is simply the JavaScript engine from Firefox 52 ESR. I
first tried copying the Firefox 52 ESR's copyright file (removing the
extra lines that didn't apply to this more minimal source) but it
wasn't complete enough. (mozjs52 is essential for GNOME Shell 3.26.)
