Dear Sean,
Le 04/12/2017 Ã  21:47, Sean Whitton a Ã©critÂ :
Mostly because we should keep it (or rather make it) as simple as 
possible to install Debian.
I also believe this should be less controversial. I don't see any 
problem with shipping non-free firmware on our main installation media 
as long as they are redistributable, because I don't consider them part 
of the OS. The user has this hardware, to use it she needs the OS to 
upload that third-pary blob to her device, let's allow her to do that 
easily.
Having the two download links side by side on the front page would 
already be a major improvement, but it would still be very confusing for 
our users. That's why I would prefer to put the "beware of the leopard" 
sign inside the install medium, and provide only one medium that would 
work for both kinds of users.
Kind regards, Thibaut.
