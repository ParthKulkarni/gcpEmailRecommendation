  Description     : Java library for receiving SMTP mail
SubEtha SMTP is a Java library which allows your application to receive SMTP mail with a simple, easy-to-understand API.
This component can be used in almost any kind of email processing application. Hypothetical (and not-so hypothetical) uses include:
  * A mailing list manager (see SubEthaMail)
  * A mail server that delivers mail to user inboxes
  * A mail archiver like The Mail Archive
  * An email test harness (see Wiser)
  * An email2fax system
  * SMTPseudo A filtering forwarding server
  * Baton SMTP proxy for one or more backends (rules based on sender/envelope)
  * Mireka - Mail server and SMTP proxy with detailed logging, statistics and built-in, fail-fast filters
Features
  * Supports minimum SMTP specification described in rfc2821 (4.5.1)
  * Supports STARTTLS
  * Supports SMTP AUTH
  * Supports SMTP over SSL/TLS (via specification of server socket factories)
  * Uses builders for concise code and a discoverable API
I plan to maintain it within the pkg-java team. I do not require a sponsor.
