Thanks for the hint. I intended to make a similar proposal to change
Debian Policy 12.5 in such a way that
License: [GPL-2+]
would be sufficient with copyright format 1.0 for referencing the full
license text in /usr/share/common-licenses.
Using
|License: GPL-2+
| On Debian systems the full text of the GPL-2 can be found in
| /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2
also appears redundant to me.
I have also started to file bug reports against debian-policy and
requested to add more DFSG-licenses to /usr/share/common-licenses. For
this purpose I updated https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses already but
there is still room for improvement. @all Please help with updating this
page in case a DFSG-license is missing.
Regards,
Markus
