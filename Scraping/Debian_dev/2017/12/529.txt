There is another important difference: masters can add new team
members. Which means that we actually loose any control on the team
members if we grant "master" to all. For collab-maint, since all DDs are
masters there, anyone can actually decide to grant "master" to any
non-DD on the base of *personal* trust (right?).

For collab-maint, I think this is a problem: we actually want to get
people into collab-maint, and so the threshold to do so should be as low
as possible. If, as a non-DD, I first have to request the repository
creation from someone else, I even may decide to create the repository
in my personal space instead. From my pre-DD experiences I remember,
that it is quite boring to need to wait for others on every step, and I
personally would just skip those steps which are not needed to complete
my package.
For specialized teams (f.e. Debian Astro, and maybe Debian Science), I
however don't think this is a problem: There is usually someone who
anyway observes the ITPs for packages that may fit (f.e. I do that for
Astro; Andreas is known to answer on potential Science packages). Then
one could also just offer to create the repository.
Best regards
