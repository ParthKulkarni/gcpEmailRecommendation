Thank you very much for your work. It is very much appreciated.

Also note that currently the permissions set up for the debian group 
allow debian developers to create projects but not delete or transfer 
them. When experimenting it's better to do so in you own namespace.

Note that setting up a runner is fairly easy, so if you have spare 
resources firing up a gitlab-ci-runner and hooking it into your projects 
is straightforward.
It would be awesome if someone could somehow integrate autopkgtest with 
the CI runners, especially if that can be done via the autodevops feature.

For those not following planet, Christoph Berg published a handy import
