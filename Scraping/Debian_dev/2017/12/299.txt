People keep thinking this, and in a very strict and limited sense it's
sort of true, but it's not usefully true.  While Debian ourselves always
at least arguably has source alongside binaries (we have images without
the source, but the source is available from the same site), the project
has always allowed downstream distributors of binary-only images, and our
binary images (like netinst USB sticks) are intended to be widely
redistributable without worrying about loading source onto the same image.
It would be highly surprising, and rather rude, to those distributors if
suddenly their work was in violation of licenses because we stopped
complying with licenses unless source was distributed alongside.
(They obviously have to provide an offer of source or point to our
available source if they don't include source, due to all of the GPL code
we have, but that's much easier.)

I am one of those people -- I find it insanely useful, rely on it heavily,
and would be extremely upset if it ever went away.

Turn down the thresholds?
