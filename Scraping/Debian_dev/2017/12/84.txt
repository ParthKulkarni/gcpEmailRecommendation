Are you sure?
I've been managing Windows 7 at my workplace for years now, and I've
never seen this "suspend in response to Shut Down" behavior there; the
first place I ever saw it was on a Windows 8 machine.
I'm not sure I've yet seen it in our current Windows 10 pilot, either,
but I also haven't looked especially closely there.
