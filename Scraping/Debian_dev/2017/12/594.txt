  Description     : Lightweight state manager for responsive websites
 Simple State Manager is a JavaScript state manager for responsive websites. It
 is built to be lightweight, has no dependencies, and aims to be easy to use.

 As a state manager, SSM allows you to target different JavaScript towards
 different states of a website. It allows you to define as many states as your
 site requires and provides independent Enter, Leave and Resize events for each
 of the states.
