In my experience the "specific effort" is exactly the reason for only 
*semi*-automated scraping.

How do you propose we "point to it" in a way that ensures we are in fact 
pointing to the legal statements - i.e. not missing some of them (which 
might be further down in the code) and not bogusly pointing to code 
lacking some or all of the needed legal statements?
If it is "not worth [your] time" to cover _all_ sources for the project 
you are maintaining then perhaps you should team up with someone who 
does find it worthwhile to do that part of the packaging maintenance - 
because that part of the packaging maintenance is not optional in 
Debian!
