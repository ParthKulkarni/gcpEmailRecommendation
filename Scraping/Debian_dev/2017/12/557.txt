  Description     : Really simple WSGI way to serve static content
This library provides an easy way to include static content in 
your WSGI applications. There is a convenience method for serving
files located via pkg_resources. There are also facilities for 
serving mixed (static and dynamic) content using “magic” file 
handlers. Python builtin string substitution, kid and Genshi 
template support are provided and it is easy to roll your own 
handlers. Note that this distribution does not require kid or 
Genshi unless you want to use that type of template. Also provides 
a command of the same name as a convenience when you just want to 
share a little content over HTTP, ad hoc.
It is a dependency for dj-static, which is already in Debian.
