What others say is true. It's not easy to find the download link, even
for me as DD.
But this is something that we have already detected: our main website
needs work.
We just need someone doing the work.

I don't really know, I would say gnome.
We would have to check every desktop stack and review how things are
for both NTFS and HFS+.
BTW filling bugs is ideal, but is something a new user [to linux
ecosystem] won't do (or unlikely).
I'm worried about this topic, I would love to lower the barrier for new users.
You can read related blog post I've written before about this [0][1].
The main website, www.debian.org, is the first point of contact for many people.
Identify the right download is hard, even if the information is well
organized, see for example the ubuntu page [2].
Other thing is the branding topic. I would like to promote usage of
Debian testing for standard desktop/laptop users in personal
environments (not for business machines)
but the 'testing' word scares people. I don't have a valid candidate :-(
But we should really point to stable to specific users rather than all
by default.
