Ignore the renamed repositories: if somebody renamed them then they 
obviously expected to have to update the VCS URLs anyway.
Switch the anonscm name when alioth will be shut down: the people who 
have already migrated can keep pushing to the old repository as well to 
keep it in sync.
This is not perfect, but it is still better than having to update 
countless packages.

I do not think that it is our fault to find out just now that a major 
feature of alioth would be broken.
