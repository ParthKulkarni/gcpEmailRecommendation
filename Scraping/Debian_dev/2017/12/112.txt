Like the following?
  <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/debian-installer/>
Which is 3-click away from the main page:
  Release Info => <https://www.debian.org/releases/>
   stable => <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/>
    2nd sentence => <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/debian-installer/>
Or do you prefer another pointer in our official documentation?
  <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch06s04.html.en>
OK, you need to dig deeper to find this, 4-click away from the main
page:
  Installation manual => <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual>
   Installation Guide for 64-bit PC (amd64) => <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/>
    2.2. Devices Requiring Firmware => <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch02s02.html.en>
     [4th sentence]
     However, this does not mean that such hardware cannot be used
     during an installation. Starting with Debian GNU/Linux 5.0,
     debian-installer supports loading firmware files or packages
     containing firmware from a removable medium, such as a USB
     stick. See Section 6.4, “Loading Missing Firmware” for detailed
     information on how to load firmware files or packages during the
     installation. 
      6.4.1. Preparing a medium => <https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch06s04.html.en>
      [6th sentence]
      Official CD images do not include non-free firmware. The most
      common method to load such firmware is from some removable medium
      such as a USB stick. Alternatively, unofficial CD builds
      containing non-free firmware can be found at
      http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/.
However, given that no one reads the documentation today, but it relies
on search engines, the first result in DuckDuckGo (and FWIW in Google as
well) for "Debian Firmware" gives...
  <https://wiki.debian.org/Firmware>
...where the 3rd paragraph contains (copying it here for search
engines):
  Firmware during the installation
  In some cases the installer detects the need for non-free firmware and
  prompts the user to make the firmware available to the installer to
  complete the installation. This can happen, for example, with wireless
  network cards which often require non-free firmware to function (see
  ipw2200 for an example).
  A suggestion, especially while installation on hardware unfamiliar to
  you, is to download the firmware archive for your platform and unpack
  it into a directory named firmware in the root of a removable storage
  device (USB/CD drive). When the installer starts, it will
  automatically find the firmware files in the directory on the
  removable storage and, if needed, install the firmware for your
  hardware. You can find firmware downloads for your Debian version at
  http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/.
  In some cases, firmware supplied on removable media may not be
  detected automatically (e.g. 740503). In these situations, drop to the
  console and manually mount (see mount(8)) your removable storage on a
  temporary directory (e.g. /media).
  Alternatively, you can use one of the parallel installer image builds
  that also include all the non-free firmware packages directly. We have
  "netinst" CD images and also DVD installer images - see
  http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/
Thx, bye,
