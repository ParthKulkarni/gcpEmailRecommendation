  Description     : Open Source SIIT and NAT64 Translator for Linux
SIIT mangles packets, simply replacing IPv4 headers and IPv6 headers.
Stateful NAT64 will enable you to run multiple IPv6 client nodes behind 
a few IPv4 addresses.
Jool is an Open Source implementation of IPv4/IPv6 Translation on Linux
which aims to be fully rfc-compliant, building a bridge between IPv4-only 
and IPv6-only networking nodes. I consists of two kernel modules and 
a set of corresponding userspace tools.
See http://jool.mx/en/intro-jool.html#compliance for details.

Relevance, Maintenance, License
-------------------------------
Jool is one of the newer implementations for SIIT/NAT64 and has a
small, but active user community (see https://github.com/NICMx/Jool). 
It was funded by NIC Mexico and co-developed with ITESM. 
I use it in several networks and it seems to be a viable solution 
to provide IPv4 connectivity to IPv6-only networks. Depending 
on the client device you can use NAT4/DNS64 odr 464XLAT and therefore
have a smooth transition from IPv4-only to IPv6-only networking.
There is some dkms support available in the source package, 
but it clearly needs some love, since e.g. quite old versions 
of the debian helper tools are used and the userspace code is 
currently not packaged at all. 
I am currently discussing details with the upstream authors, 
including the current license situation. Jool is currently 
licensed unter GPLv3+, leading to an incompatibility with 
the linux lernel GPL2 (only). Upstream is currently discussing 
a license change for that matter, so it might take some time 
before we can actually start uploading packages.
Since this will be my first debian package, I'd like to start 
maintaining the package with the help of a sponsor.
