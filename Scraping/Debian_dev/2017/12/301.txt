I already often open or reply to bugs in lintian (including when I think
severity is wrong). The main problem is not when lintian is wrong, the
main problem if when lintian is right but is nit-picking. While I
understand some of us would like to reach perfection, it is tiresome to
fix every small issue, notably when they don't have any other effect
than making a tool happy (and a few people) happy. And I never run
lintian at pedantic level.
I think we may loose contributors by trying to be perfect.
As an example, the spelling errors are useful for debian/ directory (as
informational), but totally useless for upstream stuff. For me, they are
not worth telling upstream, they are not worth adding to an override
(which could become outdated and give you another lintian warning).
I have just updated a team-maintained package and I get:
W: python-pyasn1: spelling-error-in-description-synopsis Python Python (duplicate word) Python
W: python3-pyasn1: spelling-error-in-description-synopsis Python Python (duplicate word) Python
Description: ASN.1 library for Python (Python 2 module)
Description: ASN.1 library for Python (Python 3 module)
Is that a bug? Dunno. I suppose someone with good intentions added that
and now, I have either to open a bug report for lintian, add an
override, fix the duplication or just ignore that hoping it will
eventually go away. I see a discussion already happened about that:
 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=822504
 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=844166
Being perfect was a fine goal when we had 10k packages. We have too many
of them now and we _have_ to maintain them because there are many
dependencies to package for a single package of interest.
We could afford to be perfect again in the future when we will accept
anybody can fix those kind of problems without bothering the
maintainer. People thinking this is important to fix those kind of
problems can just do it themselves.
Currently, the situation is that a few people can push their "agenda"
(replace by a weaker word) to many people by pushing more stuff into
Lintian (or in discussions in d-project or d-devel to "improve"
packaging). And I know that you are open to both sides (I was able to
make you revert a change, don't remember exactly which).
