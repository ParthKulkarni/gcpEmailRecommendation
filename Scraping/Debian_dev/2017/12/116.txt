Sorry, I was not replying at the "non-free firmware" part, but to
debacle's suggestion of having a "beautiful ISO download page"
(underlined above to be sure we are talking about the same thing).

What was not clear in my words?  IMHO you should document yourself
*before* trying something, and I am not even considering firmware at
all.  Or, if you prefer, you should not assume that everything works out
of the box (in any field, thus not IT-restricted).
And, FWIW, when d-i tells you that you need a firmware for network
(Wi-Fi or not) to work, the installation process has not started yet,
which means that if the computer you are installing Debian into is the
only one you have the previous OS is still there.  Thus my tests for
search engine results for "Debian Firmware".
Thx, bye,
