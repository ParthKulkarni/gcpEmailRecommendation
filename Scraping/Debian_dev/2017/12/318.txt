luajit ; it has one, and maybe it is enough. But I wondered in case I
need to add some other debug flags or want to instrument it (which I
know, I'll do some day for some other package ) or just, simply, fix it
and try it with the initial package.

That's a useful hack I may use, right. Maybe limited though :-/
Thanks Emilio. At least, I know, I'm not missing some feature :)
