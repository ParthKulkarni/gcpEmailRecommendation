Uncontroversial suggestion:
List the fully free ISO first, have it coloured green, blue etc., and
the ISO with non-free firmware second, coloured red, yellow, orange or
purple.
Slightly controversial suggestion:
Write, after the explanation of why we think the non-free ISO is bad,
    "if this is your first time installing Debian, and you're not sure
    which image to pick, choose the image that contains non-free
    firmware."
It is clear that we believe that the non-free firmware ISO is more
useful to beginners.  This is controversial because it might seem like
promoting non-free software.  But I think it's mitigated because it
follows an explanation for why we think it's bad.
