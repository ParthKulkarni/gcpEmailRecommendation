This seems sensible in 2017, and we have indeed had this perspective
confirmed by someone who works with low disc space systems.  It would be
good to have a few more confirmations, though.

Please use a separate bug for each license or set of licenses to be
added.  This is because there are sometimes license-specific
complexities (see #795402 for example).
Please try to re-use existing bugs, such as #795402.  Otherwise we just
have to spend time merging them.
