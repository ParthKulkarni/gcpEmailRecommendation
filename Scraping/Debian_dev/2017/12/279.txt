I suspect you are setting an impossibly high bar for determining the 
license of a work. We can (and do) rely on upstream telling us the truth 
when they say the work is of a certain license, and that contributions 
from third parties have been accepted under that license.
If what you say were true, no non-trivial piece of software would be 
distributable. Is your copyright credited on all the packages where you 
have submitted patches? There's plenty of software in the archive where 
there is uncredited copyright, and that is not a problem because the 
contribution was made under a given license.
