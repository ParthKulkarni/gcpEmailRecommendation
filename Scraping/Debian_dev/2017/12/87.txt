Quoting Paul Wise <pabs@debian.org>:
Every time I need a Debian ISO, it takes me minutes to find it.
I didn't even know, that there were an ISO with non-free firmware.
There should be a beautiful ISO download page, e.g.
https://www.debian.org/download[s]/
with all architectures and supported releases, similar to
https://www.ubuntu.com/download
or
https://linuxmint.com/download.php
Who likes to the hero of the day? :~)
Cheers
