Is there a policy here? I'm seeing a mix of formats rather than any
consistency. For example for keyring-maint should we request
debian-keyring as a group, or just use keyring-team? DSA and ftp-master
have gone for the latter (dsa-team + ftp-team) but I'd assumed the
former was more appropriate for an official Debian entity.
Likewise for pkg-electronics I was expecting pkg-electronics-team (to
match, e.g., pkg-suricata-team) but I see things like libvirt-team as
well so the pkg- prefix doesn't seem to be consistently used/unused.
Guidance appreciated. I don't want to make an effort to move over and
update URLs etc only to have to do so a second time because the team
name wasn't of the correct format.
