That is one interpretation of what I wrote.  
However: what I intended to convey is my perception that there was an 
unannounced shift of policy -- or a shift in interpretation-of-policy.  Being 
unannounced, I have no direct evidence for such a shift, of course.  So all I 
can present is that it was accepted for a long time and then suddenly not 
accepted.
