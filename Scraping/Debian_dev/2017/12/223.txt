  Description     : A configurable daemon to suspend a system in case of inactivity
Autosuspend is a configurable daemon to suspend a system in case of
inactivity. Its main usage scenario are home servers like NAS systems or
media centers that should be sleeping if they are not needed.
Autosuspend provides a set of configurable checks that determine whether
the system is currently active or not. These checks do not depend on
Xorg (though one check supports querying X idle time).
There are a lot of different scripts roaming around the internet for
this purpose but none of them is really generic and as flexible as
autosuspend. Moreover, they have not been packaged. Autosuspend tries to
collect the various efforts to provide such a system in a
well-maintained daemon that is ready for use.
I am the author of the software and plan to provide package updates
whenever necessary. I hope that by providing this software as a package
in Debian more users can easily make use of it and don't need to fight
with outdated scripts found somewhere on the internet. Ultimately, this
hopefully reduces unnecessary energy consumption.
I have already drafted the required Debian packaging infrastructure,
which is available here:
https://github.com/languitar/autosuspend-debian. A first request for a
review regarding this on the IRC channels was positive and proposed to
open the ITP.
