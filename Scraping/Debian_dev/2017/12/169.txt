My personal thoughts:
Debian/copyright file can help maintainers figure out the license status of 
*each* files to check DFSG status more easily, and that's all. The copyright 
holder does not really matter: listing contributors really should be the job 
of *upstream*.
We must admit that d/copyright is useful: writing this file can help figure 
out the source and license to each file and discover non-dfsg files / vendored 
libraries included secretly by upstream (which happens from time to time). 
That should be helpful to ftp master's task of processing NEW queue and 
examining each file's license.
Howerver, what we, the distribution maintainers, really care is that these 
files do not conflict with our guideline aka DFSG. In this situation it is the 
license that matters, not copyright holders. For large software like linux 
kernel or libboost, we don't really need to take hours trying to make a 
comprehensive author list in d/copyright file. Something like
"2010-2017 (C) The Boost Maintainers" should be acceptable. Of course if the 
file is under a different license (different from th license of whole project) 
or some authors had their names written inside source code *explicitly*(e.g., 
in the comment), it must be listed out in a separate paragraph of d/copyright.
