Hi,
thanks for your work, salsa is really great!
Is it true (and intended) that -guest users can't create projects within
teams/groups they are member of? Or am I missing something? [I was not able to
create a project within the Debian Science Team]

For me this is a drawback. I'm a DM and maintain 9 packages within
collab-maint now. I want to invite other Debian Contributors to help with my
packages. Now I'd need to ask some DD to create 9 projects for my existing
packages (and also for new ones) within the Debian group for me. On Alioth I
could do this on my own. Why the difference?
I know I can just create the projects within my namespace but I'd loose the idea
of "hey feel free to contribute to my packages". That's really sad.
  
Best,
Philip
