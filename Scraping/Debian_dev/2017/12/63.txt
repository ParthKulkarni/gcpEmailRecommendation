On our website, we don't promote hardware, just people/companies that
you can pay to install Debian for you:
https://www.debian.org/distrib/pre-installed
On our wiki, there are numerous install howto pages but we don't
separate those by non-free firmware requirement, just by vendor.

In our install manual at least:

We can definitely do better here, especially after promoting h-node in
a press release:

mafm posted about his work on the RISC-V architecture port a while

We can definitely do better here and I think it is feasible to do
both, as mentioned in my other mail.
> Are *you* using non-free firmware?
Unfortunately yes, all of the devices I've acquired in recent history
have required firmware from Debian non-free and also had embedded
non-free firmware. Multiple devices even ran Linux and most of those
were GPL-violating, one even violated the BSD license for some of the
userland.

Personally, I think the values written down in the SC/DFSG are not
where we are going wrong, but our execution of them could use some
work.
