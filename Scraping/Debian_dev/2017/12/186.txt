Because that file is typically a record of a specific effort to
*acquire* that information, and to document it for people who are
careful about the provenance and grant of license in the work.
The upstream source typically does not have that property, which is why
I'm saying ‘debian/copyright’ is valuable for that in a way that can't
be had from a typical upstream source work.

In my experience the information can be had from the upstream people, in
many cases where it simply isn't recorded reliably or coherently in the
source work.
The distinction I'm drawing is in response to proposals in this thread,
to declare the record in ‘debian/copyright’ to be obsolete. Some
proposals have advocated that we rely on finding that information solely
in the upstream work.
I'm pointing out that's comparatively unreliable, by comparison to the
current – admittedly under-resourced – concerted effort to find and
gather and standardise and maintain that information for the benefit of
people who want to quickly find the freedoms granted and who
specifically grants those freedoms.

I agree that the burden falls unfairly on Debian Project volunteers. I
prefer to have our volunteers push that responsibility upstream more
often, making it a norm beyond our project and into the broader
community, to expect that the information can be found. And gently,
diplomatically, promoting the importance to any potential free software
recipient of knowing the provenance of a work's copyright status and
provenance.

I agree with the need to be clear about why. I hope this and other
expressions in this thread have helped make it clearer.
As you describe, the Debian Project has a long history in the free
software community of leading by persistent example, on a basis of
well-reasoned principle and informed by fact. I think this can continue.
