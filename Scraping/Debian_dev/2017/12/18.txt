FWIW, almost all the non-free firmware packaged in Debian is freely
redistributable.  The only exceptions I know are in the firmware-
ipw2x00 and firmware-ivtv packages, which have 'clickwrap' EULAs.
firmware-ivtv will never be needed at installation time, and firmware-
ipw2x00 is for wifi chips that haven't been sold for around 10 years,
so I think it would be reasonable to leave it out.
Ben.
