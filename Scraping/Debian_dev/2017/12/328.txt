I was referring to problems with libssl1.1, that, according to a post
by you Art (I think) is fixed. However, having the same version number
with different code causes more work, for which I don't have the time
atm. This is why the email was a request for help (RFH).

Actually the problem is I run very low on time right now. Let me make
two things clear, I really like citadel despite not using it and
upstream (all of them, not just Art) is very nice to work with and more
than willing to help.
My problem is a very simple lack of time. I'm able to do an upload
every now and then, but not much else. However, since you said there'll
be a release shortly, I won't ask for removal if that release fixes the
RCs.
