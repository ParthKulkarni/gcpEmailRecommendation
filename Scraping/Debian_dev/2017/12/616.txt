Hello
Debian is moving away from Gnome2::VFS [1] . This obsolete module will be 
removed from next release of Debian.
Unfortunately, shutter, a very nice Gtk2 screenshot application,  depends on 
Gnome::VFS, which means that shutter will be removed from Debian unless this 
dependency is removed from shutter [2].
I guess that the options are:
* port shutter from Gnome2::VFS to GVFS or GIO 
* replace Gnome2::VFS with other Perl modules.
Unfortunately, Debian perl team do not have the skills or bandwidth to work on 
this port, I hope that someone will be able to help.
If you're interested in taking over maintenance of shutter, please:
- coordinate with upstream shutter team [3] (yes, upstream is on launchpad)
- keep debian-perl team and me posted
All the best
Dod, on behalf of Debian Perl team
