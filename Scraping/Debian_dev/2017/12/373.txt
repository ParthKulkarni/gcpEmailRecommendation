  Description     : parse and normalise street addresses around the world
libpostal is a C library for parsing/normalizing street addresses around
the world using statistical NLP and open data. The goal of this project
is to understand location-based strings in every language, everywhere.
libpostal's international address parser uses machine learning
(Conditional Random Fields) and is trained on over 1 billion addresses
in every inhabited country on Earth. It uses use OpenStreetMap and
OpenAddresses as sources of structured addresses, and the OpenCage
address format templates to construct the training data, supplementing
with containing polygons, and generating sub-building components like
apartment/floor numbers and PO boxes.
