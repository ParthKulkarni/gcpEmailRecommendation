Debian is also about providing an Universal Operating System, and I
have seen BIG installations of Debian on server farms moving to PragBF
because the Broadcom network chips on those servers required people
jumping through hoops while PragBF just works.
We're actively driving _real_ users, those that also shell out money
to sponsor Debian, away from Debian with those steps.
