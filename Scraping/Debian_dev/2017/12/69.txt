Well articulated. 
But this is more of an website problem. We already have installers with
non-free firmwares, we just hide them under "unofficial[1]"
We have a conflict between "We don't hide problems" and the FSF "don't
recommend non-free software". The FSF stand is that we recommend nonfree
software already - by having links to non-free software in our web and
wiki[2]. So we might as well add proper links to the non-free software
in the installer CD page.
