I suspect you read more into my words than I (intended to) put there.
I did not imply that we need to hunt down and get physical documentation 
attesting copyright.
By "tracking" I merely meant that we should keep track of which parts of 
the source code correlates with which (upstream claims of) copyright and 
(only their) licensing grants.  Or that in case of relaxing (e.g. 
assuming a copyright holder from metadata like commit messages) then we 
should document in what way we are arguably "inventing facts".

I disagree - but maybe because I don't understand your logic.  Care to 
elaborate (sorry, I didn't get your meaning from below questions)?

Not explicitly in the header of all (substantial) patches that I have 
authored, no.  I am not perfect, but I try.
I do believe that others examining my packaging work can sensibly assume 
from my copyright claims of packaging files in general, that 
(substantial) patches authored by me is copyright me with same license 
as the packaging in general.  If they cannot safely assume that, then 
they will need to get in touch with me to verify - just as I will have 
to do with our upstreams.
Was your point in asking that question something else?

Care to provide some examples?
I strongly believe you mistaken: Code licensed but without a copyright 
holder is not really licensed.
