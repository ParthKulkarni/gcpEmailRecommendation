No. Since debtags are imported into Packages/Sources, it shouldn't be
hard to do the same as debtags for other Packages/Sources fields too.
I would guess it would also be possible to use values from packages for
most of them and then add overrides that would be used until the value
from the package changes.
For watch files there was the sepwatch alioth project, but that is no
longer used since watch file processing was moved to udd.

The same approach could be used for other fields, a git repository
containing the overrides, which is imported by ftp-master and merged
into the package information, which is then exported to the archive.
