Following with your example (pkg-suricata-team) I prefer to make it
explicit for people outside debian that this is about packaging.
So I usually put the 'pkg' string also in individual repos, i.e.:
pkg-suricata-team/pkg-suricata.git
I had problems in the past with misleading repo names, and it cost
nothing to have the pkg string everywhere and be explicit.
Newcomers usually like this as well, things are not obvious for them.
