The debian/copyright isn't valuable as input to the ftpmaster review, it's
treated as the /object/ of the review and the ftp team imposes an artificial
requirement, not grounded in either Debian Policy or the requirements of our
licenses, that debian/copyright align with their analysis of the copyright
of the source package in order to clear the NEW queue.
So the ftp NEW process is auditing the wrong things, for the wrong reasons.
The purpose of debian/copyright is not to duplicate the copyright and
license information already included in the upstream sources; it's to
provide the relevant information to users who only have the binary package.

Yes; and the way to fix this is to correct this misconception (rooted in the
historical policy error to specify copyright as a source-level file) that
debian/copyright *should* document the source copyright instead of the
binary copyright.
