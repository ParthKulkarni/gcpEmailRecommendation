I just found a few packages under Apache 2.0 that didn't distribute the
NOTICE file.  It turned out that the same information was in
debian/copyright, but that may not be the case in the future.
I'll file a wishlist bug against Lintian to check for a NOTICE file in
packages that say they're under Apache 2.0 and warn if it's not included
in the binary package.
