I'm certainly fine to put work into this for those who want to use it, but
I never boot any existing OS before installing Debian, and I'm sure I'm
not alone.  It's extremely useful to be able to install Debian on bare
metal (or a newly-replaced factory hard drive) or on a system whose
existing OS install is hopelessly broken.
We should also help people find easier-to-use non-free install images with
the required firmware to be able to bootstrap networking.  The firmware
sideloading mechanism is inherently arcane and complex, even for
experienced Debian developers.  I don't think asking people to use an
existing OS install is a sufficient alternative.
I'm of course 100% in favor of clearly labeling those images as
undesirable and pointing out the problems with them, but the current state
of the market (even apart from the acknowledgement that a lot of our users
do not regularly buy new computers at full price) makes non-free firmware
the only available choice for a lot of people.
