One caveat: be careful of licenses that include clauses like:
    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
or:
    Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
    documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,
    provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that
    both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
    supporting documentation
or:
    1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
       notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
In chose cases, the list of copyright holders may well be part of the
"above copyright notice" and hence must be included in the binary package
somewhere.  (Also note that this means the copyright notice provided by
upstream, even if it's wrong, which is an interesting wrinkle.)
Admittedly, it's highly unlikely anyone would pursue legal action over
this, but still, our goal around licenses has generally been to fully
comply with the license, even the bits people probably don't care about.
