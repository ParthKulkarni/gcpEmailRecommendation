As Anton noted, you need to be a "master" in that group.  The difference
between "master" and "developer" in groups is only that masters can
create projects.

It's not different.  Also on alioth you weren't supposed to be able to
create repositories. https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00008.html
But apparently that wasn't really enforced as wild cronjobs keep
overriding the one that restore the inted permissions as written there.
So yes, you need to get a DD to do the one-off work of creating a
"collab-maint" project and grant you "master" powers in that projects
(so that you can add future members yourself).  Now, is that really so
burdersome?
