  Description     : small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite
lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol
suite that has been developed by Adam Dunkels at the Computer and
Networks Architectures (CNA) lab at the Swedish Institute of Computer
Science (SICS).
The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce the RAM usage
while still having a full scale TCP. This making lwIP suitable for use
in embedded systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for
around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.
It can be used as a maintained user-land TCP/IP stack.
