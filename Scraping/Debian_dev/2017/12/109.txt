How about https://works-on-pcs.debian.org?  :-)
Personally, as a developer, I will say there is one benefit of being
so user-unfriendly that the usable ISO is hidden under the
beware-of-leopard sign, which is that it serves as a "you have to be
this technically aware to install debian" barrier.  As a result, we
don't have the low signal-to-noise bug reports that are all-too-common
on Ubuntu's launchpad.net.
So if we want to reform our "FSF-ly correct freedom is more important
than being friendly to novices" (and it's not clear Debian as a whole
agrees with this sentiment), folks might want to consider that this
probably means we will need to have more people doing bug triage.
Personally, I think prioritizing users who just want to a working
PC/Laptop over the FSF is the right choice, since I belong to the
pragmatic wing of the Open Source movement, but I suspect I'm in the
minority in the Debian community.  Which is fine; I'll just continue
to enjoy the high quality of most bug reports in the Debian BTS.  :-)
