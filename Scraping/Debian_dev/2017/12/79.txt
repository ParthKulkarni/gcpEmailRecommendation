Yes, but... this is an issue often brought up and discussed since I am
aware of, that is, for over 15 years. It's _hard_ work to properly
structure a web site as information-rich as ours, with as many
different user types as its targets. Even more, with moving targets,
as Web design styles rise and fade continuously.
And I am _not_ implying that not enough work has been done; the Debian
website has vastly improved since I know it. But properly organizing
it is something... VERY hard to get right.

I think GNOME is a safe bet, as it is the "most defaultest" of all
desktops (even given "there is no default" â˜º)

This is something that does not seem to draw consensus. I am of the
opposite camp. Regular users should have stable, as they don't want
huge updates or regularly broken systems, missing pieces and so on. A
regular user should be fine with upgrading their desktop every two
years, if anything! I mean... Look over the fence. How long did it
take for Windows XP to disappear? Before that, how long was Windows 98
king? How many users still cling to Windows 7? They don't need the
newest, shiniest software. They want something stable that works, and
that _they know_ how to make work. The same should be valid for most
users over here.
