It's certainly better than listing system calls individually, so it would
be useful!
I think whether this or systemd's groupings are more useful depends
somewhat on the use case.  At a quick glance, I think I would more often
prefer systemd's approach to OpenBSD's (the groupings seem more useful),
but there are a few places where I could see it going the other way, and
there are places where OpenBSD is usefully more granular.
