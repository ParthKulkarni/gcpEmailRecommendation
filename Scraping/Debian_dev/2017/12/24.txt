As I wrote to you privately (why did you send 2 separate emails?), this
last paragraph shows we agree: we both want the ISO including these bad
firmwares to be reachable, as long as we very much insist on the fact
that it's an unfortunate non-free workaround for bad hardware vendors,
and that we prefer the version not including these. So let's not argue
more! :)
Cheers,
