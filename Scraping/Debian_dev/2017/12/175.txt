It is also invaluable, from what I can tell, as a common reference point
between what the *actual* copyright information of the work is –
something that can only be inferred, and that can change as the work
changes – versus what the maintainer *has inferred* as the copyright
information of the work.
Without that, it's very hard to talk about differences between what the
maintainer thinks is the case, versus what information is actually in
the upstream work.

Agreed. Though I don't know of a better way, today, to serve the
purposes described above.

Thanks for expressing this succinctly, Ian.
