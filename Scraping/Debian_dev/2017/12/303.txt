This is the sort of thing that makes me feel like you have your Lintian
settings turned up too high for the amount of nit-picking that you want.
The spelling tags that apply to upstream files are
spelling-error-in-manpage and spelling-error-in-binary, which are
informational only.  These are intentionally not shown by default to avoid
warning fatigue.  The assumption is that someone who turns them on is
seeking out a pickier set of warnings.
For the record, my upstreams have always been quite happy to take patches
that fix small spelling errors like that, and they're often a trivial
GitHub pull request that upstream can merge in five minutes, but I totally
understand why people might not want to bother.  Hence informational.
