What about offering them side to side?  It looks like a non-negligible part
of posters in this thread want the purely free version -- and, indeed they
represent the Social Contract and the original purpose of Debian and Free
Software in general.
I'd also put a _succint_ description of what's wrong with them.  Written in
a way that avoids philosophical distinctions which are opaque to those who
don't already know about the matter -- but emotional imprecise words are
okay.

To a fully rational person who wants a purely free system -- no harm, as
the increased download size is such a small portion that shaving it is not
worth the extra user confusion.  But, offering only a non-free version would
be a big step in a direction many of us do not want.  And, there's hope that
in ten years x86 might lose its dominance, in which case we'd rue falling
into this slippery slope.
Thus: I'd say we should prominently offer two downloads, one with a
paragraph of insults.
Meow!
