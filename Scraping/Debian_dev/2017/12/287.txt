I understand.  I'm not saying your frustrations are unreasonable.  They aren't.
As much as people find writing debian/copyright, imagine the pain associated with checking it.  Personally, I don't want it to be any harder than it has to be.  I'm currently canvasing other members of the FTP Team to understand what everyone thinks is correct.  This isn't the ideal time of year to do it, so I make no promises on schedule, but I do hope to be able to have a coordinated response to the points brought up in this thread.
