That description doesn't match my experience.  Nor does it match what the 
Policy Manual requests: "Every package must be accompanied by a verbatim copy 
of its copyright information and distribution license".
I have a very hard time believing that debian/copyright "typically" contains 
anything other than a scraping of upstream source files.  I take the existence 
of various tools to semi-automate this task as evidence in support of my 
thesis.

I'm advocating it because in practice that's what is happening -- it is a 
"verbatim copy of ... copyright information".  However, it's not worth my time 
to collate that from 55000 files.   The source package has the verbatim copy 
already ... we just need to point to it!

Your email sounds like a personal preference of yours -- which is fine.  But 
it does not explain why Debian should demand it.  On the contrary: your 
expectation goes way beyond Policy's "verbatim copy".
