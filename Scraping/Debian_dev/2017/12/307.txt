As I have said previously, the problem also appears with warnings. I
would never dare running Lintian in pedantic mode.
Lintian is full of opinions. For example, I often get:
W: python-pysnmp4-doc: extra-license-file usr/share/doc/python-pysnmp4-doc/html/_sources/license.txt
I can add a "rm" or an override. Then, one day, the file will become
license.rst.txt and I have to update that. Each time, I have to build
the package, notice the warning, make a change, build again. Small time
loss, huge demotivation (when I tell people what I do as a Debian
packager, nobody seems to be impressed by that), totally useless warning
(this file doesn't harm anybody). Maybe there is a bug open about that,
maybe I could open one and dive into an endless debate about how a bad
maintainer I am to not want to remove extra files?
Each time, more warnings appear. Just today, I get:
W: python3-pysnmp4: python-package-depends-on-package-from-other-python-variant (Suggests: python-pysnmp4-doc)
My solution? Removing the Sugggests and pray someone doesn't open a bug
to request suggesting the documentation.
We also now have:
W: python-pysmi: new-package-should-not-package-python2-module
This is the translation of a group of people's opinion.
On the copyright subject, I got a reject about a NEW package because I
didn't list all copyright holders. I understand the matter is not
settled as more time is needed to collect opinions, but this is also a
huge demotivation factor. I won't upload a fixed version until someone
else is interested by the package.
