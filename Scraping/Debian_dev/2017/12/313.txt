Description: library for converting fonts to WOFF 2.0
 woff2 is a library for converting fonts from the TTF format to the WOFF 2.0
 format. The library also allows decompression from Woff 2.0 to TTF.
 .
 The WOFF 2.0 format uses the Brotli compression algorithm to compress fonts
 suitable for use in CSS @font-face rules. WOFF 2.0 is a W3C Candidate
 Recommendation.
Other Info
--------------
This library is required by webkit2gtk 2.20 which will be released in
March. Previously, the library was bundled in the webkit2gtk sources.
(It's still bundled in Chromium, Firefox, Thunderbird, TeX Live).
I am packaging this as part of the Debian Fonts Team.
Packaging is at
