I fully agree with the above, and also strongly feel like we must get
the FTP masters point of view.
See Jeremy Stanley's post in this thread, and you'll understand that
upstream OpenStack, for example, do not agree at all with the view of
FTP masters that we need to list copyright holders. If such a copyright
holder list isn't required by upstream (with even advice from its legal
council), why have I wasted so much time? If I'm spending so much time
on this, I at least would like to understand that it's fully legally
required and/or what are the FTP master team motivations.
