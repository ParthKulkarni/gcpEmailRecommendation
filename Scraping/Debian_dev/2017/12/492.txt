The Debian Med team has currently 874 packages and I have spent a lot of
time to migrate everything from SVN to Git and to fix all the Vcs
fields.  It would be pretty boring to do another upload of >800 packages
to fix VCS fields again (more or less every three years to something
else).
Kind regards
