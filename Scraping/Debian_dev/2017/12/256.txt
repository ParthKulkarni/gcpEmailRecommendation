  Description     : Extended DBus interface for Qt
 Qtdbusextended library provides several additional features to the original
 QDbusAbstractInterface class, includes:
 - Handling of PropertiesChanged signal in DBus Properties Interface
 - the GetAll method in DBus Properties Interface
 - asynchronous alternative to original synchronous QtDBus properties mechanism
 - an alternative cache mechanism for Qt DBus traffic
This library is the build-dependency to several Deepin [1] softwares. Instead
of bundling them, we decided to package and maintain it inside Debian pkg-deepin
group [2].
Upstream Nemo Mobile hasn't seen activities in this project recently but still
keeps it maintained. Staff from Deepin Tech. are also willing to fork it [3] and
continue maintenance of the library were there any bugs found in it.
Regards,
Boyuan Yang
