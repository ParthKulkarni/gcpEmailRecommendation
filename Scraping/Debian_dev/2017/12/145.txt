I have no opinion about win32-loader since I've never used it and would
never use it (I don't even have any family members who would use it or be
able to use it), so I'm really unqualified to comment.  What you describe
sounds great for people starting from a Windows system.  That's just not a
problem I've had in about 20 years.
I don't want work on win32-loader to *replace* making download of a
working network install USB image easier, since that's the change that
would help me and those I know the most.  I'm very happy if we can do
both!
