Personally, as a member of the FTP Team (Assistant, not Master), I'm reluctant 
to participate in discussions like this unless I'm highly confident that I 
understand the team policy on such matters completely enough to speak totally 
correctly on the matter because I anticipate that regardless of any 
disclaimers I might put on any inputs they will be taken as, more or less, 
stating the team's position on the issue.
I'm going to violate this rule slightly and say I don't think the issue is as 
simple as some people make it out to be.
I intend to work within the FTP Team to get some clarification on the team's 
position on this, but I don't expect it to be quick.  I agree we could do with 
better documentation of what the policy is and why.
Marc, I don't want you to take this as me beating up on you, because that's 
not my intent, but I find your tone frustrating.  The FTP Team is not a closed 
cabal.  There are regular calls for volunteers (there is a new set of FTP 
Trainees learning about the job right now), so anyone who's willing and able 
to do the work is welcome to help.  I find demands on my time from those who 
aren't frustrating.
