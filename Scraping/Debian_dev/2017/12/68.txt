Yes. We're approaching a worst-of-both-worlds scenario: We're not Free
enough to have the FSF recommend us, and we're not non-free enough for
our OS to run on current hardware used by Linux beginners, and cause
them to end up with OSses that are (a) not Debian, and (b) even less
Free than Debian.
It's the same story we had five years ago when our release cycle
changed.
