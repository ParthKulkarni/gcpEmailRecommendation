Hi,
Is there a good reason not to have a source package build binary packages with
different versions in the following circumstance?
The prerex source package (sources obtained from CTAN) provides a LaTeX package
for drawing charts. It also contains two tarballs: one with the sources for the
prerex utility (a readline interface for creating these charts) and one with the
sources for the vprerex (a Qt utility for doing the same). There are three
different versions at play (the outer LaTeX package's, prerex's, and vprerex's)
and vprerex/prerex are not released simultaneously/at the same time.
Until now, both the prerex and vprerex binary packages have used the source
package's version. I would like to make each use the versions of their
respective tarballs so as to better track upstream development.
I've checked the policy (section 3.2[0]) and found no guidance, and I've
discovered that android-sdk-meta does something similar[1]. My hesitance stems
from suspecting that an implicit assumption in lots of our infrastructure is
that binary packages and their source packages have the same version.
Happy holidays,
Ryan
