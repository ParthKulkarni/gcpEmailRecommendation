If you aren't interested in package polishing, it sounds like it would
be best for you to use the lintian profile that only reports
reject-level or error-level complaints. Possibly run lintian in
pedantic mode once per release cycle per package.

For me and others the right answer to spelling errors is to send a
patch upstream, usually they are happy to apply it.

As a human reading a description, I think I would prefer these:
Description: ASN.1 library for Python 2
Description: ASN.1 library for Python 3
The number is the only part of the brackets that seems useful there.
