I understand what you say and it does make sense, but I'm sorry to say
that I think this ultimately makes matters worse.  When we have a
situation with no-one from the ftp team is willing to say anything in
public without a formal settled internal consensus, the result is (in
the nature of human institutions) nearly no output at all.
And of course in that situation everyone on the outside is reduced to
kremlinology.  _Of course_ such kremlinology means that every
statement by an ftp team member is examined closely - perhaps more
closely than it can bear.
The solution is not to clam up even further; it is to relax and make
more individual contributions.  So:

Thank you very much for violating your rule and please would you - and
other ftp team members - violate it some more :-).

Thanks.
Ian.
(Disclosure: I'm one of the ftp trainees mentioned.  I have not really
done any ftp review work yet because it's December, so please don't
think I have much inside insight.)
