  Description     : display available keybindings in popup
`which-key' is a minor mode for Emacs that displays the key bindings
following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a
popup. For example, after enabling the minor mode if you enter C-x
and wait for the default of 1 second the minibuffer will expand with
all of the available key bindings that follow C-x (or as many as
space allows given your settings). This includes prefixes like C-x 8
which are shown in a different face.
