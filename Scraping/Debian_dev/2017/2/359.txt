Sure.  I think it's a hard classification question and I'm not fully
comfortable with any of the answers given.  For my own packages, I've
tried to stomp these bugs out entirely so that I don't have to worry about
whether they're RC or not (but was aided by the fact that I've mostly run
into them in cases where I'm also upstream, and as upstream I have a
committment to ensuring the test suite works on any platform on which it's
reasonable to install the software itself).  I've not run into any really
hard ones yet, though.
