This is sounding a lot like ModemManager, which has recurring problems
with the inability to distinguish between modems and non-modem
serial-attached devices (especially since both will often use a commodity
USB/serial converter with generic device IDs, like a FTDI or PL2303 device)
without probing them by sending AT commands that could be interpreted in
unintended ways by non-modems (like Braille devices, embedded devices'
serial consoles, and Bastien's JTAG adapter).
/lib/udev/??-mm-*.rules are probably of interest. ModemManager
implements a whitelist (devices that are definitely modems), a blacklist
(devices that are definitely not modems), and a greylist (devices that
might be modems, but will only be probed by ModemManager if the user
explicitly requests it via some GUI or CLI frontend).
