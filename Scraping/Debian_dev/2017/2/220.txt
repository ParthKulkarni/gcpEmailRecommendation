  Description     : package desktop applications as AppImages that run on common Linux-based distributions
Using AppImageKit you can package desktop applications as AppImages
that run on common Linux-based operating systems, such as RHEL, CentOS,
Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian and derivatives.
The AppImage format is a format for packaging applications in a way
that allows them to run on a variety of different target systems
(base operating systems, distributions) without further modification.

AppImageKit is a concrete implementation of the AppImage format and
provides tools such as appimagetool and appimaged for conveniently
handling AppImages.
appimagetool uses a next-generation AppImage format based on squashfs
and embeds a runtime for it. appimaged is a daemon that handles
registering and unregistering AppImages with the system (e.g., menu
entries, icons, MIME types, binary delta updates, and such).
Flatpak and Snaps solve similar problems. AppImageKit is comparatively a
very simplistic approach.
