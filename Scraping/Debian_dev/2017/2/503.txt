  Description     : status monitoring for trapperkeeper services
 
The Trapperkeeper Status Service is a Trapperkeeper service that provides a
web endpoint for getting status information for a Trapperkeeper-based
application.
Other Trapperkeeper services may register a status callback function with
the Status Service, returning any kind of status information that is relevant
to the consuming service. The Status Service will make this information
available via HTTP, in a consistent, consolidated format. This makes it
possible for users to automate monitoring and other tasks around the system.
This library is a prerequisite for packaging PuppetDB and/or Puppet Server.
