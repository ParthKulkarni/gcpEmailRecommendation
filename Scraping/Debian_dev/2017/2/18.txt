  Description     : firefox extension that blocks ad and simulates clicks on each blocked ad
AdNauseam is a lightweight browser extension that blends software tool and
artware intervention to fight back against tracking by advertising networks.
AdNauseam works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop uBlock-Origin) to silently
simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real
interests. At the same time, AdNauseam serves as a means of amplifying users'
discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk
surveillance agendas.
I thought of "adnauseam" for the source package and "xul-ext-adnauseam" for the
binary package. I intend to package this by taking inspiration from the
ublock-origin package and I'll need a sponsor.
