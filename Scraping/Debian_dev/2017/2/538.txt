  Description     : Abstract classes for persistent connections to remote services
 Classes related to persistent connections to remote services.
 Currently the main service provided by the connections defined here
 is access to some kind of filesystem which is modelled as a simple
 tree structure library, implemented in pure Java. Connection implementations
 are supplied by classes in other packages
The package will be maintained by the Debian Astro team. It is part of
the effort to package the Virtual Observatory Java tools from Starlink.
A git repository will be created at
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-astro/packages/starjava-connect.git
The package depends on the creation of 855781.
Best regards
Ole
