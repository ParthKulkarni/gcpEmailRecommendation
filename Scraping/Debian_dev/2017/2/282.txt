    Description: [DESCRIPTION]
Wheezy amd64 7.9.0 DVD, setup with graphical installer, using Germany as
country, a German keyboard and setup of an encrypted drive: after boot
the complex key for decrypting the drive is not accepted by the
initramfs. The key contains special characters like capital letters and
characters like ~{[| that require a key combination with ALT GR on the
German keyboard. 
Also in the maintenance console, you cannot enter caps or special
characters.  
Crosscheck was done with graphical installer and a simple key that did
not require caps or ALT GR: key is accepted. The complex key worked fine
when using the default CLI installer.
Looks like the graphical installer does not set the correct keymap.  
Hope my description is sufficient.
Best regards, Rolf
