  Description     : priority maps for Clojure
 
data.priority-map implements priority maps in Clojure. A priority map is very
similar to a sorted map with its entries sorted by value rather than by key.
In addition to supporting all the functions a sorted map supports, a priority
map can also be thought of as a queue of [item priority] pairs. To support
usage as a versatile priority queue, priority maps also support the
conj/peek/pop operations.
This library is a prerequisite for packaging PuppetDB and/or Puppet Server.
