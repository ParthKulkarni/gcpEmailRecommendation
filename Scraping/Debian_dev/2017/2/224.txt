  Description     : EmptyEpsilon is a spaceship bridge simulator game
EmptyEpsilon places you in the roles of a spaceship's bridge officers. While
you can play EmptyEpsilon alone or with friends, the best experience involves
6 players working together on each ship.
Each officer fills a unique role: Captain, Helms, Weapons, Relay, Science, and
Engineering. Except for the Captain, each officer operates part of the ship
through a specialized screen. The Captain relies on their trusty crew to report
information and follow orders.
