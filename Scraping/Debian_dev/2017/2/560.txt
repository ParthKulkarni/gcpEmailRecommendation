Hi there.
Apologies in advance if this issue is already addressed somewhere in the 
Debian universe.
Last night it occurred to me that my specific model of laptop, the 
Samsung RF711-so7uk, has some hardware features that could use some 
close attention.
Rather than plead to users, developers, Debian etc. to "do the job 100%" 
I thought a more modest enquiry would be appropriate.
How much of the hardware in your machine is directly supported by 
Debian? As a percentage like "supported/present" I don't know.
If there was a package that displayed it then I could try connecting 
devices to see how that changed and pick the best one.
What then about the "21st century" features: OpenGL, WebGL 1.0/2.0, 
Wayland...?
The Debian version of google-chrome (Chromium) from Jessie supports 
WebGL 1.0 whereas the direct-from-google version (google-chrome Version 
56.0.2924.87 (64-bit)) doesn't support the installed hardware.
 - VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core 
Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)
 - Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless 
Network Adapter (rev 01)
I started using the Ralink/Mediatek usb wifi adapter after the Broadcom 
one had problems.
I realise that as a community-driven project, gauging how much of your 
users hardware is supported is a niche topic.
Could Debian have an install option to be allowed to query the installed 
hardware so it can build a database of hardware configurations Debian is 
installed on, like popcon?
Then you would have metrics: how many machines, how many types of each 
machine, how many instances of each device type, ...
You could then tag a bug report with your configuration hash(es) and 
have a better chance that someone else using the same hardware would be 
able to help.
Possibilities abound!
Regards,
Philip Ashmore
