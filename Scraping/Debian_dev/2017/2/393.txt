Thanks for the reminder that I should probably ask to be removed from
Maintainers for that package.  Martin Pitt has been doing most of the
work, I don't seem to be seeing eye to eye with him lately.[1]]

I didn't say all my tests were reliable.  Did you miss my mention of
the dgit test suite ?  I know quite what it's like to have a heisenbug
in the test suite, in a program which you don't maintain, and whose
upstream denies that there can possibly be any races.[2]
There is no excuse for leaving an unreliable test as an FTBFS.
They're a nuisance for QA folks, trouble for downstreams, and a
landmine for users.
Ian.

[2] Luckily another upstream developer eventually came to the rescue
and now the failure probability is down to about one in 10-20 runs of
dgit's adt tests.
