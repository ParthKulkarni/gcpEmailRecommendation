    Description: A small commandline app written in Go that allows you
to easily create and delete releases of your projects on Github. In
addition it allows you to attach files to those releases. It interacts
with the github releases API. Though it's entirely possibly to do all
these things with cURL, It's not really that user-friendly. For
example, you need to first query the API to find the id of the release
you want, before you can upload an artifact. github-release takes care
of those little details.
