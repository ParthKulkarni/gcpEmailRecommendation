I realize you've already done so, but for future reference, this is
ridiculously easy for anyone who's a Debian Developer or otherwise has
an account on alioth:
ssh to git.debian.org, and run:
mkdir -p public_git/repo.git
cd public_git/repo.git
git init --bare
log out again; then, in your local repository, run:
git remote add --mirror debian git.debian.org:public_git/repo.git
git push debian
you're done.
Alternatively, if you don't want to push all branches, drop the --mirror
part on the 'git remote add' thing, and add a branch to every "git push
debian" command. This works for all remotes btw, not just the alioth
ones.
Personally, I tend to push my code to multiple git hosting services,
because it's so simple to do.
