Right, ntpdate for some reason doesn't set the flag to do this.

sysvinit I believe used to always persist the clock to the hardware clock
during shutdown.  systemd doesn't do that, for reasons that I've not
thought about in any depth.  So that's a change, which is understandably
surprising.
If you get in the habit of using ntpd instead of ntpdate to do the
one-time clock syncs, that might fix the problem (alas, I forget the set
of command line flags that do the same thing as ntpdate).
