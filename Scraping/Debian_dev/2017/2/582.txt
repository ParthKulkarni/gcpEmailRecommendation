I'm not sure I have parsed your reply correctly, so let me repeat back
what I think you are saying:
  Since online updates to non-Debian-packaged extensions are disabled,
  it is necessary to prevent installation or use of
  non-Debian-packaged extensions at all: otherwise, users would be
  running extensions without security updates.
Well, the reasoning is sound, but this does not seem like a desirable
situation.
Can we not make the updates work for non-Debian-packaged extensions,
while disabling them for Debian-packaged ones ?
If we did that then there would no need to disable people's
extensions.
(Of course a user should not be invited to install extensions from an
upstream or third-party extension repository, unless that repository
contains only free software, or the user has enabled Debian contrib -
but I think that's a separate question.)
Ian.
