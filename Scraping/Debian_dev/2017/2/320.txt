If you know for sure that any of the bugs above happen because of me
not using enough RAM, you are welcome to prove it.
(in the nnnnnn@bugs.debian.org address, please).
But if you talk about number of CPUs or CPU speed, that's a completely
different issue.
Building a package is like following an algorithm. It may take less or
more time, but it always has to finish. For this reason, "your CPU is
too slow to build my package" is always a very poor excuse, and I hope
you are not trying to set a minimum CPU speed to build packages.
Thanks.
