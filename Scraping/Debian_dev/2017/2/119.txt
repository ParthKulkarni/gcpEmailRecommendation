  Description     : a time-like tool which does multiple runs
Unix's time utility is a simple and often effective way of measuring
how long a command takes to run ("wall time"). Unfortunately, running
a command once can give misleading timings: the process may create a
cache on its first execution, running faster subsequently; other
processes may cause the command to be starved of CPU or IO time;
etc. It is common to see people run time several times and take
whichever values they feel most comfortable with. Inevitably, this
causes problems.
multitime is, in essence, a simple extension to time which runs a
command multiple times and prints the timing means, standard
deviations, mins, medians, and maxes having done so. This can give a
much better understanding of the command's performance.
