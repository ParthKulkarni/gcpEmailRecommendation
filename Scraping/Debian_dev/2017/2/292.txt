I've been trying to do this since 2011, and never fully succeeded. Maybe
someone will have better luck with Canonical that I did.

The relationship has been a way more complicated than what you're
writing. I don't really feel like going back on the history of every
single release (no point, really...), though for some, I wrote all the
packaging of the OpenStack dependencies, in some others, we've worked
them together very well, at least on the python module packaging.
Never they wanted to merge server packages. Even at the last Barcelona
summit, I suggested to Canonical guys to maintain Swift with Ondrej,
which is doing an amazing job. It didn't feel like they wanted to go ahead.
Right now, Caonical team refuses to work on the packaging CI which I
pushed in OpenStack infra, for reasons they may want to explain
themselves (I don't feel like repeating wrongly, but basically, I've
been told it was a duplicate of their workflow).
