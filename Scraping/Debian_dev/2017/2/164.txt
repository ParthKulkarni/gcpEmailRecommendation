  Description     : NFC stack for NCI based NFC Controllers by NXP
This library provides an abstracted interface to NFC controllers in order 
to build applications that make use of nfc technology.
Description to be revised!
This library is provided by NFC to facilitate development of nfc enabled applications.
It currently has support for the pn7120 and pn7150 chips.
SolidRun Ltd is releasing a mikroBUS nfc board featuring the pn7120.
The purpose of this package is to facilitate rapid development of applications utilizing this nfc module, by making it as easy as possible to use from Debian, or a debian-based rootfs.
However this library can be used with devices and nfc addon boards by other vendors providing they feature a supported nfc chip.
Such it could benefit a much broader audience than just SR customers.
I volunteer to do the necessary packaging work, and handle any unexpected build failures in the future.
I would like for this package to be maintained in a packaging team, however I have not been able to identify a single team that would fit perfectly. Is there a team that focuses on IoT, connectivity or low-level hardware development?
And since I am not affiliated with Debian, I am also looking for a sponsor to take on this package.
