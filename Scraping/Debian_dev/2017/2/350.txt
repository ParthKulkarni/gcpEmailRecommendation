/me looks lovingly at the PowerPC G4 Mac Mini propping up his display. I
wonder if I should consider registering as a porter...
How uncommon are single CPU virtual machines? Or containers with resource
constraints to one CPU or something similar? I think that is at least as
relevant as the availability of (new) uniprocessor hardware.
None of the FTBFS problems I've seen in this thread have been because the
tests *required* multiple cores, by the way; more so that they were racy
or buggy in some other fashion. If uniprocessor buildds are finding these
bugs then that's a virtue, IMHO.
