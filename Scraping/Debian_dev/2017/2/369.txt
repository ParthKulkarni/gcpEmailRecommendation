On a related note: Having some way to declare minimum requirements for
e.g. disk space and memory (a la "base GB usage + GB usage/core") used
would be great.
  Especially if it is available in metadata, so wanna-build can see
whether it makes sense to assign a given package to a given build-node.
That way we could presumably fix most of the "resource
exhausted"-failures by not over-committing resources on the buildds.
