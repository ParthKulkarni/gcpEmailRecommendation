You are somehow trying to equate RC-ness with "it FTBFS in buildd.debian.org".
While that may be close to the truth, it is not the truth itself.
And the couterexample has been provided by yourself: Bugs about tzdata
and lsb-base were declared RC by a Release Manager well before they
were removed from buildds (thanks to Lucas Nussbaum).
Does this mean we were doing an "academic exercise"?
No, we were following the common rules that we have set for ourselves
regarding build-essential and build-depends, and those rules do not
(and should not) depend on a particular build daemon failing or not.
Thanks.
