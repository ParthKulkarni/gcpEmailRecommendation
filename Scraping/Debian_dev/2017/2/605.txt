Hi John,
thank you for coming forward with your problem, but I think a better approach
for resolving your issue is to bring it up on IRC, or use the the debian-user
mailing list to further debug the issue. Then, if your problem is not solved,
but further narrowed down, you can provide better infos and file the bug
against the respective package.
The IRC channel is #debian on irc.oftc.net, and the mailing list you can find
at https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/. See you there!
Greetings,
Lee
