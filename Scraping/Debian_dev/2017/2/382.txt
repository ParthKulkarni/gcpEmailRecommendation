So here's my data, from multiple rebuilds since Sep 2014:
https://angband.pl/tmp/builds.sql.xz
(Postgres, but it should be easy to edit the schema for any SQL dialect)
It's all from one machine, running the same kernel line (3.8 vendor for
Odroid-U2), on the same filesystem (btrfs noatime,compress=lzo,ssd), sameish
sbuild settings (eatmydata; regularly upgraded with unstable though).
The data is not ideal -- I run multiple sbuild instances which with only 2GB
memory notoriously ends in swappeathons, thus a package's build time is
affected by what was running concurrently.
Obviously you want only records with status='successful'; I haven't removed
failures in case someone is interested -- for example, there's a bunch of
FTBFSes I haven't yet investigated/filed.
Note that the disk space data is misleading -- sbuild notes only the final
size of the build dir after finished build, peak size may differ.  For
example, ceph ENOSPCes with 51GB free despite sbuild saying only 21GB.

Packages being built in parallel are not a problem -- neither overlayfs nor
btrfs support sharing pages yet even if they use the same on-disk blocks.
Getting peak usage for a set of processes is a very tricky task, though:
if a process uses 50MB then forks, each copy taking 20MB more, the usage
is 90MB not 140MB.  Processes come and go, executable/library pages are
shared, and so on.
The only tool that _looks_ like it gets it right seems to be cgmemtime, not
packaged in Debian yet and requiring some setup.
Having peak memory data from builds would be awesome.
Meow!
