Time is a limited resource and we need to set our priorities. Having
test suites that work 100% of the time with constrained resources is not
a goal I find worthy of the time I can spend on Debian. Unfortunately,
those bugs are popping up as RC and I have the choice between
downgrading them and appear as a bad player or fix them.
