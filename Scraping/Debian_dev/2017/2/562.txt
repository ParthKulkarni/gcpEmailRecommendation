Dear Mehdi,
I'd like to propose OCF.tw to be a Trusted Organization.
And OCF.tw also have the interests to be in. But I don't know how to start.
We've both read
https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL/TrustedOrganizationCriteria
OCF.tw strongly meets the criteria.
Do we need to send some paper to continue?
Yours Sincerely,
Paul
