  Description     : security guides and conformity checks using SCAP
standard​
SCAP-security-guide works with the OpenSCAP tool, which is already
packaged in Debian.
It builds those binary packages:
 ssg-applications - SCAP Guides and benchmarks targeting applications such as
 ssg-base   - SCAP Security guide base content and documentation
 ssg-debfamilly - SCAP Guides and benchmarks targeting all deb-based
 ssg-debian - SCAP Guides and benchmarks targeting Debian 8
 ssg-otheros - SCAP Guides and benchmarks targeting other GNU/Linux
To access further information about this package, please visit the following
URL:

Alternatively, one can download the package with dget using this command:
  dget -x https://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/scap-security-guide
/scap-security-guide_0.1.31-9.dsc
The goal of this package is to deploy SCAP XCCDF Benchmarks and Guides
for various targets not deployed by the OpenSCAP core package, but
supported by the SCAP-security-guide community in which I work as
contributor for Ubuntu, Debian and ANSSI best practices.
Using these guides/benchmarks, it is possible to validate conformity of
Debian-based deployment against standard security policies such as ANSSI
Best-practices, PCI-DSS, NIST SP-800... and to launch remediation
scripts when needed. Using the OpenSCAP ecosystem, it is possible to
manage the security policy of a complete infrastructure, when launching
OpenSCAP tool with the above benchmarks through ssh (for e.g.) or on VM
or docker templates.
