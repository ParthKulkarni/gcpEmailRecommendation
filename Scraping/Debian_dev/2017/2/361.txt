We don't really know. Some FTBFS-randomly bugs *are* that way indeed:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=838828
In that one, unless you cheat with the random seed, the probability of
failure is mathematically guaranteed.

I agree that not all FTBFS bugs are RC, but I reject the idea that we
can take buildd.debian.org as the only and single criteria to decide
about RC-ness as some people seem to do.
This will make bugs not RC "because my computer is too slow" or
"because my computer is too fast" or "because my computer is already
running the kernel of stretch", or "because I didn't installed this
package which is no longer essential", none of which I consider
acceptable reasons to downgrade a FTBFS bug.
Thanks.
