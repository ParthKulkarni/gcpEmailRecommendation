  Description     : C library to control placement in a hierarchy
Binary package names: libcrush, libcrush-devel
 libcrush maps an object signature to a list of devices on which to
 store the object. It is implemented as a pseudo-random, deterministic
 function obeying user specified placement constraints such as: the
 object must be stored on devices that are on two different machines.
The library existed for more than ten years as part of ceph[1]. It is however generaly useful,
for other storage software or other contexts in which data placement should be controlled.
