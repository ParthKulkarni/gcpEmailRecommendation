Hello.
The following packages FTBFS for me randomly. First column is the bug
number, second column is the estimated probability of failure in my
build environment, which is described here:
https://people.debian.org/~sanvila/my-building-environment.txt
Before I ask the Release Managers that they make the bugs at the top
of this list serious again (using some kind of threshold, as discussed
in Bug #844264), I would appreciate if somebody else could double check
that those packages have indeed very flaky tests (or buggy Makefiles,
in some cases).
[ Please report any findings to the nnnnnn@bugs.debian.org address ].
While I agree that none of those individual bugs is more important
than a bug of "FTBFS-always" type, some packages have a failure ratio
so high that if we accepted that they "build from source" with such a
high failure rate, they would effectively honor policy if we had it
reversed, as in "packages must *not* build from source". I call this
"the FTBFS-randomly Schr√∂dinger paradox".
This is, however, not an invitation for the Release Managers to set
50% of failure rate as the threshold, that would be probably the worst
possible interpretation of "Packages must build from source" (which is
already Release Policy).
The current list:
837067  1.000   libsecret
848063  0.990   ri-li
850282  0.820   influxdb (this one is already serious, thanks Adrian)

850414  0.110   ruby-ftw
832865  0.100   telepathy-python
[ The remaining packages that FTBFS randomly for me do so less than
  10% of the time, but in either case all the figures are approximate ]
Thanks.
