  Description     : library for mapping Clojure data structures to SQL
 
honeysql allows building SQL queries programmatically, even at runtime, without
having to bash strings together. Queries are built as Clojure maps, which
in turn are converted into clojure.java.jdbc parameterized SQL.
honeysql also provides a number of helper functions to further help create
queries.
This library is a prerequisite for packaging PuppetDB and/or Puppet Server.
