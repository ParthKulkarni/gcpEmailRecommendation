These packages were rejected and their description is given below.
1. node-pretty-bytes:

"unfortunately I have to reject your package. Examples should not
be placed in the synopsis.
Please have a look at paragraph 3.4 of the Debian policy[1] and
improve the wording of the synopsis and the long description in
your debian/control. Please also pay attention to footnote 9 of
that chapter[2].
While you are at it, chapter 5.6.13 might be of interest as well.

git repo was recreated, so no reference for the rejected description.
It just had this code in addition to current description,
const isGeneratorFn = require('is-generator-fn');
isGeneratorFn(function * () {});
//=> true
isGeneratorFn(function () {});
//=> false
