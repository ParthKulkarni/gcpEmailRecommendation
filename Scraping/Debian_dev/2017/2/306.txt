Correct, I've been told the server would be decommitionned. In fact, I'm
surprised it is still up-and-running. I've explained that some people
could well still be using it, but it didn't seem someone cared.
FYI, I made a backup on my own laptop, but I don't plan on investing a
dime on setting-up an online service myself.

Since the end of 2016, I'm not a Mirantis employee, so I can't talk for
them. I can only guess that it is very unlikely any announcement would
be made. I'd very much welcome someone external from the company to
express discontent to the Mirantis marketing team about discontinuation
of this service. So be my guest...
Cheers,
