Package: general
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
i installed a completely fresh debian 64 bit with kde as desktop environment.
nearly everythink worked fine, but sometimes the poweroff/shutdown does not. To
be exact, if i run as root poweroff -h, it works without porblems, but if i
want to shutdown via the kde-menu or the acpi control (in settings adjusted ofc
via gui), it doesn't do anything. neither does the pc shut down nor do i get
the 30s wait logo.
during now i only saw this after the pc was on for more then 20 mins. if i
start it and try to shut down, i didnt see this problem until now.
so i think it has something to do with the kde control of the buttons in the
menu (the big blue K at the bottom left) depending what a command they call and
the acpi control mybe uses the same command.
to answer complete, log off or restart didnt work, too...the same behaviour:
nothing.
if you have more questions, i would be happy to help, if i can.
