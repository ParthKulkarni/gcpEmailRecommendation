Cannot deny I somehow like that approach.

We still could make this a buster release goal but stretch-ignore some
packages; at least those with a failure rate below five percent.

Wasntme, and I doubt this is a good idea. And although nobody likes the
bringer of bad news, I'm glad people like you build-test the Debian
archive in a setup that is a bit off mainstream but not completely
unrealistic. While this means asking for trouble I consider it a good
idea to identify corner cases while they are in the corner.
