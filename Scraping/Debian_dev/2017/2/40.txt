If using git-buildpackage there's also a "gbp create-remote-repo"
defaulting to colab maint to ease repo setup. To get the above you would
use a config like:
[remote-config alioth] 
remote-url-pattern = ssh://git.debian.org/~/public_html/%(pkg)s.git
in your ~/.gbp.conf and from there on just:
  gbp create-remote-repo --remote-config=alioth
from you any packaging dir to create a remote repo there and push things
initially.
