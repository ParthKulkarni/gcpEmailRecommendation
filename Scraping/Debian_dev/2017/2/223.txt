  Description     : C++ game engine coded on top of SFML from scratch
SeriousProton is a game engine library. It includes a multiplayer server
and game engine largely targeted at two dimensional space combat.
Programmers can use it in their games to simulate 2D space combat, for
example as if it is laying out through a radar view.
SeriousProton is a dependency of empty-epsilon, which is a spaceship
bridge simulation game.
