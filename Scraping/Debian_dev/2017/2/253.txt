Well, tools can be configured, too.  If my UNRELEASED version proposal
is adopted, we could easily let you have a DEB_ENABLE_FOOTGUN variable
that will let you become confused about what binaries and sources are
what, by reusing version numbers from ad-hoc test builds.

Does that mean that if you tested ~UNRELEASED, and it passed all your
tests, you would be unhappy to strip the ~UNRELEASED from the version
and upload it ?
I often do that.  My tools make it very hard for me to mess this up by
uploading anything whose source tree (besides the changelog and
therefore besides the version number) differs to what I tested.
(Of course in principle there might be situations where version
X~UNRELEASED would be treated differently to X.  If that's likely to
be going on then I would have to, regrettably, use the actual
for-release version number for your ad-hoc tests.)

Well, I guess you'd be satisfied with an option to disable this
behaviour.
But: it seems that intend to make commits whose debian/changelog has a
trailer line, a real suite, and a real version, but where the commit
does not contain all the changes ?  I think that's poor practice.
These commits are a liability.  If you push such a commit, and then
later make more changes and do the upload, but forget to to push, a
subsequent upload made from the vcs might lack your changes.
Of course if you really insist you can do this, and probably if the
commits are buried in the history so that no-one every sees them
except when doing archaeology, then there is little chance of your
metadata misleading anyone but you into a mistake.
I don't know how you avoid mistakes.  Perhaps you're just very
careful.
Ian.
