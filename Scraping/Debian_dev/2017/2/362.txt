I find this argument, from a Debian Developer, utterly outrageous.
We are supposed, in Debian, not just to care about what affects us
directly.  We are supposed to be acting in the interests of our users
and our downstreams.
We don't overlook licence problems that have Debian-specific
exceptions.  Neither should we not overlook an RC bug, on the grounds
that it doesn't "directly [affect] the main line of [Debian] package
development."
