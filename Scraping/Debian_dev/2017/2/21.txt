The problem isn't the lack of agreement on git workflow.  The world in
general doesn't have agreement on git workflow, but still manages to
have a fairly-uniform interface to external contributors.  Well, two
"skins" if you will over the same contributors workflow: 1. git clone
something 2. make your changes as git commits that seem to make sense
3(a) git-format-patch && git-send-email or 3(b) git push and press the
"request pull" button in some web UI.
The problems are:
 1. There is^W was (in general, and in practice in many if not most
    cases) nothing you can git clone, to get the source of a Debian
    package.
 2. There is no formal and established mechanism for offering your
    contribution.  (No, sending the output of `git-request-pull' to
    the BTS is not a "formal and established mechanism.)
dgit solves the first problem.  Something like a gitlab.d.o could
solve the second.

I agree and this is why I wrote dgit.  Please try it out.

I agree.

apt-get source's suggestion to use the vcs-git repository is (in
general, and in practice in many if not most cases) a lie.
The vcs-git repository:
 * May be out of date compared to the archive
 * Might contain an arbtrarily weird git tree or git history
 * Usually contains a patches-unapplied tree which is unsuitable
   unless you are a Debian expert (see my posts on this passim)
