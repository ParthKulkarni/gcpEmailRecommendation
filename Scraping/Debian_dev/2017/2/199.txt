If, as you describe, these small, do-nothing packages are not what node
uses when _not_ being run with browserify, but are just stubs
specifically for browserify, than a much better solution would be to
provide one package, browserify-dummy-stubs, have browserify depend on
that, and place all the stubs there.  Since, as Pirate Praveen says,

there is no reason to have a separate Debian package for each of these.
The excuse that the multitude of node packages have different update
cycles, so they should be in separate packages, is a complete
non-sequitur for a bunch of one- or two-line stubs that aren't going to
get any maintenance anyway.
