The main purpose of Polybar is to help users create awesome status bars. It has
built-in functionality to display information about the most commonly used
services, such as:
 * Systray icons
 * Window title
 * Playback controls and status display for MPD using libmpdclient
 * ALSA volume controls
 * Workspace and desktop panel for bspwm and i3
 * Workspace module for EWMH compliant window managers
 * Keyboard layout and indicator status
 * CPU and memory load indicator
 * Battery display
 * Network connection details
 * Backlight level
 * Date and time label
 * Time-based shell script execution
 * Command output tailing
 * User-defined menu tree
 * Inter-process messaging
Users can also develop their own modules and/or integrate modules created by
others.
It can be used a replacement for status bars / panels used in different window
managers and desktop environments.
I plan to maintain this package in collab-maint on alioth
