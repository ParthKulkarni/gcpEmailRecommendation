I don't think so. The number of devices used by lircd is large, and the 
USB ids are not always well-defined...
It might be possible to whitelist "most" devices, leaving it up to users 
of "uncommon" devices to fix it on their own. More work for both package 
maintainers and users, although more safe...
Personally I don't think read access to character devices should be that 
sensitive. The most obvious concern are hardware login dongles. Of 
those, most seems to be mass storage devices; these are *not* covered by 
the udev rule. Neither is yubikey devices.
Also, whatever risks there are we are already taking them when running 
lircd as root.
