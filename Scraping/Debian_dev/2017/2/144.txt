Hi Vincent (and anyone else reading this),

You are like most people under the impression the APT team has a healthy
size and could stay on top of the incoming bugreports and even triage
older onesâ€¦ but unfortunately we are not. The report isn't tagged as
including a patch so another "good" reason to get lost in our pileâ€¦
apt has earned and needs to defend its second place[0] after allâ€¦ :(
It does sound similar to another bugreport I replied to "recently"
(#636871) talking about "Happy Eyeballs" (RFC6555) which seems like the
formalisation of your implementation â€“ and that newcomer offer is still
up for grabs (as all others I have ever made, just sayingâ€¦).
The patch itself looks a bit strange on first look regarding general
style, using environment variables instead of config options and I am
not a gigantic fan of 90% code copies of functions in the same file
(with a name diffing only in naming-stylesâ€¦) â€“ and it of course doesn't
apply cleanly anymore, but if you are still interested in working on
this we can surely work this all out. Just ping the bug with an updated
patch and I will work on a more detailed review.
Thanks in any case for report and initial patch and sorry for not
getting feedback in years from the fellowship of the cow!
Best regards
David Kalnischkies
