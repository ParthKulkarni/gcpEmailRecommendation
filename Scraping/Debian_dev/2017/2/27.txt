A Github-like interface is totally compatible with the CLI: pull
requests are exposed as branches, you can merge, modify, do anything you
like. The web UI tries to catch up with what you do (if you merge
through the CLI, the web interface will detect that).
As for debiman, I contributed a small CSS fix. If it was hosted on
Alioth instead of Github, I wouldn't have sent any patch. For small
contributions, interacting by email (subscribing to the list, staying
subscribed in case I am not Cc, getting more spams) is not worth the
hassle for me.
