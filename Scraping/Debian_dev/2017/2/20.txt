This position means that people will choose to use a completly non-free
service rather than the service debian provides.
OTOH I think the problem is not that "we don't have github workflow"
but "every maintainer invents their own workflow". We have very
strict policy on what goes into the binary packages. Meanwhile
there is no effective policy how the source should be structured
in git. We need to question if not having package sources in git is 
still useful option  - or even if source package counts a preferred
form for modification. At least "apt-get source" tells me every how
I should probably use git instead...
