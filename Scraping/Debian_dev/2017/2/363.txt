I find it mildly irritating that you are attributing to me some sort of
argument, when instead I made several factual statements and carefully and
very intentionally refused to draw a conclusion from them.  I was simply
trying to provide some additional context because I thought two thread
participants were talking past each other and not talking about the same
thing.
Nowhere in the above did I say that we shouldn't care about the bugs
because they don't directly affect the main line of package development.
In retrospect, I could have made it clearer that I was doing that and that
I wasn't intending to hint at an argument, but also please extend to other
people the benefit of the doubt.
