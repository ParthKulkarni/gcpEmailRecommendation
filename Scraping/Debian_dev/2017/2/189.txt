This is news to me. Policy Â§5.6.13 ('Description') doesn't explicitely
forbid using code (or pseudocode), and even allows for verbatim lines
(which start with two or more spaces).
I wonder if this was a case of the code not being sufficient
description? [IE, code and a good text description would be accepted,
but code only was not?]
