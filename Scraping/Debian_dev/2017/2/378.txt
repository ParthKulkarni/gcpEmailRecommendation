#667965 - don't know whether this still exists. I later decided to patch
dpkg so "unsafe-io" skips *all* calls to *sync. This also works better
in mixed-arch environments.

Indeed. That's why I'm asking for such a hint file: It would allow me to
switch to a more expensive build mode, but a mode that makes the build
pass.

AIUI qemu(-static) cannot handle threading very well. So if a build
process uses such applications, things turn bad. Typical observation was
msgmerge stuck in an endless loop at 100% CPU. Lesson learned: There is
a reason why Debian builds do not use emulation.
