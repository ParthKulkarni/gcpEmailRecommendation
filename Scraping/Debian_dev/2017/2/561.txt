Hi Philip,
Try Linux Hardware database: https://linux-hardware.org/
You can upload a "probe" of your computer hardware to the db, open the probe url and investigate the Linux-compatibility and operability of devices on board. Look at probes and hardware logs of the same computer model and same devices in other models. And do not forget to compare versions of the Linux kernel used.
Maybe someone can help to package the hw-probe utility for Debian: https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe
The Arch Linux package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hw-probe/
Thank you.
