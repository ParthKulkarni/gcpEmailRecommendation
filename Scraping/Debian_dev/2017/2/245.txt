True. We also don't have one recommended way how to write debian/rules, how to
build packages, nor if and which SCM to use and we neither agree on a recommended
debian/source/format, to name a few of the things were Debian is technically
very diverse. Maybe too diverseâ€¦ OTOH this is certainly also a strength.
I'd just like to see more commonly agreed and recommended best practices in
our world. And while we were doing this that we wouldn't have to be ignorant
about alternative realities^wapproaches.
