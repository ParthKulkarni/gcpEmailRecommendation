Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
Hi,
I could really use some help with the ntp (network time protocol)
package. There have been various bugs filed, and I didn't have the
time to properly look at them and deal with them.
It's currently team maintained, but I've been the only one doing
anything the past few years.
Kurt
