Yes, but last time I checked a "apt-get source && debuild -us -uc" still
defaults to using just a single CPU unless you explicitly set
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel. So if this causes the build to fail, it will
directly affect those users least able to figure out what may be wrong.

In my opinion there is a big difference between asking builds to work
with a single CPU, and supporting "all build environments".
