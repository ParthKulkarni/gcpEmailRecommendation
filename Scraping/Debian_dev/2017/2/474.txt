  Description     : Clojure library protecting against timing attacks
 
crypto-equality is a Clojure library for protecting against timing attacks when
comparing strings or sequences of bytes. It is primarily indented for comparing
user-supplied values against secrets held by the application, such as tokens or
keys.
This library is a prerequisite for packaging PuppetDB and/or Puppet Server.
