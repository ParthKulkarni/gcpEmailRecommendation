Actually, it was not obvious for me at all, this is what you wrote:

You mentioned here two things: openssl transition and the BTS glitch
that made buggy packages to propagate to testing. Those were the
"issues of the day" at the time, and are now mostly in the past.
This, and the fact that no other Release Manager fixed your mistake,
is the reason why I believed you meant "freeze" when you wrote "freeze".

Ok, but please let us face the consequences: I downgraded all those
bugs to important because I expected you, Release Managers, to give
some guidelines about how to handle them *before* the release.
If this is not going to happen, I'll have to raise those bugs to
serious again, following your own guideline (see Message #35 from
Julien Cristau) that the bugs are serious as a general rule (because
no other guideline was given so far).
If we really want to skip this issue for stretch, then we should use
stretch-ignore, not severity important.
Do I have your permission to use stretch-ignore here?
[ I would do that on any FTBFS-randomly bug present or future, except
  those packages failing more than 50% of the time, because IMO that
  would be completely absurd ].
Thanks.
