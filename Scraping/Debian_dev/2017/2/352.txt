While I agree with Niels that it would be very worthwhile to be able to define
ressource requirements for a package to build (and thus know I have to life
with some packages having trouble sometimes) I find it *very* strange to be
content with test suites which randomly fail.
How do you know an error in a testsuite is a non-critical one which can be
ignored? *Especialy* if you have flaky tests, how can you be sure (or even
guesstimate) a test failure is harmless one to ignore and not a critical one
which needs acting upon???
I *really* don't get why people advocate keeping unreliable tests enabled in
releases.
