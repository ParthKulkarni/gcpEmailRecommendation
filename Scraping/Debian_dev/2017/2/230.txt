FWIW, I am another user of this workflow...

...and agree as well on the above statements, adding that IMHO releasing
something should always be a manual process, i.e. a real person should
be able to be blamed for ;-)
I have discussed a lot about my workflow with other fellow Debian
members, always because it disrupts automatic building from VCS.  Well,
for this situation IMHO the automatic builder should first calls `dch
-r` with appropriate uploader name/email (e.g. "VCS autobuilder
<vcs-autobuilder@$(hostname -f)>") and, whenever possible, guess the
correct distribution.

I also prefer the first model, i.e. writing debian/changelog entries as
you go along, and I do not see any problem in fixing a previous commit
without changing the corresponding debian/changelog entry.
The debian/changelog is the history of changes for the Debian source
package (.orig.tar.$COMPRESSION, .debian.tar.$COMPRESSION and .dsc). The
VCS changelog is the history of changes to achieve the former (which can
be one or more commits or even a complete branch).  Inflating these 2
histories is IMHO wrong.
Which is also the reason why I do not like debian/changelog with Git
commits entries.

IMHO Debian is so successful exactly because we have not imposed any
constraint, as Holger already pointed out:
