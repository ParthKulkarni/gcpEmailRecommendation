Why do you think this is "very" undesirable?  At worst, you have to ask
the person who committed to the branch what their intention was, and
you're probably talking to them anyway.
(I don't disagree that it could be useful to have the intended suite
indicated.)

Just a terminological point:
I use "finalised" to mean "suite is not UNRELEASED and timestamp is not
behind the last change" -- i.e. `dch -r` has been run and the result
committed.
I suspect I'm not alone in using "finalised" to refer to this, given the
behaviour of `dch`.  It is only the Emacs changelog mode which leaves no
name and e-mail.

If we use dgit for all our uploads then this doesn't really matter :)
