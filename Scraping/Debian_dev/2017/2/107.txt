Demoting #854048 to "so that sssd can automigrate" seems to me to be
abuse of the bug severity; this bug caused serious problems logging in
for users of sssd and the package should not have migrated to testing.
The existence of a work around is not a sufficient reason to do so;
systems that ended up with the upgraded package would end up not coming
up to a login prompt with an unclear root cause.
