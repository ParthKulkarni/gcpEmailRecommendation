  Description     : Progress bar for Django
 This package provides a progress bar for file upload forms in Django, a web
 development framework written Python. The progress bar is implemented on the
 server side via a special view that provides the progress information and
 JavaScript on the client side to poll this view in short intervals. If
 JavaScript is disabled, uploads still work, but there is no progress bar.
As far as I can tell, there is no Django extension so far in Debian that
supports upload progress reporting. I'm using this package already for a
student work submission system.
