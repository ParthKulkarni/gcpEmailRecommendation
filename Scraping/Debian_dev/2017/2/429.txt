Hi Carsten, I have a small request.
When making the package descriptions (that is adding the phrase: This is a transitional package. It can be safely removed), it would be nice for us translators that a . is made between the text and the phrase. That phrase is already translated in most of the active languages. and adding it in a separate sections, means no work for us translators, as opposite to now there we have to run through x number of strings, copy the old text and adding  This is a transitional package. It can be safely removed (translated) in all the sections, go through proofreading/control etc.
It's a small thing then making the package descriptions, but saves us a lot of work.
thanks in advance.
Joe

 Icedove is an unbranded Thunderbird mail client suitable for free distribution.
 The goal of Thunderbird is to produce a cross platform stand-alone mail
 application using the XUL user interface language.
 .
 This package contains the localization of Icedove in Arabic.
 This is a transitional package. It can be safely removed.
 Icedove er en version af postklienten Thunderbird, der ikke markedsføres
 og som er egnet til fri distribution. Målet med Thunderbird er at
 fremstille et uafhængigt postprogram, som fungerer på tværs af platforme
 med brug af sproget for XUL-brugerfladen.

 this should work as the "real" old Icedove packages uses
 ~/.icedove and
 Thunderbird now uses ~/.thunderbird as default.
 But that you probably wont do. You probably want to use
 Icedove on one
 machine and Thunderbird on another machine and you want to
 use the
 profile folder for booth, that will also work if you use
 versions that
 not differ that much. The best would be to only Thunderbird
 or only
 Icedove with the same version.
 
 Combining usage of booth profile folders with symlinking is
 the thing we
 currently talk about to not copy .icedove into
 .thunderbird.
