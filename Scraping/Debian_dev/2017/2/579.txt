It's not even about updating: the first version of chromium with this
build-time tweak simply disabled all already installed extensions for me
so they were not activated when I restarted chromium after that upgrade
session -- and hence were not shown in UI etc.
What's worse, it's futile to attemt to reinstall them: the settings tab
for the extensions works OK, the chromiums "extensions store" (whatever
its real name is, I dunno) works OK, just when you try to install an
extension, you get some mystical error message having nothing to do
with what Debian's build did, and with no hint at what to do next.
I possess the necessary google-fu and I'm a programmer after all, so
that wasn't too hard for me to find the cause and implement the
solution, but for a plain computer user that would be a complete
dead-end.
