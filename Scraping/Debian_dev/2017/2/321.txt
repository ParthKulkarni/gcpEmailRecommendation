On a few cases, I had to increase some test timeouts because of some
people using *very* slow CPUs to build, and complaining about failures.
While I do agree that in theory, packages should be build-able in most
platforms, there's still a limit to that effort.
Let's say you were attempting to build on a 200 MHz x86 CPU, then yes, I
would say it's not reasonable to open bugs and complain about related
problems. Not because there's no bug (there really is, and it should
really be considered a bug), but because we all have a limited amount of
time to spend on each issue, and it's best to focus on more important
things.
