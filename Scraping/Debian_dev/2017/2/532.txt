  Description     : Clojure utility belt library
 
Plumbing includes the following libraries:
 * Graph: a simple and declarative way to specify a structured computation,
   which is easy to analyze, change, compose, and monitor.
 * plumbing.core: a library of very commonly used functions.
 * plumbing.map: common operations on maps (both immutable Clojure maps and
   mutable Java maps)
This library is a prerequisite for packaging PuppetDB and/or Puppet Server.
