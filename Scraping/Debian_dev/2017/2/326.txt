Well, but when I said "Ok, will do" in Bug #844264, it was a reply to
your request to postpone this after the freeze, not after the release.
I definitely don't think we should do absolutely nothing in stretch
about this, so I'll continue to ask for help here in -devel:
Let's consider only the most blatant cases, the ones at the top of the
list I posted before.
Can anyone here reproduce any of the following *two* bugs?
(Using sbuild in a single-CPU machine)
837067  1.000   libsecret
848063  0.990   ri-li
If we could only fix those two for stretch, we will be proudly able to
say, when released as stable, that no package in stretch does fail to
build more than 50% of the time (in a single-CPU machine).
Then we could think of thresholds lower than 50% for buster, but at
least we would avoid the Schr√∂dinger paradox in stretch.
Thanks.
