AFAIK, mdadm's default (and maybe only supported, without some custom scripting) way to report a degraded array is email. That's definitely an important feature as not noticing a degraded array will result in complete data loss (well, or at least restore from backup). 
OTOH, seems weird for Dracut to recommend mdadm. Surely a system booting from RAID would already have it installed?
