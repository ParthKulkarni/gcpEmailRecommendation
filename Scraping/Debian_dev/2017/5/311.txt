  Description     : A plasmoid for the notification and listing of unread emails from your Gmail inbox
Gmail Feed is a plasmoid for Plasma 5. It provides a list of unread
emails from your Gmail inbox. You also get notified when you receive
new messages.
--
To the best of my knowledge there is not yet a plasmoid in the archive
that provides equivalent functionality.  While most KDE users probably
use KMail or Thunderbird, and with KDE5/Plasma Desktop can receive new
email notification from an Android Phone, or allow their browser to
display desktop notifications, I believe that it is useful to provide
an applet such as this--particularly for memory-constrained systems
where productivity is negatively affected by keeping a desktop email
client running.
Things I haven't yet investigated about this package:
  1. Does it support kwallet?
  2. Does it use the IMAP interface and/or OAuth 2.0?
  3. Does it support GMail labels.
      - eg: Are the nofications/lists for IMAP INBOX or for "Primary"
  4. If it supports GMail labels, are they configurable?
I believe that it would probably be best to maintain it as part of the
pkg-KDE team; however, I am not yet part of this team.  Please CC this
bug when replying.  Failing that, I would use a git project in
collab-maint.
In terms of priority/timeline it will be at least a month or two before I have the time to package this.
Cheers,
Nicholas
