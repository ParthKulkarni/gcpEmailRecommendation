Another thing that would be a really neat addition to a wrapper around
Minecraft would be to run it inside a restrictive namespace by default.
Minecraft has a pretty well-understood file access pattern, and there's
really no reason to allow it to read, say, your Firefox cookie database,
or something else that's in your home directory.  You could probably also
cut off quite a lot of syscalls with seccomp without changing the
functionality.
I played around with configurations for a server and can confirm that the
following systemd jailing configuration works for the server, but I'm
quite sure that one could get more restrictive than this with some work
(for example, I didn't even start on syscall filtering).
PrivateUsers=true
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=true
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectControlGroups=true
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectKernelModules=true
