Hi guys,
I have recently-ish moved my private things to another server, and I
think the pagure repo got lost somehow.  I'm currently out of town but
I'll fix this as soon as I get back, next weekend.

I wasn't really using the collab-maint repository because I haven't
created it, but I can move the latest version of my repo there.

It's not that I don't want.  It's that this is my usual workflow when
packaging things on Debian: I do everything on a local git repo, and
then move to collab-maint when the package is ready.

Sure.  I'll move everything to collab-maint as soon as I get back home,
as I said earilier.
