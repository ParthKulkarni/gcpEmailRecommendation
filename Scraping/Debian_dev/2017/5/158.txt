Hi there,
please remember: it is not the design, that makes a website interesting, but 
the content! 
So maybe we should first discuss, and maybe confirm, what might people interest 
on the debian site. 
I suggest just to collect ideas, and make a ranking (i.e. freedom was named 
1563 times, low cost was named 873 times and so on) and then express the top 
ranks on the site. 
IMO for example, "stability" and "freedom" might new users not interest at 
first, but maybe "runs office, multimedia, graphics" or "be safe from windows 
viruses" or "faster than windows" might interest people more than "freedom".
Also the term "cost nothing, for free!" might not interest people, as people 
believe, MS-Windows on computers they buy is also for free (which of course is 
NOT!)
I think, you know, what I want to say. 
Just my 3,1415926.... cents.
Best regards
Hans
