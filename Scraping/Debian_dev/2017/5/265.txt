I've got some different ideas. While it makes sense that packaging-only 
projects on the new VCS hosting system should not enable the issue tracking 
system (people should use Debian BTS instead. Pull Requests should be enabled 
to allow external contribution.), there are many semi-native and native 
packaging projects directly related to Debian.
For example, there are documentation projects like debian-reference and 
debian-handbook, native packages like dpkg, apt and reportbug. In that case, 
the issue tracking *should* be enabled and used. Issue tracking here will act 
as the replacement of mailing lists from lists.alioth.debian.org. (Issue 
tracker acts just like mailling lists. The sole difference is that you must 
start a thread on web interface.)
My opinion is that the use of issue tracking systems should be decided by the 
maintenance/packaging team (for team-maintained pkg) or the repository owner.
