  Description     : Simple, modern & fast web-based email client
Rainloop is a PHP-based MUA with a modern interface and no database requirements.
It supports IMAP and SMTP protocols (including SSL), Sieve scripts, multiple accounts and identities, an admin panel for configuration, and integration with a variety of commonly-used services. Plugins can be installed to further extend functionality. Emails are not stored locally, but are accessed through IMAP.
Debian already has a few webmail packages, but very few with a modern interface style, all of which require a database backend. I created a package for Rainloop for personal use, but I think other Debian users may find it useful as well.
I should be able to handle maintainance myself, as very few changes are required from upstream, but I will need a sponsor.
