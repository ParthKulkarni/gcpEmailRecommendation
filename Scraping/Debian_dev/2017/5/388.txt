Can't it report this via the system log? (syslog, systemd-journald)

dracut defaults to creating a general-purpose initramfs that is not meant
to hard-code anything and can be used to boot "most" hardware (it gets the
root device from the kernel command-line, mounts the root, and reads the
rest of its configuration from there). If the necessary binaries for
modules like mdadm are not present, then they can't be included in the
generated initramfs, leaving it less general-purpose than it is intended
to be.
