I think you are forgetting about the other 90% of the work hereâ€¦
And that is a really huge task, I'm wondering whether actually a GR might be
a useful tool for this:
 [1] Yes, we should shutdown (cvs|svn|git|bzr|$some_more|$actually_a_lot_project_pages|lists).alioth.debian.org 
     and many many cronjobs on 2018-12-31 and make it readonly on 2018-05-31
     (=end of wheezy LTS).
 [2] further discussion.
If we had this GR in say, a month, projects would have almost a year to migrate
their stuff away nicely, and 18 months to do it a bit more painfully.
And it would give the current alioth maintainer(s?) moral support to do what
technically seems somewhat unavoidableâ€¦
The difficulty I here see in wording of the GR, which should not become
bikeshedding, eg. I would leave out such details like how to deal with existing
useraccountsâ€¦
My idea with the GR is to give the alioth maintainers moral support
to shutdown this system, which served us well for so long, now & properly.
Maybe a mailinglist discussion is sufficient for this too ;-)
(All this assuming upgrading it is *really* a hopeless taskâ€¦ somewhat I dont
think it is, eg I guess one could put the app into a container and upgrade the
host to jessie and then stretchâ€¦ but I would really love a clean restart too.
Having a git repo for every Debian package by default and design would
be lovely, despite git is broken because of sha1, yada yada yada.)
I somewhat got distracted from writing a short answer about how some other 90%
are missing in the above "simple description". Guess it's way more complicated
after allâ€¦ so, thanks to all past and current alioth maintainers, I'd like my 
bikeshed blue & new & shiny. ;-)
