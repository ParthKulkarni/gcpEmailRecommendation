Hi,
 During translation of Stretch release note, it says "Lack of security
 support for the ecosystem around libv8 and Node.js"
 https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#libv8
 Then, I'm curious that what is the best way for Debian users, "how to
 create and maintain Node.js environment on Debian Stretch", can anyone
 tell me, please?
 And if it isn't not so large, adding it to release note is better, IMO.
