I agree completely. The ideal of converting all history has a chilling
effect on actually migrating at all; and in the meantime, there's a huge
opportunity cost IMHO, as we've had git for 10 years now there are plenty
of developers who have completely forgotten how to use SVN (like me) or
even never learned it at all.
