  Description     : Circle icon theme from the Numix project
Numix Circle is an extensive icon theme for Linux desktops, with over 4000
application icons. It is developed by the Numix project and serves as a
companion to the base Numix icon theme (numix-icon-theme).
----
Packaging rationale: Numix Circle is an actively maintained, modern icon theme
which covers a wide range of application icons. I have been using it for many
months with no problems, and it helps polish the look of a desktop with a
consistent icon style. This theme complements numix-icon-theme, which only
contains a base set of system (e.g. panel, settings) icons.
Maintenance: I plan to maintain this within the Debian MATE team, as discussed
on #debian-mate (IRC).
