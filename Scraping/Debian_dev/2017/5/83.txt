    Description:
JoclyBoard is a collection of at the moment 96 various
boardgames, including variants of chess, variants of draughts/checkers, 
variants of reversi/othello and many more.
    templating: ability to save and reuse view options / players / 
clock mode
I think it would perfectly fit into the distribution and find a lot of 
people using it within debian.
