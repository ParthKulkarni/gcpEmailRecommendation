This number contains possibly 150 packages that *could* be migrated -
provided somebody wants to take the time for some unproductive work.
However, we intentionally do packaging of new R CRAN packages in SVN
since in this case packaging is brain dead simple and we keep only the
debian/ dir and not the upstream source in VCS.  This is a sensible and
established workflow and currently there is no short term plan to change
this.
In short:  There is no doubt that Git is the better VCS but spending
developer time simply to switch lots of packages from an old VCS to a
modern one has zero effect on users desktops and has no high priority.
Kind regards
       Andreas.
