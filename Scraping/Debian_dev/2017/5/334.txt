  Description     : Unofficial way to easily install game
[This work does 'not' contain the Minecraft itself as that would breach
copyright laws and the wishes of authors]
This installer project causes downloaded from the official Mojang server to get
the files where I am NOT redistributing your files.
Minecraft (https://minecraft.net) is game about placing blocks to build
anything you can imagine.
At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as
the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.
