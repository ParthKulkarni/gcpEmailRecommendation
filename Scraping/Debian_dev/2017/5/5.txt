How would you expect the case "local admin has copied over the file
from /usr to /etc to apply local changes, and a new package version
changes its defaults so that the service wouldn't run with an
unadapted configuration any more" to be handled?
The Debian way will handle this through conffile managent or ucf,
making the local admin immediately aware of the changes, while the way
you advocate would make the admin end up with a (probably silently)
failed service, broken by a simple package upgrade.
And I am not yet bringing the case where the package maintainer fixes
a security issue by a configuration change in the game.

Having configuration in /usr without a possibility to override it via
/etc is a policy violation, isn't it`
