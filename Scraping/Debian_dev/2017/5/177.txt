I appreceate the effort you have done on the kernel repository.
OTOH it might just not be worth to convert all project histories into
git. Linus didn't do it for upstream kernel either. Convert the easy
cases automatically and leave the rest ones for maintainers as an
opportunity to do a clean start.
Else we risk delaying moving forward because time is spent supporting
esoteric legacy workflows.
