'Best documentation' is a strong claim that I don't think many would agree with :-)
Debian is many good things, but 'well documented', especially for
newcomers, is not one of them. Several other distros demonstrably do a
better job on this (Arch, Ubuntu spring to mind).
I will refrain from making further comments on the website except that
I like Debian's style much more than the lxde 'vertical sliding pane
minimal-info' thing that is quite popular these days. But then I am
old, favour substance over style, and don't use a tiny phone screen to
read the net. The more I see of the modern web, the more I become
convinced of the long-term advantages of 30K of HTML over 1MB of
javascript to convey essentially the same info.
I will observe that the debian wiki is a lot more up-to-date than the
website because it is much easier to update (much as I admire wml as
a tool/language).
