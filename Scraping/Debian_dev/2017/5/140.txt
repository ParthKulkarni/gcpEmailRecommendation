OK, good.
I don't have any clear idea show close the views of the Debian project
as whole are to the ones I expressed in my article, but I'm pretty
sure that my views as expressed there are at least those of a
significant and vocal minority :-).  They might even be the majority
view, but we sowouldn't be able to tell without a GR - and let's not.
Thanks,
Ian.
