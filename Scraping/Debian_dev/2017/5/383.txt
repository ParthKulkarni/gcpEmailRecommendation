That's true.
I'd say the biggest problem is maintainers having an emotional attachment to
their packages and thus overestimating their importance.
A random example (not meant to single out its maintainer):
libuuid1 (transitively essential) Recommends: uuid-runtime.
The latter is, as far as I understand, needed only if you generate a massive
number of uuids per seconds.  Packages that actually need so (like ceph)
actually Depend: uuid-runtime already.  The rest -- those which need a
single uuid per mkfs or so, are perfectly fine without that daemon.
Thus, axing this dependency or degrading it to Suggests would be probably a
good idea.  And there's hundreds if not thousands of Recommends of this kind
that need to be looked at -- this example is just more prominent as it
affects every Debian system.
(I'm not filing bugs yet as it's better to have a consensus first before
mass-filing.)

On the other hand, corpo lager is not a race.
