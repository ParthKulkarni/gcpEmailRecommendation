I think it's more likely it's about grub.
Alexandr: does that menu have a blue background?  If so, please google
"windows restore mbr" and use one of guides that applies to your version of
Windows.  It'll be easier as your Windows installation is already bootable
so you don't need any rescue media.  I can't offer you more detailed
assistance, though, as I haven't ran Windows outside a VM for a while.
I wish you luck if you ever find the time to try Debian again.
