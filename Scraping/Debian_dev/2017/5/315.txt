Please consider joining the Games Team. We have Quake enthusiasts who
can probably help with this package and/or sponsor your uploads.
(We also maintain all the other Quake engines packaged so far.)
In particular, Michael Gilbert maintains ezquake in the Games Team.
I try not to maintain heavily multiplayer-focused games, so I'm unlikely
to want to co-maintain mvdsv myself; but I do co-maintain the more
single-player-focused Quake engines, the game-data-packager tool that
packages the required game data, the quake-server package that wraps
systemd units and sysvinit scripts around the various Quake engines,
and the Debian Quake mini-policy.
The debian-devel-games mailing list is an appropriate place for discussion
of these packages.
