  Description     : Library to handle Java artifact repositories
Apache Maven Artifact Resolver is a library for working with artifact
repositories and dependency resolution. Maven Artifact Resolver deals
with the specification of local repository, remote repository, developer
workspaces, artifact transports and artifact resolution.
This library is basically the successor of Eclipse Aether which was
migrated from Eclipse to the ASF. It is required to upgrade Maven
to the version 3.5. Like eclipse-aether the maven-resolver package will
be maintained by the Java Team.
