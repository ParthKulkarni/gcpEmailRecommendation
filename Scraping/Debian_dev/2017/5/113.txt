That makes sense.
I am currently working on a personal project that involves deployment to
my private server. I have Debian packaging for it, and I have a make
target that will take the most current code, apply the Debian packaging,
build a binary package, scp it to my server, and install it.  Whenever I
am ready to deploy a new version, doing it is just on command away.
An alternative to waiting for bikesheds and for waiting for the full
archive dance could be DSA providing a similar system for service
maintainers. They would upload one or more binary packages (alongside a
signed .changes, and maybe we also want the corresponding full source)
for their service. On the receiving end, the system would install those
binary packages after verifying signatures, and perhaps also a whitelist
of binary packages that the service maintainer in question can submit.
