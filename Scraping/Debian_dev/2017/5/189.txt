I assume that you mean a read-only dump of all the old CVS repos, which
could be hosted on a newer-than-wheezy machine?

I /believe/ that the reason we have the monolithic DHG_packages is
because we frequently have to upload every or almost every Haskell
package at once (e.g. bump all build-deps to use new ghc and upload to
experimental).
I don't think it's because the workflow for packaging any given Haskell
package is very simple, which was what Andreas mentioned w.r.t. R.
