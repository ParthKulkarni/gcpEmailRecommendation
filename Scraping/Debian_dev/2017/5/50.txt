Package: general
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
I tried turning off bluetooth via the icon in the upper toolbar in Gnome 3 in
Wheezy oldstable, which I run WITH hardware acceleration on PowerMac G5 Quad, a
feature I obtained easily without troubleshooting kernel recompiles in Stable.
It's nouveau on a Quadro FX 4500. :)
Besides that "nudge" or "hint" on improving nouveau on stables and testings,
I'd like to notify that turning off the bluetooth via the feature up top only
disables for the running session. Upon rebooting, it's back on.
This is a request to implement that turning off the bluetooth is remembered for
the respective user.
Thank you
