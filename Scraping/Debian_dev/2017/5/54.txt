  Description     : secure remote debugging
> Debugging a problem over email/irc/BTS is slow, tedious, and hard. The
> developer needs to see the your problem to understand it. Debug-me aims
> to make debugging fast, fun, and easy, by letting the developer access
> your computer remotely, so they can immediately see and interact with
> the problem. Making your problem their problem gets it fixed fast.
>
> A debug-me session is logged and signed with the developer's GnuPG
> key, producing a chain of evidence of what they saw and what they
> did. So the developer's good reputation is leveraged to make debug-me
> secure.
