There are some pages about the alternative of FusionForge on Debian Wiki but 
they fail to describe the final decision:
[1] https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth/GitNext
[2] https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth/OtherForges
[3] https://wiki.debian.org/Shukra (for GitLab)
And I found a long thread on debian-devel saying GitLab won't be used due to 
controversy:
[4] https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/07/msg00510.html
If that's true, I will later update [1] according to [4], remove GitLab from 
the option list and describe pagure as the most possible sucessor of 
FusionForge. Tell me if that's not correct.
However, note that pagure is lacking features. For example, the authentication 
method only includes FAS (Fedora Account System) and local (local database). 
Obviously we need to implement support for Debian SSO/LDAP and migrate alioth 
account system by ourselves. (GitLab supports LDAP & OAuth2 [3] but anyway we 
are not using it.) I'm wondering where should related development work 
happens.
