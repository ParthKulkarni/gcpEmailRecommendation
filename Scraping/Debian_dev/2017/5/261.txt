Just a heads up, public announcement will follow as soon as I have all
details. We plan a alioth sprint from 18th to 20th august, probably in
Hamburg, Germany. If you want to take part, please reserve the date. Yes I
know it is near to debconf, but otherwise it will happen a lot later and we
don't have that much time left (mostly my fault, but time isn't endless). 
I started a wiki page for the sprint [1]. You can add yourself if you are
interested. If you are interested in sponsoring the sprint please get in
touch with me. 
Thanks for your attention
