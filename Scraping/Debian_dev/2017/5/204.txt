_this_!
I can totally confirm this. When people ask me how to get foo fixed in Debian
and I start explaining the above, people role their eyes and point to this:

and then most of these people move on without bothering trying to fix it.
there have been a few trying to stick around but often they dont know where
to move on, as there is no "Debian workflow", no "Debian manual", there's just
a hundred Debian workflows to maintain a package and 200 manuals for that.
The nice thing about standards is *not* that there are so many to choose from.
