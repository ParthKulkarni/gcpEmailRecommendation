I don't think so (speaking as listmaster and alioth admin). Our lists.d.o is
not really suited as a self-service. Where I would be open to the creation of
important lists, I am not so happy on the other side about having a few
hundred new lists on alioth. 
Our list setup is pretty special and I don't think we will ever be able to
move to something else (and there are not many alternatives. Mailman 3 is not
really an option).
Just my 2 cents
