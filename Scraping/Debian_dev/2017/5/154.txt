I took a look at the Gentoo website and there's more than just better CSS.
I find it much better than the Debian one.
The things which are improvements compared to Debian:
- the frontpage is really only a (dynamic) portal to many other services,
  the main content does not duplicate what's already in the
  header/footer, they do not waste real estate uselessly
- every time that a somewhat lengthy explanation is needed, they direct
  users to their Handbook so that they do not duplicate instructions
  in multiple places
- they have more pictures and icons to illustrate and make it easier on the eyes
- their "get started" and "download" page are really visually appealing
  and very clear whereas our simple "bullet list" look like unstructured in
  comparison
- the two menu bars show clearly where you are within the website (in
  Debian we have no such visual indication), the headers/footers are
  easily identified compared to the main content
  
The only downside of Gentoo's website is the lack of translations.
