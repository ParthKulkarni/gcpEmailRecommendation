  Description     : Download, manage and change your favorite wallpapers from
the Internet
WallpaperDownloader is a GUI Java-based application for downloading, managing
and setting wallpapers from different sources. Currently there are five
providers implemented. It allows the user to define keywords in order to
download those wallpapers which fit the search terms. Users can bookmark their
favorite wallpapers too, delete those who don't want to keep and move them to
another location. It implements a background changer to change automatically
the wallpaper in 1,5,10,30 or 60 minutes. It currently support a lot of Desktop
Environments including Plasma 5, GNOME Shell, Unity, XFCE and MATE.
Additional information
- I think this package is useful for people who likes wallpapers and loves to
download, manage and change them automatically using a GUI and using their own
keywords. I use it on a daily basis and a lot of people is currently using it
because it is published in the Ubuntu Store (as a snap package:
https://uappexplorer.com/app/wallpaperdownloader.egarcia) and in AUR for Arch
Linux (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wallpaperdownloader/). There are some
other packages providing the same functionality (as Variety for example), but I
think WallpaperDownloader is the only one which allows the user to define
exactly the search terms to find their favorite wallpapers.
- WallpaperDownloader is currently under development and new features are
included in every release. This is the Wiki of the project, so you can check
all the history, versions, features and more:
