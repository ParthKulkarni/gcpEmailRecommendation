And your thinking is based on what arguments?  As I tried to explain I'm
perfectly convinced that Git is way better in most cases - but those
superior features are not needed in all cases.  The only thing that would
save me some time in the cases I mentioned is that I from time to time
type
       svn commit -a
       git commit -a
if I actually mean
       svn commit
:-)

Hmmm, if those packages received any NMUs the NMUer never commited
anything anyway - so this argument is void.

I'm willing to adapt to such decision but I feel my time totally wasted
to do a SVN versus Git flamewar (and this is my last mail regarding
this).

Surely we doesn't have to support various workflows but these have
developed over the time and I never had the impression that changes
in Debian happened with dead beat arguments.

I fully agree and I'm known for team highjacking packages into Git
repositories in several cases (and was also critizised about doing so).

If we really could agree upon a common workflow I will definitely adapt.
But there is no such agreement as far as I can see.  Please take my
previous mail rather as an explanation for the current state than my
definite wish to keep the status quo under any circumstance.

Kind regards
