Actually I agree as a user already using GNU/Linux, but for new users it
might have different experience.

Agreed. I would argue that the page is too empty and every piece of news
information in the home page needs a click to view.  It could be nice to
expose a little bit more for the news articles.
Also we need something like "Why Debian?", but it could be better
represented in another page with colorful pictographs.  We need to call
designers' help for this.
