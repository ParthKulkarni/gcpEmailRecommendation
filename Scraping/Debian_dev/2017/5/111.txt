Right. IIRC that was said to me at Debconf16 about Debian-specific
services (such as ci.debian.net which was the context of my question).
It makes sense to prefer packages for something that has a proper
upstream that is not us, which is the case in this discussion.
In any case, it would be super useful to have this explicitly documented
at the DSA website.
