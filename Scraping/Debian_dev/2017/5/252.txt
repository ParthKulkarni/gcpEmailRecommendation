I can see the attraction of this, and it would certainly be easier to get
project consensus around factual stuff like that than the issue of having a
single, project-blessed, infrastructure-hosted replacement, but without such a
replacement being in-place, we will have a diaspora of projects and packages
going to all sorts of different places, which would be a disaster IMHO from
a contributor-complexity POV.
