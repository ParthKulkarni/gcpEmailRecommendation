  Description     : External-Memory Sorting in Java
 This Java class enables sorting large file without first loading them
 into memory. It is using External Sorting by dividing the files into
 small blocks, sort each block in RAM, and then merge the result.  Many
 database engines and the Unix sort command support external sorting.
 It is possible to sort in a non-lexicographic order.
Remark: I'm packaging this as a precondition for the Debian Med package
 tn-seqexplorer.  Since it is pure Java and it has turned out to be a good
 idea to keep those packages in Debian Java team it will be maintained at
