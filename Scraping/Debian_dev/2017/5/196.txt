I wonder in how far is the question obvious when I tried to explain that
I do not see a good reason to spent time into a migration from SVN to
Git.  I have converted lots of packages where I had good reasons.
I admit that it would be a good reason if the project would decide to
support Git exclusively - but I for myself do not see any reason to
drive this decision.
Kind regards
     Andreas.
