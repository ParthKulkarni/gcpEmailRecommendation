All right. If that is the case, disabling issue tracking / ticketing function 
is doable on the new VCS hosting platform. Pagure has separate global config 
switch on those functions. [1]
...but I believe we must enable the Pull Request system (if there's any). 
That's one of the killer features current Alioth is lacking. Sending patches 
onto Debian BTS or maillists is really painful and that prevents people from 
making contributions, especially for those not that familiar with Debian's 
development.
