  Description     : Fast, portable and high-quality zip cracking library featuring bruteforce, dictionary and plaintext attack modes.
libzc is a fast, portable and high-quality zip breaking library. It
targets exclusively the earlier PKZIP-2.0 cipher (just like fcrackzip,
and pkcrack).
It is entirely written in C (no assembly language, so very portable)
and has very little dependencies. Currently, only zlib and libcheck
(for unit tests) are required to build it.
The bruteforce algorithm uses threads to scale with the number of
cores available (unlike fcrackzip) and is written in a way that is
easily vectorizable by modern compilers.
The library also implements the full plaintext attack described by the
Biham & Kocher paper (like pkcrack).
Last, a simple dictionary attack is also offered.
As an added bonus, a command line client (yazc, Yet Another Zip
Cracker) also comes bundled with the library.
So in conclusion, it compares to both fcrackzip and pkcrack, only
faster, cleaner and more portable.
Benchmark using the zip file from fcrackzip (cpu is an Intel Core i7@
3GHz):
$ time fcrackzip -b -ca -u noradi.zip
real	0m18.011s
user	0m17.972s
sys	0m0.008s
$ time yazc bruteforce -t8 -a noradi.zip
real	0m1.962s
user	0m15.440s
sys	0m0.012s
libzc was 9x faster in this test than fcrackzip.
I've never packaged anything for Debian so I need a sponsor 
to get this uploaded.
