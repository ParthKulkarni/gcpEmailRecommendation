  Description     : a modern QuakeWorld server
mvdsv (MultiView Demo Server) is a QuakeWorld-compatible server that is the most
common Quake server used today[0]. There are two other available quake servers
in Debian, quakespasm and darkplaces. quakespasm uses the FitzQuake network
protocol, while darkplaces uses DARKPLACES7. Both are incompatible with the
QuakeWorld network protocol. There is an overview of (incompatible) Quake
network protocols[1].
mvdsv fills the gap by being QuakeWorld-compatible, allowing to use the most
popular clients, ezquake and nQuake (which is just a fancy installer for
ezquake), and also offering many features not available in the other Quake
servers.
The documentation is severely lacking, I plan on writing the man page and the
list of config file parameters as part of the packaging process.
I will be maintaining it alone. Since Quake has been out for 20+ years now, I
don't expect a quick release cycle, so the maintenance burden for this package
will be minimal.
I'm open to co-maintaining this package if any individual or team is interested.
I will need a sponsor for this package.
