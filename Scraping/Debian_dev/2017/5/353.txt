Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
I request assistance with maintaining the pngquant package.
The package description is:
 pngquant is a command-line conversion utility to quantize and dither truecolor
 PNG images, especially those with a full alpha channel, down to 8-bit (or
 smaller) RGBA-palette PNGs. Such images are usually two to four times smaller
 than the full 32-bit versions, and partial transparency is preserved quite
 nicely. This makes pngquant especially useful both for Web sites and for
 PlayStation 2 development, where one of the texture formats is
 RGBA-palette-based (though not PNG-compressed).
 This is the same technique used for many of the images on the Miscellaneous
 Transparent PNGs page (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngs-img.html), and
 the results are often indistinguishable from the original, truecolor PNG
 images.
 .
 Optimizers (like pngcrush and optipng) optimize the compression, usually
 losslessly, while pngquant quantizes colors down to 256 (or fewer) distinct
 RGBA combinations, which is lossy.
Thank you very much!
Best regards,
Nelson
