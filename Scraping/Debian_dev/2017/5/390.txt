Maybe exim should easily provide or default to authenticated smarthost
(satellite) configuration and /etc/aliases should be configured to
forward system mail somewhere else (eg: the sysadmin's work email, in
case of SMART or md errors)?
Alternatively, if a real MTA is too heavy, why not install msmtp-mta
by default?  It (including msmtp) is only ~336K, and it's easy to set
up for authenticated SMTP.  Exim4-daemon-light is ~1292KB.  Maybe
these aren't easy enough to configure?  Does the following need to be
revisited?: https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/DefaultMTA
Are there people who wouldn't appreciate an email from smartd or md
warning them a hard drive is about to fail or that there is something
wrong with their array?  For desktops, it's way too easy to miss a
notification popup, assuming a notification system is installed...and
not all desktops have integrated smart monitoring, and not all users
install gsmartcontrol.  All users should receive notification of
hardware failure, no?  As I see it the issue is if an admin receives
uncountable apt-listchanges emails for something like when a great
many containers are upgraded, and it should be possible to skip
configuration (and disable) any provider of mail-transport-agent for
VMs and containers.
