mdadm reported events are usually critical ones.
If I remember correctly, these events also appear in system log.
But, even if I use logcheck, it too easy to miss such events in
system logs (or logcheck reports) : there are too many events
(or too many false positives for logcheck).
mails from mdadm are really an very important feature for me.
