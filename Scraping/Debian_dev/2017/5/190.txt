I like this suggestion.

I confirm that I once had a short look into DHG_packages and I vaguely
considered this as a potential solution for R packages.  What keeps me
away from implementing it is that it also includes a change of workflows
(not only of users but also tools that are inspecting VCS need to be
rewritten).  So for the moment not to change a running system is my
prefered way to go - but thanks for the hint anyway.
Kind regards
      Andreas.
