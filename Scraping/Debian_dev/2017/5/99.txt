Hi all,
I promised carnil on irc to look into the security issues for jbig2dec, 
but I cannot do that the next days due to work¹ and isp² issues.
Someone with better time and bandwidth please look into making an NMU 
for jbig2dec.
My regular email address dr@jones.dk is currently down² - if needed, I 
should be reachable at the alternative address jonas@homebase.dk

¹ I do live video streaming for a theater performance, and have run into 
big challenges with unreliable bandwisth now few days before the 
premiere.
² To make matters worse, my DSL line got cut off (and it's a cheap 
consumer subscription where I cannot report failures during weekends). 
Quite likely our new competing ISP broke the wire digging holes to lay 
out fibre optics.
