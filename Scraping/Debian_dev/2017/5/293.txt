  Description     : Library for manipulating block devices
  libblockdev is a C library supporting GObject introspection for manipulation of
  block devices. It has a plugin-based architecture where each technology (like
  LVM, Btrfs, MD RAID, Swap,...) is implemented in a separate plugin, possibly
  with multiple implementations (e.g. using LVM CLI or the new LVM DBus API).
This will soon be used by udisks [1], see that PR for details of the rationale.
In short, this will replace the coarse/brittle command line tool interfacing
with a proper library which will also be used in different storage management
related tools.
Peter and Andreas did the brunt of the packaging at [2], I'll give it a review
and some fine-tuning soon. This will be maintained under the Utopia umbrella,
the project which already maintains udisks, upower, libatasmart, and other
hardware related plumbing stack parts.
If anyone else is interested, co-maintenance is highly welcome and appreciated!
Thanks,
Martin
