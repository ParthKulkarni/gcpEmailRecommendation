Improving things doesn't mean destroying identity. We add and remove
archs, we added graphical installer, we don't configure graphics

You could add the quote on which I quoted (lxde page doesn't say it can
be installable on linux) so my comment makes more sense and afaik, lxde
also can be installed on freebsd and hurd. I am there in hopes that
Debian will outlive all current things. :)
