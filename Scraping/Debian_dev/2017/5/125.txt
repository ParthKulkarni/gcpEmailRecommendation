I'm a relative newcomer, and I'm less than 30 years old, and one thing
that attracted me to Debian was the website's not being like lxde.org :)
More generally, while I agree that we should be flexible in the pursuit
of new contributors and users, we mustn't lose our identity in that
process.

We have Linux, HURD and the FreeBSD kernel, though.  I suspect the
thought was Debian hopes its practices, values and community will
outlive any specific kernel, just like they could outlive apt/dpkg.
