  Description     : Retrieve the list of remote desktop servers for a user
 This tiny Python tool will be part of bringing Arctica Greeter (derived
 from Ubuntu's Unity Greeter) to Debian. This tool fetches JSON based
 remote server information from a brokerage host (formerly knows as UCCS
 server). This tool will be used by the to-be-provided
 remote-logon-service package.
 .
 Around 2012, Canonical Ltd. developed a remote logon feature for Unity
 Greeter that supported FreeRDP logons. Citrix Logons were planned, too,
 but never finished (IIRC). The corresponding components in Ubuntu are
 thin-client-config-agent and remote- login-service.
 .
 The X2Go project (i.e. me) later on provieded patches for X2Go Sessinn
 logon support via Unity Greeter, but those patches never got upstreamed.
 And the UCCS remote logon concept has been discontinued ever since AFAIK.
 .
 The continuation (and improvements) of Unity Greeter's remote logon feature will
 be published under the name Arctica Greeter (i.e., greeter frontend for LightDM).
 As a UCCS-like server, the X2Go Session Broker can be used. However, in the
 Arcitca Project's context, we also plan to provide such a brokerage feature which
 then can be plugged into Arctica Greeter.
 .
 The components in Ubuntu are thin-client-config-agent and remote-login-service.
 The forked projects provide the continuation of those projects in a completely
 different name space. Thus, the named Ubuntu packages and the forked packages
 should be co-installable.
