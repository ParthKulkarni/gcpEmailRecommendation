I'd specifically want a kind of mass-filing: let's make a long list and
discuss it in a d-devel flamewar all at once, so we'd have some consistency.
Let's do it after Jun 18, though -- a bug filed today can't be acted on
immediately thus it'd be forgotten even if it's a single word change.
Applying an usertag would be useful, yeah, thanks for the reminder.
