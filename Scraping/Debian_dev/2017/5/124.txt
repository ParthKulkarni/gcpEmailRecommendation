Then lets forget about getting newcomers (fresh blood) to Debian as
you're so close minded to modern/new things - the same way they probably
close the window when they see '90 style with a lot of text that
actually says nothing. We are strange with our talks last few debconfs -
we want new people but we don't want to break our precious habits nor do
we want to give freedom to others to express themselves if they don't
fit into our circle of thinking which must be the best one.

Well Debian on its page doesn't mention it is Linux based or has Linux
kernel or at all word Linux. And short sentences are fine - no one is
forcing you to learn all plane parts and how it works to just board it
and come from point A to B. If we want users, you need to understand
that they just want a nice looking and working OS, they don't want to be
preached about it. For devs - we just need to have something like "Want
To Become Debian Developer" and link it to some good doc.
