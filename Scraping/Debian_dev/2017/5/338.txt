  Description     : Ayatana Indicators panel applets shared library
 This library contains information to build indicators to go into
 the Ayatana Indicator based panel applets.
 .
 The libayatana-indicator project is a fork of
 https://launchpad.net/libindicator that has been stripped-off of all
 Ubuntu-specific elements. It builds against and runs on top of a vanilla
 GTK-3 (or GTK-2), no Ubuntu-specific patches in GTK-3 are required.
 Ubuntu and Canonical namespaces (e.g. in DBus) have been fully dropped.
 .
 With this shared library, developers can code indicator based applets
 (GTK-2 and GTK-3 are supported currently) for modern desktop integration.
