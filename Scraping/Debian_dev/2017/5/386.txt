With the exception of maintaining Recommends for mail-transport-agent
for packages where emailed warnings are highly desirable (there might
be others besides smartd and mdadm), I agree that there are many cases
were Recommends can be downgraded to Suggests.  My pet peeve is
unnecessary Recommends on texlive packages, but it's easy enough to
type "NO" and then install with --no-install-recommends...but if you
mass-file "please degrade Recommends to Suggests" I hope it will be
for a few of those :-)
