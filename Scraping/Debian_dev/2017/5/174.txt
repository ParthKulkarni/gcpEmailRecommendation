Let's say VCS hosting, not git hosting.

Would gitolite be able to support the most popular types of git hooks
(e.g. mail and IRC notifications for pushes)?

There is no free lunch.Â Â The more we want to be able to control our
code hosting, the more time Debian people will have to spend on it over
the long term.Â Â I don't think it makes much difference whether the
implementation is monolithic or put together from more independent
pieces.

Here's a tally of live packaging repositories hosted on Alioth, based
on Vcs fields for sources in unstable:
$ for type in arch bzr cvs darcs git hg mtn svn; do

git: 18907
svn: 2377
bzr: 71
hg: 27
darcs: 22
arch: 7
cvs: 2
mtn: 0
It looks like git hosting would cover ~90% and git+svn would cover
>99%.
