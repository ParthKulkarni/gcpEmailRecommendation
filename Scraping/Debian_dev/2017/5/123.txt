http://lxde.org/ seems to be the site in question. I agree with Paul,
I don't like it, and when I encounter pages in that style, I tend to
close the window.
* It's not nearly information-dense enough. www.debian.org is too
  dense, but the lxde one goes too far in the other direction.
  Something in between would be good.
* It's hard for me to navigate or to find anything. It has a short
  one-sentence summary ("Desktop environment for all"), but nowhere on
  the front page does it mention that it works on Linux. That
  information is probably on some other page, linked from the front
  page, but finding that is someone else's job.
