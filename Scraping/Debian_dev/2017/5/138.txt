I don't know what these terms mean.  I see four kinds of ways in which
a website might be `dynamic' as opposted to `static':
 * Content which is updated fairly frequently and relates to recent
   events, such as news stories, blog posts, and testimonials.
   I have no objection to this kind of thing and I can see how it
   might make our website seem more exciting.
 * Websites which reorganise themselves through CSS and/or JavScript
   to try to produce a better selection of visibloe bits depending on
   the screen size.
   I find these mildly annoying, but I don't use a smartphone and
   apparently smartphones are terrible at laying out ordinary web
   pages (because wtf?).  I don't really object to this kind of
   approach so long as all features remain accessible (perhaps through
   extra clicks) even on small screens, and there is sensible fallback
   if JavaScript and/or CSS are not supported.
 * Websites with elements which, when you move the mouse, pop up
   menus, change shape or colour, etc. etc.  I find these intensely
   irritating.  Often they are buggy too.
 * Websites with elements which move even when you don't touch the
   computer.  This is an outrage - an outrage, I tell you!  That
   web browsers even honour this kind of thing by default is a
   travesty.  Rant rant rant.
Can some webby person please tell me the conventional names for these
four levels of dynamism ?

That sounds like it would be nice, but it shouldn't take away from the
navigation parts of our site.  We have a lot of information; the
problem I find is that it can be difficult to find.
