Hi there, 
just a suggestion/idea. IMO it might be a good idea and advertisement to 
debian, if people could see on the website, that debian is one of the most 
used linuces in the world. It should also be strong pointed to, that debian is 
the source of ubuntu. You may also point to, that debian is running (as my 
actual knowledge) on most servers in the web.
Maybe other things, that people do not know yet, which show the power of 
debian, should be mentioned (I think of biggest community, best documentation, 
best tested software and all the things, that make debian so famous).
The website should proudly express all the goodness of debian, there are so 
many, that the site is not showing at the moment. Make eyecatchers, that 
people want to know more about it! It is it worth!
Just an idea, maybe you like it. If not, it is also ok, I am already a fan. :)
Best regards
Hans
