Package: tss2
Version: 851
Severity: wishlist
I plan to create a new package, tss2, which is developed by Kenneth 
Goldman from IBM.
TSS2 is a user space Trusted Computing Group's Software Stack (TSS) for  
TPM 2.0.
It implements the functionality equivalent to the TCG TSS working 
group's ESAPI, SAPI,
and TCTI layers (and perhaps more) but with a hopefully far simpler 
interface.
It comes with about 80 "TPM tools" that can be used for rapid 
prototyping, education
The package is of BSD license.  The following is the current URL for the 
upstream package:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmtpm20tss/files/ibmtss851.tar
