Hi everyone,
I am sending this mail to the development list of the distributions
CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu. I am working for
ProfitBricks and we provide public images in our cloud for these
distributions.
Currently I know no way to retrieve the release information about
new/updated ISO and disk images in a machine parsable and secure way.
Instead I have to visit the websites and collect the information
manually.
My idea is to create a (simple) image release information specification
and let every distribution provide one release file which accessible
via https or gpg signed. I created an initial draft of the spec:
https://github.com/bdrung/image-release-spec
Your thoughts? Does it make sense? Is the information already provided
somewhere else?
