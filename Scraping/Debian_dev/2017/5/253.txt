Here are my two cents and current plans:
I don't think alioth as it is has a future. It is too overloaded, a bad
software base and not well maintained (I am sorry for that). 
I think that we should move the relevant services into new hosts/services. In
the first step that would be:
Must have:
- Account management - I am thinking about using freeipa for that
- Git Hosting - we want to give pagure [1] a try, which uses gitolite, which is a
  nice git solution. Regarding Hooks, no, we don't want anyone to use
  arbitrary hooks. This is just opening a (security) can of worms. But we
  want to provide hooks as a service. Pagure also has issue tracking. 
Nice to have:
- SVN / CVS Hosting (SVN as there a still a lot of users and CVS for webml)
- Mailinglists
Things I/we don't want in the future:
- Shell Hosting
- More or less obsolete Version Controlsystems, like Darcs, Bazar and so on.
We should strip down the future set to a working and maintainable minimum. 
Just my 2 cent
