This is nothing new though. For example, DBus has had the /usr and
/etc split since as far back as I can remember. (Granted, DBus isn't
a great example, because I consider its configuration to be quite
horrible for an end-user, especially because it's XML.)
Another example: Firefox stores its default preferences in
/usr/share/firefox-esr/browser/defaults/preferences/firefox.js,
and while there is /etc/firefox-esr/firefox.js, that is applied as
a delta. (Plus then the user's local configuration is applied as
a delta on top of that.)
binfmt-support, the Debian-specific way of adding binfmts to the
kernel [1], is _only_ configured in /usr/share/binfmts. There is
no way for users to override this other than by using dpkg-divert.
The entire XDG menu and MIME specifications are built around the
defaults being in /usr and /usr/local.
LXC's configuration system works via includes, and containers
created by the default templates just add
   include /usr/share/lxc/config/$TYPE.common.conf
to the container's specific configuration file.
The current X server supports split-snippets in
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d and /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d - and all
Debian packages that install snippets put them in /usr/share.
(Granted, most are part of the X11 project.)
dput-ng searches for its configuration in /usr/share/dput-ng,
/etc/dput.d and ~/.dput.d. (Plus /etc/dput.cf and ~/.dput.cf
for compatibility reasons.) You can't get more Debian-specific
than that. And support for dput.d is 5 years old already.
The nano editor's default configuration has
include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"
in /etc/nanorc.
AppArmor has
Include /usr/share/apparmor
in its default configuration.
There are likely quite a few more examples.
My point is just the following: this is really nothing new.
Some packages have been doing things like this for over a
decade. Of course, since systemd is quite a central component
to a system, this has become more prominent, but the systemd
authors were not the first to implement a scheme like this.
And if you look at the subtle differences between all of the
examples I've provided in how they read stuff from /usr, I'm
pretty sure that several of them came up with that type of
scheme independently of each other. Which is why the list of
examples I've provided is not necessarily a list of "good"
examples in the sense that "yes, they're doing it right",
but rather a list of examples that demonstrate that this
scheme scratches a very real itch.
And as I said in other places in this thread: I personally
think that the separate /usr <-> /etc scheme is much better
than just storing everything in /etc, so I would really
prefer if as much software as possible would switch to that,
but do it consistently, following e.g. dput-ng or systemd,
but not for example like binfmt-support.
Regards,
Christian
[1] This is _not_ systemd. systemd introduced an own scheme via
    /usr/lib/binfmt.d + /etc/binfmt.d, which no package in Debian
    sid or stretch currently uses.
    And note that binfmt-support has always worked that way, for
    at least 15 years, way before systemd came around.
