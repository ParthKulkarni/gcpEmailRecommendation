I'm a little bit confused. The bug forwarding address in #829046 points at 
http://git.sergiodj.net/, however I couldn't find packaging for pagure 
anywhere. Seems all deleted sometime before.
The repository on collab-maint stops at September 2016 and lacks the work 
around December 2016.
Could you tell me where can I find the proper packaging repository?
Thanks!
