The Debian Perl Group switched from svn to git in Summer 2011.
(And removed /svn/pkg-perl on Alioth in Summer 2012, except for a
README, IIRC).
What these statistics show is that apparently we have 285 packages
which we haven't uploaded since then. And maybe also that keeping the
VCS information in the source package has some disadvantages :)
Cheers,
