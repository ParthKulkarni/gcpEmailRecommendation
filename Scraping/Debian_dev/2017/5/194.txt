a.) git is a lot faster than svn on most operations, which btw does not allow
one to get things done faster, but also enables one to do things which one
would never do with svnâ€¦ (because its just so damn slowâ€¦)
b.) if one needs to know and use several scm tools, one will make more mistakes
using those tools (as you explained in the mail I'm replying toâ€¦)

oh, yes, surely a flamewar helps noone. just to make a good decision one
needs to discuss, and again, best without flamewars! :)

I applaud you for doing so.

quite probably there will always be some with who will not use debhelper,
not use version control, ignore bugs in stable, dont tests their uploads, 
doing foo, but that shouldnt stop everybody else from agreeing on things.

happily noted. also noted that half of the packages you're uploading to main
*are* maintained in git :) (and the other half svnâ€¦ /me likes stats too much :)
