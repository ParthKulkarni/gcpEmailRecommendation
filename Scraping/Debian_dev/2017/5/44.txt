Hi folks,
is it possible to use the substvars mechanism for the *.install and
similar files, just like w/ control file ?
For multi-version installations, I'm keeping the whole package in a
prefix w/ the version number (see my other mail - nodejs). I don't like
to change lots of files which each version number.
thx
