Yeah, for codebases maintained by the service maintainer not having
packages seems reasonable (but not for dependencies of that codebase)
and that seems to be the current feeling within DSA.
Personally I'm leaning towards the feeling that all configuration,
code and dependencies for Debian services should be packaged and
subjected to the usual Debian QA activities but I acknowledge that the
current archive setup (testing migration plus backporting etc) doesn't
necessarily make this easy. The PPA/bikeshed mechanism might make it
more feasible if that happens.

Right.

AFAICT, DSA doesn't have any hard rules/policy written down, just
evaluation on a case-by-case basis.
