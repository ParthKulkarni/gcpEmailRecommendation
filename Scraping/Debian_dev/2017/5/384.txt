It is being done on a per-case basis, isn't it?  Like you described the
libuid versus uuid-runtime?
So, it is not a mass-filing, and it is OK.  Just file the bugs one by
one, with your reasoning, and tag them with usertags if you want to
control them as an unit or something.
A mass-filing for this (the exact oposite of studying each recommends in
a case-by-case basis) _IS_ going to cause imense pushback.  I recommend
against it ;-)
