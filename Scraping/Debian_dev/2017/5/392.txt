  Description     : UPnP Media Server
Gerbera is a UPnP media server, originally based on MediaTomb, which
allows you to stream your digital media through your home network and
consume it on a variety of UPnP compatible devices.
This package is intended to replace MediaTomb which has been abandoned
upstream. I intend to package this as part of the Debian Multimedia  Team.
Thanks,
James
