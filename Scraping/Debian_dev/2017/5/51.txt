I'm afraid Linux on PowerMacs is pretty much dead now.  There is
certainly no-one on the Debian kernel team looking after the powerpc
architecture or PowerMacs.
The only supported Debian release for powerpc is now jessie (wheezy LTS
only covers x86 and ARM; stretch doesn't include powerpc).

This is presumably not an architecture-specific problem, and I seem to
remember seeing it myself at one time.  But it is unlikely to be fixed
in wheezy now.  If the problem still exists in jessie, then please
report the bug against 'src:gnome-bluetooth' (I think that's the right
package) rather than 'general'.
