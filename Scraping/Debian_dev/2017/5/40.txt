  Description     : secure key derivation algorithm from openssl
 EVP_BytesToKey() derives a key and IV from various parameters. type
is the cipher to derive the key and IV for. md is the message digest
to use. The salt parameter is used as a salt in the derivation: it
should point to an 8 byte buffer or NULL if no salt is used. data is a
buffer containing datal bytes which is used to derive the keying data.
count is the iteration count to use. The derived key and IV will be
written to key and iv respectively.
