Disappointing to hear you have ruled out Mailman 3 entirely. I thought that it
looked like a real positive step (especially what little I've seen of
HyperKitty).
I remember filing bugs (with patches) to improve the lists.d.o archives
usability (adding accesskeys, etc. to the mhonarc) over ten years ago and
getting radio silence on the bugs. So even ten years ago, IMHO, the existing
service could use improvements, and that is even more true today.
