  Description     : DBus service for tracking available remote logon servers
 The Remote Logon DBus Service will be part of bringing Arctica Greeter
 (derived from Ubuntu's Unity Greeter) to Debian. The service monitors
 a master broker server (with sub-brokers) and obtains information about
 available remote desktop servers from the brokers. The service is used
 from within Arctica Greeter itself. Arctica Greeter provides a remote
 session logon feature to the user, when remote servers are available.
 .
 History: Around 2012, Canonical Ltd. developed a remote logon feature
 for Unity Greeter that supported FreeRDP logons. Citrix Logons were
 planned, too, but never finished (IIRC). The corresponding components in
 Ubuntu are thin-client-config-agent and remote- login-service.
 .
 The X2Go project (i.e. me) later on provieded patches for X2Go Sessinn
 logon support via Unity Greeter, but those patches never got upstreamed.
 And the UCCS remote logon concept has been discontinued ever since AFAIK.
 .
 The continuation (and improvements) of Unity Greeter's remote logon
 feature will be published under the name Arctica Greeter (i.e., greeter
 frontend for LightDM). As a UCCS-like server, the X2Go Session Broker
 can be used. However, in the Arcitca Project's context, we also plan to
 provide such a brokerage feature which then can be plugged into Arctica
 Greeter.
 .
 The components in Ubuntu are thin-client-config-agent and
 remote-login-service. The forked projects provide the continuation of
 those projects in a completely different name space. Thus, the named
 Ubuntu packages and the forked packages should be co-installable.
 .
 Most of the remote logon code has been contributed by Ted Gould from
 Canonical. Thanks to Ted for this awesome effort on the related
 components.
