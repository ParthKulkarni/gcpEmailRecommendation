  Description     : Parallel Tree Search
 This package is required for bringing KiCS2 to Debian.
 .
 KiCS2 is a new implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language
 Curry. KiCS2 compiles Curry programs into Haskell programs, i.e., it
 uses the Glasgow Haskell Compiler as its backend. Similarly to many
 other implementations of Curry, it also has an interactive environment
 (read/eval/print loop) to ease the development of Curry applications.
 .
 The tree-monad module is maintained upstream by a colleague of mine at
 Kiel university.
 .
 The haskell-tree-monad package will be co-maintained by the maintainer
 team that takes care of Curry related packages in Debian. (Currently,
 that is mainly me as part of my day-time job).
