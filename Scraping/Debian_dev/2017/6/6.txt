Hmm, true.  I misrecalled this detail and failed to check it to be
correct before posting.
We should consider changing that to at least include ALERT as well.

Yes.  I just tested it in Debian stable with "logger -p EMERG
this_is_only_a_test".
It would be far better if KDE used the (!) pictogram at least for ALERT
and EMERG priorities, but it seems to be getting the messages from the
ttys instead of from journald or the syslog daemon.  I did not test this
throughoutly, though.
And yes, I stand corrected. It does not display ALERT or CRIT priorities
by default, only EMERG.  Which is Not Good Enough as far as I am
concerned.

Well, yes.  Remote syslog (wherever deployed) will receive the messages
quasi-real-time, though.  And the messages *are* going to be recorded on
the journal and /var/log/syslog.
Whether someone will read the logs or not, well... it is the same issue
with notifications over local email to root: one has to assume the
system has been properly configured as an Unix workstation (and thus it
has local email routing that goes somewhere it will be read).
I am for doing the three by default: email (for stuff like mdadm),
proper syslog or journald (for everything), and proper desktop-
environment notifications for whomever is logged in.

In the older days, you'd have the messages on the login tty, even if it
screwed up the graphical screen (Solaris and Sun-OS style ;p).
Or you'd have a xconsole window open, even on the xdm screen (which I
never tried to do, I wonder if this was a local xdm change...)
