That's not the complete definition of Recommends. The part you left out
states that there should be a strong, but not absolute dependency.
Presumably their being almost always found together on all but unusual
installations is a consequence of that.

It's not about targeting the maintainer. It's about clarifying what
should be done. I'd be happy to know whether I should have turned the
pbhoney Recommends into a Depends to avoid unwarranted fallback behavior
when people disable Recommends to avoid numerous unneeded packages.
