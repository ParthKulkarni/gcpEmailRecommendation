  Description     : Simple SEG-Y library
segyio is a fairly simple library for reading and writing SEG-Y files
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEG_Y which extensively used geo
sciences.
The library is developed mostly according to our needs, but we'd love to
build a community around embeddable, high quality libraries for geo
sciences. We plan to extend language support beyond python in the
future, once we have a use case for it.
We have received some interest from various parties, and we already
distribute both source code and binaries through pypi
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SegyIO
The libraries are used daily by our scientists and developers.
There are plenty of products that support reading and writing SEG-Y
files, but most are bundled inside huge properietary applications, and
few are fast and usable as libraries.
What's needed is a debian entry, some packaging aid (we'd like to split
the package into its core and its language extensions for Debian
distribution), but we plan to maintain the source code ourselves in
perpetuity. We're of course happy to take patches and to accomodate the
need of distributions.
