  Description     : dehydrated dns-01 challenge response support
 This package provides a hook script to serve dns-01 challenge responses for
 dehydated.
 .
 It uses the dnspython API to perform dynamic DNS updates, creating a temporary
 TXT record for the given domain, thereby proving ownership of the domain.
 It requires a DNS-server capable of performing dynamic DNS updates, like bind9.
 There is no need for the DNS-server to run on the local machine.
 .
 This is especially useful if you want to create ACME certificates for servers
 that do not serve HTTP and/or are not exposed to the public internet.
Most ACME-related packages in Debian only deal with http-01 challenges.
This one deals with dns-01.
I intend to maintain this package under the "Debian Let's Encrypt" umbrella
(provided that the team accepts this :-))
