  Description     : JavaScript Polyfill for ES6 Promise
 Polyfill for the ECMAScript 6 Promise object. Promises allow for ordered
 execution of asynchronous callbacks.
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 This library is a build dependency for webpack. Webpack takes code targeted at
 node.js and adapts it to run in the browser. Node.js comes with an API of
 its own that is not available in browsers. Webpack exposes this code to
 programs that are unaware they are running in a browser.
