I wasn't suggesting they should not be there, it just appears that
maybe something else has superseded them, maybe somebody else can
comment on them or possible alternatives.
For example, if a user is doing this for the first time and they want
to set up a small Debian server to host photos from Shotwell, should
they try Gallery3 or Piwigo from upstream, should either of those be
avoided for any reason, or should they go for something else?

Before opening an upstream feature request, it is important to
understand what possible solutions the community would prefer, that is
why I CC'd debian-devel on this first.
