  Description     : bit array manipulation library
bitfield is a library of functions for creating, modifying and destroying bit
fields (or bit arrays), i.e. series of zeroes and ones spread across an array of
storage units (unsigned long integers).
Bit array is a simple data structure used in a wide range of software (starting
from Linux kernel), yet there is no library that would provide this
functionality, so every package has to reinvent the wheel.
As the author, I would be willing to maintain the Debian package. This is my
first submission, so I would need a sponsor.
