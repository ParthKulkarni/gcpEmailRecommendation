Dear developpers,
With the release of stretch, popularity-contest has reached 200000
submitters, see <http://popcon.debian.org/index.html>.
Some stats:
Reports by architectures:
amd64 submissions: 160428 
i386  submissions: 37979 
others           : 1766
Reports by versions of popcon:
1.46 (lenny)                           : 2925  
1.49 (squeeze)                         : 9600
1.56 (wheezy)                          : 33450
1.61 (jessie)                          : 114427
1.64 (stretch/stable/testing/unstable) : 36640
1.65 (unstable)                        : 785
others: 3131
(Yes there still more submitters running wheezy or squeeze than stretch).
A lot of credit for that go to Peter Palfrader which optimised the
popcon CGI to be able to process that volume of submissions without
choking.
Thanks Peter!
Cheers,
