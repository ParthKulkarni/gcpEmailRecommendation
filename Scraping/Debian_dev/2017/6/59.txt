We have some specific Policy about this:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#s-docs-additional
    If package is a build tool, development tool, command-line tool, or
    library development package, package (or package-dev in the case of a
    library development package) already provides documentation in man,
    info, or plain text format, and package-doc provides HTML or other
    formats, package should declare at most a Suggests on
    package-doc. Otherwise, package should declare at most a Recommends on
    package-doc.
If you feel that this should cap the dependency at Suggests across the
board, feel free to submit a bug against debian-policy.  It seems at least
worth a discussion.  Note that this does tend to make upstreams pretty
unhappy, though, since they get questions from confused Debian users who
don't know how to find the documentation that they're "supposed" to have.
