This thread is about the problem of Recommends bloat.  This bloat
wastes download time and disk space; and it unnecessarily exposes
users to additional risks (of brokenness, and sometimes of security
problems etc.).
It is not usually appropriate to respond to a question "why is this
Recommends" with "why is it a problem for this package to be
installed".

No.  Even if A usually fails without B, Recommends is more appropriate
than Depends if there are plausible ways to use A without B.
It does seem that some maintainers are unclear on these principles, or
their application; despite what seems to me to be very clear wording
in policy.  So I think we need some examples.  To work well they
should have a high profile and be authoritative, so that means taking
a couple of contested cases to the TC.  Maybe #849619 would make a
good test case.
