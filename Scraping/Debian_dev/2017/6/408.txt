sorry, but this had to be said, you are repeating this nonsense. if you 
need
help changing this, try debian-user@lists.debian.org or get paid 
support.
When the average user cannot change the umask, it becomes a higher 
priority that the default umask reflect everyday usage (which is what 
this thread is about--the development of debian and discussing why 
debian still uses a default whose rationale has arguably long past). The 
statement you disparage has bearing on the discussion of the default as 
the discussion is now of more concern considering things like this crop 
up.
Since you brought the issue up: other debian lists provided no help in 
finding a workaround. I don't see you volunteering any info on how to 
workaround the problem. So how do I know it's not impossible? I've 
spoken with another developer elsewhere and he didn't know a fix. But 
the statement you disparage was not asking for a workaround but was a 
comment on the larger user base not having a mechanism for effecting 
this change.
I don't feel your comments were warranted or helpful. The statement you 
disparage is not "nonsense" for the average debian user. I imagine you 
are much more skilled with computers than the average user. I don't want 
my statements to upset or misrepresent and did not intend this. But 
having input from someone who is not a developer per se can be helpful 
and informative to discussions like this.
It strikes me that the community does not care about this issue, that 
the "old" way of doing it is the preferred way even though its original 
rationale has long since passed and is no longer relevant. And 
apparently at least some view me as not knowledgeable enough to be 
discussing this topic with you in this forum considering I do not know 
how to work around the problem myself (but even if I did that would 
still not address the larger subject of this thread).
So signing off. I'll leave my previous emails for the record in the hope 
that they are given consideration by the community. I do appreciate 
having the opportunity to be heard and the feedback received.
