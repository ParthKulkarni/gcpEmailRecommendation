  Description     : Fast fetch and two-way tag synchronization between notmuch and GMail
This program can pull email and labels (and changes to labels) from your GMail account
and store them locally in a maildir with the labels synchronized with a notmuch database.
The changes to tags in the notmuch database may be pushed back remotely to your GMail account.
It will not and can not:
- Add or delete messages on your remote account
- Modify messages other than their labels
PS. I'm not subscribed to -devel, so please do not only reply
there. (I can respond via nntp, but I don't really look at it).
