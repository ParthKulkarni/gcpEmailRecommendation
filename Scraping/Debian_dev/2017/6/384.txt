  Description     : headless server for the game Factorio
Factorio is a massively popular factory management and automation game.
This packages is the headless server used to host dedicated multiplayer
games. Community efforts have so far created distributions for Docker,
Ansible and a number of cloud offerings. I beleive adding a package
for Debian and its derivatives would benefit many users though
easier updates and init system intergration. 
This is my first time creating a package. I intent to the best
of my abilities maintain it myself. It should be simple enough not to
require a comaintainer. I will need a sponsor for the ultimate inclusion 
in the non-free repo games section.
