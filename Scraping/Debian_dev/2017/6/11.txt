I'm wondering if we should give the user more control over Recommends
or Suggests, either by having some kind of blacklist in APT, or introducing
some form of profiles, like build profiles.
Then you could say: By default, do not install .*-doc$ recommends or
do not install recommends in the doc profile. Or do install suggests
in the foobar profile.
