+1 on the texlive packages.
Considering their definitions in d-policy:
```
Recommends:
This declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency. The Recommends
field should list packages that would be found together with this one
in all but unusual installations.
Suggests:
This is used to declare that one package may be more useful with one or
more others. Using this field tells the packaging system and the user
that the listed packages are related to this one and can perhaps
enhance its usefulness, but that installing this one without them is
perfectly reasonable.
```
I fail to understand how -doc packages can qualify for anything else
but Suggests.
