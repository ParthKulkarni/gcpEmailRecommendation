  Description     : A self-service CA for OpenSSH
 OpenSSH supports authentication using SSH certificates.  Certificates
 contain a public key, identity information and are signed with a standard
 SSH key. Cashier is a simple to use self-hosted CA that allows you to easily
 adopt SSH certificates within your organization, providing both a standalone
 web service and also a CLI utility for users to generate certificates locally.
