  Description     : Library/utility for manipulating storage encryption keys and passphrases
  This package provides libvolume_key, a library for manipulating storage volume
  encryption keys and storing them separately from volumes.
  The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted
  hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key
  back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software
  failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the
  company data after an employee leaves abruptly.
This is a build/binary dependency of the ITP'ed libblockdev [1] which in turn
is a new dependency of upcoming udisks [2].
I know that the package names is less than ideal - one usually thinks about
buttons to control the audio volume. If there's demand, I'm okay with changing
the source package name to storage-volume-key, but the binary names need to
(and should) match the upstream library/soname and thus can't be prefixed; so I
don't think it's worth bothering.
If anyone else is interested, co-maintenance is highly welcome and appreciated!
Thanks,
Martin
