I'd like to know why giving the world (Other) read access is even under 
consideration. If user wants a file to have Other readability this 
should be on the user to set it, but it should not be the default.
What is the justification that every user be able to read every other 
user's documents?
This discussion should be on whether to set a default UMASK of 077 or 
027.
NOTE: this discussion is made all the more important currently because 
it seems impossible to set a UMASK at all on Debian Stretch. None of the 
usual ways work within gnome on Debian Stretch. Can anyone comment on 
this fact? How does one get gnome to respect the umask value that's set 
in ~/.profile? Or if not ~/.profile where does one set the default umask 
value for gnome?
