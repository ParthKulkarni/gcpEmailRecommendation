I think we should take a test case or two to the Technical Committee.
Before doing that, it would be wise to try to find the answer to the
key question which the TC will ask.  Suppose A recommends B.  In what
way, or in what circumstances, will A fail due to lack of B ?
In #849619 I don't see the answer to that question.
