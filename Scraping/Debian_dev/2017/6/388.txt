The Intel Pentium D is a very old processor, and its hyper-threading is
very different from the recent processors.  It cannot be the same
defect.

We do ship some public microcode updates for several Pentium D
processors, but they're really old updates.  There is no guarantee that
they will fix your issue.
Note that it could be a problem elsewhere.  Those are old processors, in
old motherboards, with old system components (memory, power supplies,
etc).  And the current software (kernel, etc) is not often tested on
them anymore, so it could be a software problem, too.
If you want to try, please install intel-microcode as described in
https://wiki.debian.org/Microcode
Pentium D specification updates ("defect list"):
