  Description     : Python3 asyncio based SMTP server
This is a server for SMTP and related protocols, similar in utility to
the standard library’s smtpd.py module, but rewritten to be based on
asyncio for Python 3.
This package is a new dependency for mailman3-core package that I first
intended to package in sept. 2015[1]. Since then, we decided to wait
until Mailman 3.1 to finalize packaging as python3.5 became the main
version of python in debian and mailman3.0.x was not fully 3.5
operative.
Now that 3.1 is out, it's time to finish this work, and this package
seems to be the only missing dependency.
This package would be maintained by me and the DPMT. Barry Warsaw
offered to sponsor me on this one.
Cheers.
