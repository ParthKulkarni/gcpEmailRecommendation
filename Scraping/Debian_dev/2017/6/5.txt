Only LOG_EMERG does that, at least on my machine and I'm pretty sure

Running KDE here, so familiar with them. The first problem with those is 
they automatically vanish after a few seconds. They remain around, if 
you pull up the alert notifier, but that little (1) in the systray is 
easy to miss.
Second problem is that only works if you're logged in. Even on a typical 
desktop where the main user is the admin, it's not safe to assume a that 
user will always be logged in:
Third problem, syslog imposes some pretty severe format restrictions on 
the message. An alert sent via email can have a lot more details & 
instructions than a syslog message.
Using a machine as a home media server (e.g., a NAS) is a reasonably 
common thing tooâ€”then it'll hardly ever have a local logged in user.
You can surely configure rsyslog to get that alert to you anyway. 
(Probably using ommail!). But that's no easier than configuring outgoing 
email.****
