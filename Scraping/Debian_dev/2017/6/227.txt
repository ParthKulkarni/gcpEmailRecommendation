Thanks for the explanation.
When I saw in the gcc thread that there's only one distribution not supporting
lzip, I wanted to know more. Now, thanks to your explanations, I know more
about this topic.

I think lzip is presently quite (maybe not “very”) wide spread. I wish that
when the moment lzip has enough use comes, you will make a decision
and will support lzip.
