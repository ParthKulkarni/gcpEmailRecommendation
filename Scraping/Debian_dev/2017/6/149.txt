Description     : Clean-up and beautify the list of minor-modes in Emacs' mode-line
 Rich-minority-mode is used for hiding and/or highlighting the list of
 minor-modes in the mode-line.
 .
 By default, it has a couple of small effects (provided as examples).
 These can be customised by modifying the following three variables:
 .
 rm-blacklist: List of minor mode names that will be hidden from the
 minor-modes list. Use this to hide only a few modes that are always
 active and don’t really contribute information.
 .
 rm-whitelist: List of minor mode names that are allowed on the
 minor-modes list. Use this to hide all but a few modes.
 .
 rm-text-properties: List text properties to apply to each minor-mode
 lighter. For instance, by default Ovwrt is highlighted with a red
 face, so you always know if you’re in overwrite-mode.
I'm not a fan of the upstream name "rich-minority", but this package
is a dependency for elpa-smart-mode-line.  The name seems to be a pun
on rich text (eg: coloured) support for the mode line.  I would
maintain it as part of the pkg-emacsen team and will require a sponsor.
Sincerely,
Nicholas
