  Description     : Graphical application for generating different 
color variations of Numix theme (GTK2, GTK3) and gnome-colors icon theme.
This package allows people to customize the GTK+ theme, and is based on 
the Numix theme. It is a substitute of gnome-color-chooser that is 
deprecated (only for GTK+2).
This program is useful for people that want to create a new GTK+ theme 
and is useful for low-vision people that needs to change the contrast of 
the default theme.
Best regards.
