Why is that question relevant?  The policy definition of Recommends (versus 
Suggests) has nothing to with if there will be a failure or not:

Personally, I think the maintainer articulated what he views as the usual 
situation and declines to remove Recommends that are, in the maintainer's 
view, appropriate.  His rationale makes complete sense to me.  I'm not saying 
there aren't other, reasonable choices that could be made, but it make sense.  
I don't think this is the kind of thing the TC should even entertain 
overruling a maintainer on.
For things like this, get consensus on a new definition for Recommends first 
as this looks to me to be well within the scope of the current definition.  
Not even close.
