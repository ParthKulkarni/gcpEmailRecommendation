Package: general
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
It seemed after I installed 8.8-Jessie-upgraded packages on my 8.7.1 Jessie on
my PowerMac G5 the graphics were reset.
However, UNFORTUNATELY :((((......I needed to use an ATI graphics card to get
my screen working prior to the upgrade. So when it rebooted, the GPU was reset
according to the ATI card. :(!
I would please like another GPU reset now that my 6800 Geforce (nvidia) Ultra
AGP card is in there now....maybe to save the fuss you could please instruct me
the "secret sauce" for doing it myself? I'm open to building .debs from source,
coding in assembly, coding in C, recompiling a kernel, etc.
I originally requested the GPU reset in the new OS-wide version number because
my screen real estate was shrunken but otherwise perfectly fine (i.e. there was
black space on part of the screen) and the gfx chip probably just needed a re-
flash/reset.
Thanks a (large) bunch.
