Hi Marco Bardelli,
Are you still packaging dj-database-url for
Debian ?
I put dj-database-url on Debian some days ago as 
a NEW package and today, I was doing the repository for
it. But the repository already exists. And your name is the 
last one that did a 'git push'. You can check here[0]:
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/dj-database-url.git/
How is the situation nowadays? The package I did was
accepted[1], but maybe it already exists on Debian.

Can I use the repository ?
Regards,
Herbert
