Package: general
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***
   * What led up to the situation?
I have many custom keyboard combination
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
After the Debian upgrade some of my combinations are not working anymore such as:
Open the file manager: SuperKey + E
Lock Screen: Ctrl+Alt+L
Open Terminal: F12
I've tried with other combinations than they work but looks like there are some issues.
/var/logs/messages shows this:
 gnome-settings-[2285]: Could not find accelerator for accel id 138
 gnome-settings-[2285]: Could not find accelerator for accel id 138
   * What was the outcome of this action?
Nothing works
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
Do what it is supposed to do
