Looking at Shotwell in stretch, in the Plugins tab of the Preferences
dialog, I see there are extra options now:
* Gallery3[1] (although it is not maintained upstream any more), there
is an RFP[2] for Debian packaging.
* Piwigo[3], which was removed[4] from Debian in 2012
Sadly neither of those is currently in Debian.
Does anybody consider them a viable solution or would it be desirable
for Shotwell to support another alternative for people who don't want
Debian to promote Facebook?
Regards,
Daniel
