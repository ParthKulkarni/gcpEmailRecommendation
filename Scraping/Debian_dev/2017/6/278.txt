  Description     : C library to read HRTFs stored in the AES69-2015 SOFA format
 Libmysofa is a light weight C-library intended to read SOFA (Spatially Oriented
 Format for Acoustics) files for spatial rendering.
 It hardly has any library dependencies and is suitable for embedded devices.
 .
 It reads SOFA files and checks whether the data complies to the
 "SimpleFreeFieldHRIR" conventions. In addition, it provides functions to
 look-up and interpolate the filters for a given orientation and to normalize
 the HRTFs (Head-Related Transfer Functions) to a reference level.
apart from their general usefulness (for the spatial audio community), ffmpeg
and vlc recently switched to libmysofa for reading SOFA-files, it might be a
good idea to have these dependencies in Debian.
I intend to maintain libmysofa under the pkg-multimedia umbrella.
