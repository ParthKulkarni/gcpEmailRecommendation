Feel free to do that on your systems - just change the location of the
home directory for root in /etc/passwd. The default on GNU/Linux
systems has been /root for many years, and I don't see it
changing. This is already different from some older Unix tradition -
some systems simply used / for the root user home directory too, but
thankfully that died a long time ago.
