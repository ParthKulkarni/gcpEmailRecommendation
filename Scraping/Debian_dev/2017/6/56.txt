The printer-driver-all package uses Recommends, but its source package also 
builds the printer-driver-all-enforce alternative package that has the same 
relations but as Depends. As britney only checks for Depends when verifying 
migration requirements, this setup makes sure that the printer-driver-all 
package only ever migrates if all its Recommends are satisfied. the -enforce 
alternative is not meant to be used by end-users.
