I completely agree. I've teken issue with packages recommending packages
in the spirit of "if you want this, you might also want X", which is the
literal sense of the word "recommends", but fits the definition in
policy for Suggests ("package may be more useful with one or more
others"). I've been unsuccessful in arguing this case before (#849619),
so I don't think the bug-filing method previously suggested [1] will
work. I think there needs to be a clarification to everyone of what
Recommends is for, since there seem to be different interpretations
(although the policy looks quite clear to me).
I see this as a real problem for cases where a Recommends is actually
important. As an example, I have a package pbhoney that Recommends
pbdagcon. If pbdagcon is not installed, pbhoney has a fallback
implementation that is not as good. So it is highly preferable to have
pbdagcon installed if it is available, but you can still use pbhoney
without it--although it will not run as well. I see that this perfectly
fits the definition of Recoomends ("a strong, but not absolute,
dependency"). but if people go on and globally use
--no-install-recommends, there may be an unnecessarily negative
consequence here.
