	Actually, no, ‚Äútransitively bad‚Äù above seems like a correct
	assessment.
	While I dislike adding any more complexity to APT dependencies,
	can there perhaps be a separate Recommends-If-Manual: list of
	packages to only be installed when the depending package is
	marked as manually installed (as per apt-mark(8); and when
	recommended packages are otherwise considered for installing, as
	per APT::Install-Recommends)?
	To ensure backward compatibility, this condition would have to
	also apply for the packages also in the Recommends: list.
	Moreover, for one release cycle, any packages with
	Recommends-If-Manual: would have to have that same dependencies
	duplicated in Recommends: as well.
