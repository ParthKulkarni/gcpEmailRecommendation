(and I thought it was still open).
To clarify and close this tangent...
nmap (bug 714320 open) "dep" on liblinear1 (bug 682062 closed)
Looking solely at the package pages themselves,
I did not intend to drag the conversation off topic.  It was merely an 
attempt to demonstrate the daisy chain effect of bloat.  How a new 
dependency in a CLI tool could daisy chain an install of X11.
stretch/nmap (7.40-1)  ---> dep: liblinear3 (>= 2.01+dfsg) ---> sug: 
liblinear-tools (= 2.1.0+dfsg-2)
jessie/nmap (6.47-3+deb8u2) ---> dep: jessie/liblinear1 (>= 1.6) ---> 
sug: wheezy/liblinear-tools (= 1.8+dfsg-4)
wheezy/nmap (6.00-0.3+deb7u1) ---> dep: wheezy/liblinear1 (>= 1.6)  --- 
rec: wheezy/liblinear-tools (= 1.8+dfsg-1)
The bug only seems to persist in wheezy.  On a freshly built machine 
using debian-stretch-DI-rc4-amd64-i386-netinst.iso, the problem no 
longer persists for me.
