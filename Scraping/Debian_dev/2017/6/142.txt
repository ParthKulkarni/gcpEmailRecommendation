Since writing this I've thought of another usecase, where next/foo
branches complement pull requests.
Someone might contribute a fix in the form of a PR, and an uploader of
the package might review that fix and determine that it should be
merged.  They then look at the master branch and decide that it should
not go into the next upload, for whatever reason.  So they can merge the
PR to next/sid.
This is useful because it avoids accidentally reviewing the patch twice.
