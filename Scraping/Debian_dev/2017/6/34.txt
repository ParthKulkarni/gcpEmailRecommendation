It is remarkable that out of 94 unsatisfied recommends on my system you
disagreed with just 6, despite them going contrary to the maintainer's
wishes thus being certain to be controversial.
Also, it's quite obvious this list was very hastily done, with often just a
few seconds per entry.  Thus, I admit the list does contain inaccuracies
that fail when confronted with a bit more research.  The intent is just to
have a sample -- not to file actual bugs yet.

I do use lxc quite heavily, usually choosing IP addresses within config
files but sometimes using DHCP.  And it seems to work just fine without
dnsmasq -- thus, unless I'm missing something, it's not something that
"would be found together [...] in all but unusual installations".

906kB is bigger than most of Recommends on this list, but as not a part of
the default install you do have a point that it may make it easier to have
pre-installed: while it's a common setup to store a lxc host on a separate
small filesystem, typical lxc boxes aren't on the small side overall.
I'm not persuaded about the importance of this add-on, but that's exactly
why we're having this debate.
The point of a debate is not to "win" but to find the best solution...

I did not happen to know ghostscript can also be used not for .ps but also
for some .pdf workflows (I prefer to not use blatantly fake-free software)
but my main point stands: an _image_ manipulation program cannot be said to
import _documents_ in "all but unusual installations".
And "gsfonts" is not even ghostscript itself but merely an add-on for it.

There's gnome-screensaver, which has better integration with Gnome at the
cost of using a ton of gnome-related bloat (which doesn't hurt a Gnome user
in any way -- they already have that installed).  Thus, a _typical_ Gnome
user won't install xscreensaver, and a typical xscreensaver user won't
install Gnome.  And "Recommends:" is all about typical use.
Plus, as Simon McVittie mentioned, libgnomeui-0 is strongly deprecated even
within Gnome itself.

I'm not dealing with any po-heavy packages at the moment, yeah.  It might
indeed be useful for some deep po stuff, but the package I want is
"debhelper".  Technically, I do know how to package without debhelper (see
"goodbye") but I still would prefer to use it.  And as someone involved in
both QA and sponsoring -- thus dealing with hundreds of packages -- I have
yet to use podebconf-report-po once.  Thus, it's quite hard to say that
debhelper and libmail-sendmail-perl "would be found together in all but
unusual installations".

Let's not waste too much time right now, but if I recall that discussion
correctly, the sane way would be to have a non-systemd alternative _first_:
on a systemd install, the second alternative would be already present and
thus satisfy the dependency, while the first one would avoid imposing
systemd when not wanted.

Nope, its contents are four misc "extra utilities" that are mean to run _by
the user_ or at most by some scripts.  They look somewhat useful
(purple-remote allows controlling pidgin from cmdline, etc) but are
seriously hampered by a lack of documentation.  On the other hand, not a
single one is ever called by the library:
strings `dpkg -L libpurple0`|grep purple-remote
strings `dpkg -L libpurple0`|grep purple-send
strings `dpkg -L libpurple0`|grep purple-send-async
strings `dpkg -L libpurple0`|grep purple-url-handler
As for your claim that "like all other lib*-bin packages in Debian", let's
check the rest on my list:
libpng-bin: usr/bin/png-fix-itxt usr/bin/pngfix
libwmf-bin: usr/bin/wmf2{eps,fig,gd,svg,x}
strings `dpkg -L libwacom2`|grep libwacom-list-local-devices

Uhm... could you be please be a bit more civil?  Especially when making
statements that are easily debunked (like the bit about "packaging
conventions" of lib*-bin above).  Somehow, neither Jonas nor Tom used a
single angry word.  And, their responses were informative even when I'm
disagreeing with them.

That we're having another repeat of this thread, and that people tend to use
--no-install-recommends despite that being supposed to be exceptional, says
otherwise.

The issue is systematic, and we have far more than "a few" cases.  The very
post you're responding to had 94 of them, and my desktop has only a small
slice of packages in Debian installed -- and I looked at Recommends I have
currently unfulfilled, there's far more where I either did not have the time
to micromanage or have package B installed not because of Recommends from A
but because of a dependency from C.

TC would be an appropriate venue for a conflict with a _single_ maintainer,
which is not the case here.
