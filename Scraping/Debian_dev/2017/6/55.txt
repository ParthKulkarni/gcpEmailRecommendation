It does (xserver-xorg-video-all, xserver-xorg-input-all); there's also 
va-driver-all, vdpau-driver-all (two video-acceleration interfaces) and 
printer-driver-all.  We are considering introducing opencl-icd-all.
However, those involve Depends relationships (where an -all package is 
needed to allow the option of only installing one) and/or multiple 
depending/recommending packages and a changing set of providers (making 
it desirable to be able to make such changes in one central place). 
Hence, I agree that it wouldn't be worth it for *-microcode.
There's also the AppStream modalias mechanism, which can actually pick 
the right one for the current hardware, but the tools that process it 
aren't always installed:
