 This is a modern tool to assist in network address calculations for
 IPv4 and IPv6. It acts both as a tool to output human readable
 information about a network or address, as well as a tool suitable to
 be used by scripts or other programs.
 .
 It supports printing a summary about the provided network address,
 multiple command line options per information to be printed,
 transparent IPv6 support, and in addition it will use libGeoIP if
 available to provide geographic information.
I'm an intense user of ipcalc, which is a really useful tool, but ipcalc
does not do IPv6 addresses. I've stumbled over the ipcalc by Nikos
Mavrogiannopoulos when looking for a version that is IPv6 capable. I'm
aware of the naming collision, thats why i propose to call the package
(and the binary) ipcalng. I'm not sure yet if that name is the right
solution, in particular because in fedora the perl ipcalc version was
renamed to ipcalculator and this one is now called ipcalc [0]. This
could lead to a lot of confusion and i would have to maintain that
change forever. If there are better solutions please let me know.
cheers,
muri
