I'm inferring from this that you have the DP+ with 8 RAM slots, and you
have upgraded from 4 * 1 GiB to 8 * 1 GiB installed.  Is that right?

This is quite surprising.  It is normal for the system firmware to
reserve some amount of memory that is then unavailable to Linux, but
this is a very large amount.
Please also send the kernel boot messages, which might help explain
what's going on.  (We probably still won't be able to solve this,
though, as there are few developers still interested in PowerMac
systems.)
