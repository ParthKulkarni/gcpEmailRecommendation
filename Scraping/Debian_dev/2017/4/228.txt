That was my first thought, too. But then I realized you need operators for:
- increasing, like above
- decreasing like for vm.swappiness
- handling "booleans" and tri-states as used by several security features
  granted, this is mostly as increasing
And you obviously get into funny situations when different files mandate
different change directions.
