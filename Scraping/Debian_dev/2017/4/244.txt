I've never even tried to dist-upgrade RHEL but I have dist-upgraded
RHL and Fedora. It was/is perfectly do-able but they both had/have
shorter release cycles.
IF Red Hat had felt that there was a market for dist-upgrade support,
it could have offered it for a extra fee, just like it offers an
extended support subscription for companies that want to stick to want
to stick to a release beyond the standard EOL or to a minor release.
It does offer an *unsupported* upgrade via anaconda.
