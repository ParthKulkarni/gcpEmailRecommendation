archive.d.n is only for obsolete releases so you should normally not
be accessing it, please use packages.debian.org instead:
https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libc6
For the cert issue, please contact the maintainer of the service:
Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>
Reporting a general bug is not the right way to get this fixed.
