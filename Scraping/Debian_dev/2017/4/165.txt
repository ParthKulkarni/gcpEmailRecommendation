Other Info
--------------
I am a Debian Maintainer and I have packaged this for the pkg-gnome
team. The packaging is derived from the mozjs24 package. Packaging is
at
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-gnome/mozjs38.git/
mozjs38 is required for GNOME 3.24 (particularly gjs and gnome-shell)
The gjs developer intends to port gjs to mozjs45 and maybe mozjs52
(the current version) for GNOME 3.26 later this year.
Besides GNOME, there are 3 Debian packages that use mozjs24 (edbrowse
and Cinnamon with its gjs fork, cjs). Both upstreams are working on
porting to mozjs38 now.
Thanks,
Jeremy Bicha
