Just for the Google record, someone mailed me privately (apparently
something went wrong with getting mail sent to the list) to point out that
this lack of an upgrade path between RHEL versions was a one-time thing
for one specific RHEL version transition, and RHEL does indeed support
in-place upgrades for support customers for subsequent releases (and has
tools and whatnot to help determine if anything will break).
