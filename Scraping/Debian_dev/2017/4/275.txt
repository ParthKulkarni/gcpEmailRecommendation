  Description     : An HTTP and DNS demultiplexer
hddemux listens on a stream and routes incoming clients to either an
HTTP backend or a DNS stream-based backend depending on the first
request to appear on the stream.
This is useful when making DNS-over-TLS (RFC 7858) connections that
appear to the network be HTTPS connections, for example, which makes
it easier to traverse a network that would prefer to block the user
from making DNS-over-TLS queries.
