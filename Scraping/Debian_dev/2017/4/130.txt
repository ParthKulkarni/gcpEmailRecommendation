Yes, you're right of course. I was thinking of a specific example (don't
remember which one anymore) where the word was *written* with an H at
the start, but the H was not pronounced; I just wrote it down
incorrectly.

Yup, indeed, that's the one.
The sillyness about this is that you're making rules about *writing*
something that depend on something that has *nothing* to do with
actually writing things.
Do you write "An RTC server" or "A RTC server"? Well, that depends on
whether you say "An arr-tee-cee" or "A real-time communication". It's
horrible as a rule.

Free (introduction to) Dutch lessons, too!
