  Description     : X.org input driver for tslib
xf86-input-tslib had been in Debian before, see
https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/xf86-input-tslib and I'm rewriting the
packaging completely due to it's age. I only intend to build upon the
old changelog file.
Former upstream site:
http://public.pengutronix.de/software/xf86-input-tslib/
Packaging is done here now:
https://github.com/merge/xf86-input-tslib-debian
 - why is this package useful/relevant?
tslib is still quite widely used in embedded at least. It saw much
improvements recently and this package would make tslib available to
X servers. xf86-input-tslib 0.0.7 was recently released and makes it
usable on recent systems. There are plans for multitouch too.
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
I reached out to the people from the old packaging repo at
http://git.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/xf86-input-tslib.git;a=summary
but haven't heard anything. It shouldn't be an issue though, to just
maintain this little packaging code on github.
