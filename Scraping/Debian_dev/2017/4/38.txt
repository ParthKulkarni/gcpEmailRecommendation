Hi Russel.  Our mail servers seem to be fighting.  Could you contact
me at
   postmaster@chiark.greenend.org.u  (bypasses spamfilter)
   hqon7c@fyvzl.net                  (bypasses spamfilter even more)
   irc: Diziet on oftc or freenode
The complaint from your MTA is that you can't mail postmaster@chiark.
If true, that would be a bug, and I would like more information so I
can fix it.
I tried to mail postmaster@stuart but it bounced - see below.
Thanks,
Ian.
