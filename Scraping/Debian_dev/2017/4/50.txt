Thanks for this reply.  I tried
    keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
    keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg
    keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg
    keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-nonupload.gpg
    keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-role-keys.gpg
    primary-keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
But then I get errors like this:
    gpg: keyblock resource '/home/spwhitton/.gnupg/pubring.kbx': File exists
which I don't understand.

Good point that this avoids the write errors.  The problem is that
you're going to need to keep the keys of all keyring-maint members
updated out-of-band, in order to verify sha256sums.txt, but effortlessly
keeping track of DD keys was the whole point of all this.
