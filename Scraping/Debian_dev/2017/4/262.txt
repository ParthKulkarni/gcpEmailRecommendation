In real world, this means you end up with RHEL servers all over the place
that lost their security support a decade ago.  I on the other hand have a
potato install (currently in a lxc container but still doing its work) and a
testing/sarge install still in mostly-original machine, already on stretch.
Reinstalling everything on a server is costly, thus it's no surprise it's
postponed indefinitely while that server appears to work fine.
No conffile handling is a smaller version of this: you either leave the old,
wrong and likely insecure config untouched, or need to rewrite it from
scratch.  That's hardly better than reinstalling.
The only "benefit" I see is that the RPM way is less work for the
maintainer.

On the other hand, corpo lager is not a race.
