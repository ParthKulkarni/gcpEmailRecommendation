  Description     : Emacs mode to display ugly ^L page breaks as tidy horizontal lines
      This library provides an Emacs mode which displays form feed
      characters as horizontal rules.
      .
      The U+000C FORM FEED character is a normal white-space character, and
      in a text file is often used to mark virtual “page” separation.
      .
      Though it is rendered invisibly as white space, Emacs will (like many
      text editors) represent it with a glyph such as “^L”. This Emacs mode
      allows the same character to instead display as a custom horizontal
      line.
I have found this package useful and would like to make it available
in Debian. If the Debian Emacs addons team are willing, this could be
maintained there, otherwise I will maintain it myself.
