  Description     : Large Time-Frequency Toolbox (LTFAT) in Python
Long-Description:
 The ltfatpy package is a partial Python port of the Large
 Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT), a MATLABÂ®/Octave toolbox
 for working with time-frequency analysis and synthesis.
 .
 It is intended both as an educational and a computational tool.
 .
 The package provides a large number of linear transforms including
 Gabor transforms along with routines for constructing windows (filter
 prototypes) and routines for manipulating coefficients.
This package will be co-maintained by the Debian Science Team.
