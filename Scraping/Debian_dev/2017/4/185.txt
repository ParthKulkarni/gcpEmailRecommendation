  Description     : Node's domain module for the web browser
 “Node's domain module for the web browser. This is merely an evented
try...catch with the same API as node, nothing more.”.
 .
 This library is a dependency for browserify and webpack. Browserify/Webpack
 takes code targeted at node.js and makes it  run in the browser. Node.js comes
 with API of its own that is not available in the browsers. Browserify/Webpack
 exposes this code to programs that are unaware they are running in a browser.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 It will be maintained in pkg-javascript team on alioth.
 Praveen has agreed to sponsor this package.
