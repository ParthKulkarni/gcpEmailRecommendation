  Description     : a library of C functions for biological sequence analysis
 Easel is an ANSI C code library for computational analysis of
 biological sequences using probabilistic models. Easel is used by
 HMMER, the profile hidden Markov model software that underlies the
 Pfam protein families database, and by Infernal, the profile
 stochastic context-free grammar software that underlies the Rfam RNA
 family database. Easel aims to make similar applications more robust
 and easier to develop, by providing a set of reusable, documented, and
 well-tested functions.
Several existing packages contain code copies and it is high time this and the example
apps were seperately packaged.
