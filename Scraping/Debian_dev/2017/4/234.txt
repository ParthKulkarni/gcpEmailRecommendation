And:
- inconsistent with every package in Debian not in that particular stack
- hard for admins to make edits (one needs to guess this particular scheme
  is in place and find the file to modify)
- failure to do configuration upgrades; in some cases this can result in
  serious security issues
- fails whenever the files in /usr are rearranged
- can't be managed sanely with usual configuration management systems
  (including raw git)
- makes the history of changes done by you vs the package (on a
  non-overridden file) hard to audit
All of this is caused by Red Hat having no support for upgrades:
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/21964
# Red Hat does not support in-place upgrades between major versions 4, 5 and
# 6 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  (A major version is denoted by a whole
# number version change.  For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red
# Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are both major versions of Red Hat Enterprise
# Linux).
#
# In-place upgrades across major releases do not preserve all system
# settings, services or custom configurations.  Consequently, Red Hat
# strongly recommends fresh installations when upgrading from one major
# version to another.
# Red Hat currently supports only upgrades from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
# to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for specific/targeted use cases only.
On the other hand, being able to effortlessly dist-upgrade is one of biggest
reasons many of us have chosen Debian.
Thus, what about we stop digging the hole and at least forbid this scheme
for new packages?

If all your boxes are identical and get their snowflake number from the net,
/etc can come from the same place /var and /usr does.  You do need to
ensure the rest is unmodified anyway.  Shoving things under the carpet
doesn't help.

But beside the maintainer hat, do you wear a sysadmin hat sometimes?
