  Description     : Simple interactive astronomical image examination and plotting
 Imexam is an affiliated package of AstroPy. It was designed to be a
 lightweight library which enables users to explore data using common
 methods which are consistent across viewers. It can be used from a
 command line interface, through a Jupyter notebook or through a
 Jupyter console. It can be used with multiple viewers, such as DS9 or
 Ginga, or without a viewer as a simple library to make plots and grab
 quick photometry information.
The package will be maintained by the Debian Astro team. It is part of
the effort to package astropy affiliated packages.
A git repository will be created at
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-astro/packages/imexam.git
