  Description     : grammatical corrector for libreoffice and firefox
Grammalecte is an open source grammar checker made for the french
language, with extensions for Write (LibreOffice, OpenOffice) and
Firefox. It is derived from Lightproof, which was written for
hungarian.
Grammalecte helps writing in french without bothering users with false
alarms. This checker therefore follows the principle of least "false
positives"; if it's impossible to determine with a strong probability
that a string is erroneous, the checker won't signal anything.
----
Grammalecte is the first checker I have found that does extensive
grammar checks for french while at the same time being a) actively
developped and b) free software.
I am not using it yet, being mostly restricted to english in most of
my public writing, but I hope to go back to french more, in which case
I will test it extensively and may end up packaging it myself.
It's an unofficial fork of "Lightproof", which seems mostly inactive,
but was written by FSF.hu for Hungarian and has LibreOffice extensions
as well:

It's unclear if they plan to merge back together.
Someone discussed maintaining this in Debian 3 years ago on their
forum:

I'll post this WNPP there as soon as I have a bug #.
I usually maintain my packages in collab-maint and this one is no
exception. I'd also be happy to delegate this to someone else and just
sponsor the package or do whatever is needed to get this in...
