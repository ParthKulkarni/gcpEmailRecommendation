Please note that the current sysctl interface doesn't play well with
network interfaces that get created on the fly, such as bonding, VLAN
interfaces or bridges. One needs to first initialize the network, then
do the sysctl business to catch those interfaces, to catch even the
dynamically created interfaces.
Or it was the other way round. I remember going through bizarre
contortions to set IPv6 ip_forwarding on jessie without
systemd-networkd supporting this "exotic" use case.
