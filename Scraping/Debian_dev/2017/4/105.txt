  Description     : static C++ library for loading XDF (multi-channel stream format) files
Libxdf is a cross-platform C++ library for loading multimodal,
multi-rate signals stored in XDF files. Libxdf is a core component of
bio-signal viewing application SigViewer. It can also be integrated into
other C++ applications.
The last release is just a few days old.
This is a new dependency of the sigviewer package that needs an update
to version 0.6 (#860083)
This package will be maintained by the NeuroDebian team.
At the moment upstream does not support building a shared library.
