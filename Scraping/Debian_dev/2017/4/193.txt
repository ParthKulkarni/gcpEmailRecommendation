Sorry for not replying to your earlier mail. I just now realized you
"dropped" the bug report address and you were communicating only with
me.
The problem you describe is mostly mappable to failed expetations in
the user interface - You expect the file manager to do one thing, but
something else happens.
As to why the disk gets full - Well, even without knowing them, I can
only "blame" it on your programs.
I am marking this bug report as unreproducible and closing it; of
course, feel free to reopen it in case you feel it's the wrong action.
