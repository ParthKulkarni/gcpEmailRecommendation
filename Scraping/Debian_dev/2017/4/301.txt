  Description     : create hashes for browserify
 This package allow one to create hash in browser context using
 Node.js API.
 .
 A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size
 to data of fixed  size. Hash functions are related to checksums, check digits,
 fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions,
error-correcting codes,
 and ciphers. Although these concepts overlap to some extent, each has
its own uses and   requirements and is designed and optimized
differently.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
