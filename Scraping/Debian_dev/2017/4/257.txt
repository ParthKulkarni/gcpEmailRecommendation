Yes, I am aware of that (many of my customers use RedHat systems).
However, you will notice the complete absense of a "merge" option in the
above. This means that new configuration files are dropped on the
system, *without* any active notification to the user, so it's up to you
to figure out that this has happened and that you may have work to do.
I didn't say RPM *doesn't* deal with changed files; I said ours deals
with it better. I stand by that.
