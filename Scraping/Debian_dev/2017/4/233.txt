While this scheme was probably instigated by limitations in RPM, at this 
point we have had multiple packages (kmod, systemd, udev for a start) 
using it for years.
Moving the sysctl.d default settings to /etc would be:
- a waste of developers time
- a gratuitous incompatibility with other distributions
- inconsistent with the documentation both inside and outside Debian
- inconsistent with other configuration files implementing this scheme

There are also good arguments for having the whole default configuration 
live in /usr and only local changes in /etc: e.g. this allows supporting 
systems with an empty /etc, which greatly reduces the administrative 
time needed to manage a large number of servers/containers.

In my experience as the maintainer of the packages which introduced this 
scheme this has not been a noticeable problem.
