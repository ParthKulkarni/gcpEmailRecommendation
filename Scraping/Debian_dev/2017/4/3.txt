I noticed one request for binary diffs (I assume a la debdelta) with an
explicit mention of it being upstreamed to Debian[1].

"""
- FLAVOR: Ubuntu Any (preferred this to be in upstream Debian)
- HEADLINE: binary diff updates for apt-get.
- DESCRIPTION:
I have seen Fedora updates as binary diffs. It is very small, uses
less bandwidth and space, and gets installed faster.
This request isn't really for Ubuntu 17.10 though (I don't know if
there is enough time for this). And I don't wish (actually I hate)
this to be an Ubuntu specific feature. I wish this to be an upstream
(Debian) feature.
Thanks
