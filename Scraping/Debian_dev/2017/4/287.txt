  Description     : Poetry writing aids for Emacs
In combination with tools such as dict.el, and thesaurus.el, this
package extends Emacs to make it easier to write metrically
correct poetry with more varied diction.  Its four primary functions
are:
 
1. A poetry-mode that shows the foot count for each line in the left
   margin. Use M-x poetry-mode to turn it on or off.
2. A way to get (some) rhymes. Put the cursor on a word and then M-x
   poetry-rhyme-word. Assign a key combination to this if you use it
   frequently. This uses the internal dictionary from the 'rhyme'
   package.
3. A way to get rhymes from the following websites via:
   * M-x poetry-rhyme-word-rhymezone
   * M-x poetry-rhyme-word-rhymer
   * M-x poetry-rhyme-word-wikirhymer
   * M-x poetry-rhyme-word-primerhyme
   * M-x poetry-rhyme-word-brhymes
4. A way to display verse form templates in the left margin. This
   coexists nicely with the foot count but either can be used
   independently. M-x poetry-form and select the form from the
   list. C-x 0 to get rid of the display.
    
Formal poetry tends to be seen as something mysterious and difficult.
This package allows someone who is still having difficulty scanning
lines--that is to say, difficulty finding and/or counting the stressed
and unstressed syllables--the chance to build confidence by succeeding
in these early steps.
I had planned to upload it to pkg-emacsen, because the package is
closer to a "spellcheck for meter" than to "software that teaches you
to write poetry", where DebianEdu would be more appropriate.
Upstream status is currently alpha, so I plan to upload to
experimental until I've spent enough time with it.
