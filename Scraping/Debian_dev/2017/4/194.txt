Hi Wolf
Thank you for replying and for being helpful.
I wrote a batch of perl programs to deal with the emails returned to me.
Everyday I send emails marketing a book I had written. The perl program I sent
to you in attachment do the parsing of the files related to the emails
returned to me. The emails are previously saved  in a directory. The perl
program analyses the return codes of emails, and accordingly, the email
addresses are written in different files (a file with the email addresses
considered spam; a file with email addresses considered unknown; a file with
new email addresses, etc). The program also analyses the returning emails like
"out of office". After that, another perl program includes the treated email
addresses in a small (kind of) data base.
Let's go to the reported bug. As I told you, I use the last release of debian
Jessie, with Xfce. Previously, the perl programs were executable ones.
Sometimes, in the file manager Thunar 1.6.3 I click two times in a perl
program (executable) in order to open it with the gedit text editor, but
instead to open it, I mistakenly  execute it. It happens that the
xfce4-terminal (0.6.3) don't open to show the output. Due to these actions, I
think the disk became full several times, creating a lot of trouble.
Since I marked the perl files as not executable, when I click two times on a
perl file, it opens automatically gedit text editor, presenting the respective
perl file. This way, the double click do not start the execution of the
program. When I intend to run the perl program (file), I open a
xfce4-terminal, and write: perl name_of_perl_program. Since then I had any
problem.
In Wheezy I got disk full a lot of times. In Jessie, it happen to me one time.
I managed to free some disk, I restarted the computer, and I got 30% of disk
usage instead of 100%. I think Jessie managed to recover nicely from this kind
of error. On the contrary, Wheezy was a mess.
Soon I will do some experimentation about this bug in a separate disk. I am
not sure that the problem resides in the operating system, or in Xfce, or in
my programs. I am not a perfect programmer.
My best wishes
Luis Duarte
