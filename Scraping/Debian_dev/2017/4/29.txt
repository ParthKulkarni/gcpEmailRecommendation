This is even more difficult when you are required to choose between
a subset of a particular vendor due to professional rules ("marchÃ©s
publiques" in French)

The previous rules make us choose DELL laptop. It worked reasonably
well. For my last laptop, I had to choose a HP one (ZBook 15). It is
a pity. I cannot suspend/restore reliably if I want to use the
NVidia card with the nouveau driver (I never tried the non-free
NVidia one) and not only the Intel card (and, on my laptop, the
external DP port is only wired to the NVidia card...)
  I already reported some bugs in the kernel/acpi/nouveau that
have been fixed. But it was 'easy' : these bugs were systematic/
reproducible.
  I've to create a new (kernel) bug with the current situation but
it is difficult to do so. The freeze are not systematic, they are
hard freeze (nothing in the logs), generally after a resume.
I'm under the impression they occur in ACPI routines.
Currently, I'm using the 4.7.0-1-amd64 kernel that allows me to
suspend/resume about 10 times between freeze (and hard reboot).
I've to test the 4.9 and 4.10 newly uploaded, but a few days ago,
with the previous versions, the 4.9 and 4.10 were freezing at nearly
each resume.
  Two days ago, I ran the Ubuntu firmware tests on this laptop:
Test           |Pass |Fail |Abort|Warn |Skip |Info |
---------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
[...]
Total:         |  981|  195|    2|   33|  222|   11|
  I think the HP Bios is not really of good quality...
  Regards,
    Vincent
