Note that it took a _ton_ of iterations for systemd-networkd to
converge on a behavior that at least most people would consider
sane in the case of IPv6 forwarding. And part of the problem is
that the kernel's knob for IPv4 has very different semantics
from the same knob for IPv6.
In general I believe that the networking part of sysctl kernel
interface is not really that well designed. At lest with Jessie's
kernel (I haven't checked in a while) settings aren't inherited
by a newly created namespace, but instead are the kernel's
default settings - just to give one other example I've stumbled
upon.
