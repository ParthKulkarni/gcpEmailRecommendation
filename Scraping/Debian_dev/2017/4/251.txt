I always thought that Debian shipping what is essentially
documentation in /etc is weird. This stuff belongs in the manual pages
or other documentation.

Indeed, most default configuration is in one of /usr/*bin /usr/lib
/usr/share and isn't in a form that can be version controlled or
compared between versions.

Especially since most packages don't use ucf, which has 3-way merge.

Likewise.

I've always found ucf's 3-way merge to do exactly what I want.
