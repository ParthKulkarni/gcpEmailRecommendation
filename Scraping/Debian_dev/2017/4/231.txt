We cannot unilaterally standardize something like that.  If we want to
push for a standard for package defaults (and I do like the idea of
having a standardized directory under /usr for those rather than just
putting them under /usr/lib/package or similar), we need to work with
upstreams to do so.  /usr/lib/defaults/ does seem plausible.
