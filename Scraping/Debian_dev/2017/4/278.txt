  Description     : incident response framework - pre-built client templates
GRR Rapid Response is an incident response framework focused on remote live
forensics. It consists of an agent (client) that is installed on target
systems, and server infrastructure that can manage and talk to the agent.
This package contains pre-built binary components which are used by the server
to build Linux, Windows, and MacOS X client installers and which cannot
currently built from source on a Debian system. For this reason this
package targets the non-free/utils section.
