The reason that you can't dist-upgrade RHEL is that there's too large
a gap between releases.
Let's look at the release dates and compare like with like.
RHEL 6: November 2010
RHEL 7: June 2014
Debian 6 (squeeze): February 2011
Debian 7 (wheezy): May 2013
Debian 8 (jessie): April 2015
You can't dist-upgrade RHEL from 6 to 7 and you can't dist-upgrade
Debian from 6 to 8 in one leap.
