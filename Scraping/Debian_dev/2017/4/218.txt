Ohai,
LXC recently got a bug (#860974) that is best fixed by bumping a certain
sysctl limit above the default.
However I could not find any documented policy how to do this (if at all).
Both, procps and systemd support (/usr)?/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf, however only
one package (systemd-coredump) uses it, all others drop files in
/etc/sysctl.d.
Some packages also trigger "sysctl -q -p <file>" in their postinst, but
most do not.
My gut feeling is that droping the file to /usr/lib and allowing the admin
to override it later via /etc. And then load it in postinst.
But this does not account for the fact that this specific tunable may be
already overriden in another sysctl.d file and the package would reset
it to a lower value?
What do others think about that?
Cheers
Evgeni
