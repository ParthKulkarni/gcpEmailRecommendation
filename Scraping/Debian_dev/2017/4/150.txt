  Description     : Runtime code generation for the Java virtual machine.
Byte Buddy is a code generation and manipulation library for creating
and modifying Java classes during the runtime of a Java application and
without the help of a compiler. Other than the code generation utilities
that ship with the Java Class Library, Byte Buddy allows the creation of
arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for the
creation of runtime proxies. Furthermore, Byte Buddy offers a convenient
API for changing classes either manually, using a Java agent or during a
build.
The package is a dependency of freeplane 1.6.x, where it is used
to fix a security issue in groovy. I plan to maintain it in the
debian-java team. The playground version is created here:
