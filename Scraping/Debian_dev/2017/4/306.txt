  Description     : command-line fuzzy finder
I use this as my shell's reverse-i-search. It brings up an ncurses
interface in which to do fuzzy searching across my shell history.
For example, suppose I know the following is in my history, but I cannot
remember it:
echo | openssl s_client -msg -connect nm.debian.org:443 -servername
nm.debian.org 2>&1 | grep CertificateRequest
With fzf, I press ^r, and am presented with an ncurses interface where I
can then type something like "openssl nm CertReq" to quickly filter my
entire history to just a few relevant entries, all while receiving
visual feedback of the filtering process.
It comes with plugins for bash, zsh, fish, vim.
Since fzf is written in Go, I will apply for collaborative maintenance
with the Go Team, and seek a mentor within that team to get this to
Debian quality and uploaded.
I have started packaging at https://github.com/tomfitzhenry/pkg-fzf and
will move to the Go Team's Alioth repository if appropriate.

Tom Fitzhenry
