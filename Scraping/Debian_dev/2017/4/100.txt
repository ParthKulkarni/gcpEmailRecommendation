  Description     : Golang AMQP mocking library
 AMQP is a verbose protocol that makes it difficult to implement proper
 unit-testing on your application. The goal of Wabbit is to provide a
 sane interface for an AMQP client implementation based on the specification
 AMQP-0-9-1 (no extension) and also an implementation of this interface
 using the well established streadway/amqp package.
