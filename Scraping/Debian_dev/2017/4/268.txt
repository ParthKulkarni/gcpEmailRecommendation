  Description     : libraries used by PSORTb bacterial localization prediction tool
 libpsortb was created by Matthew Laird of the Brinkman Laboratory at
 Simon Fraser University.  It was created to provide a more user friendly
 installer for the various C and C++ libraries used by Psortb.  This
 library must be successfully be installed before the Perl bindings from
 the main Psortb package will work.
 .
 PSORTb enables prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization
 (SCL) and provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight
 into protein function, verifying experimental results, annotating newly
 sequenced bacterial genomes, detecting potential cell surface/secreted
 drug targets, as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes.
Remarks:
 1. The text above is not the long description of the prospective
    package.  Since some of the contained libraries are packaged
    for Debian only two libraries are left.  Other code is stripped
    from the tarball, and the two remaining libraries are packaged
    into different binary packages with different descriptions.
 2. The package will be maintained by the Debian Med team at
      https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debian-med/libpsortb.git
