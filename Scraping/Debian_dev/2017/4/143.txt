I've got a similar problem while packaging recent webkit (latest surf
needs a newer one). Their git repo is >GB (!). No idea how much I'll
have to cut out here yet (still pulling) ...
By the way: is there any automatic way for creating the -dfsg trees out
of the upstream ? (I prefer working directly w/ git repos instead of
additional patching)
