Moreover, this is not the right way to handle system users. Just use:
  deluser --system diaspora
No need to test if the user already exists.
adduser.sh does things better but tries to be smart and hard-code the
fact that FIRST_UID is 1000, while it can be anything else. Better just
rely on adduser output for the warning.
