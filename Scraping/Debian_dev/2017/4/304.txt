I don't think we should revive this package in Debian.  There has been
much effort upstream in the last years to reduce the amount of
device-specific code in userspace drivers, with things stabilizing
around the evdev and now libinput drivers.  Why does libinput not
satisfy your needs, and why can't it be made to?
