Yes, sure. This discussion is getting increasingly side-tracked though.
The original question was "should I install defaults in /etc or /usr?"
to which I replied that in Debian, we've traditionally done the former
rather than the latter, and that the latter feels like a result of an
ecosystem (other than ours) where dealing with conflicting changes to
configuration files is frowned upon. I think our way is better, but I'm
sure others disagree.
Regardless, traditionally we've been doing it "our" way, and therefore
it seems reasonable to believe that our users will expect things to
continue working "our" way. Whether that is better than the "other" way
is besides the point that I was trying to make (even if I believe that
to be true).
