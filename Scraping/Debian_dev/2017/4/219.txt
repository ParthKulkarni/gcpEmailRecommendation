Please drop it in /etc, debhelper/dh should mark it as conffile and
everything will work.
Alternatively, use ufc (refer to ucf(1) and its documentation if you are
not used to ucf.  Help is also available at debian-mentors@l.d.o), and
handle it as a configuration file in /etc managed through ucf and
package maintainer scripts.

What to do here is decided on a case-by-case basis, I suppose.

Drop it in /etc where it belongs, and let the maintainer to modify or
override (by deleting, even).
Leave the /usr/lib overriden by /etc thing alone.

Yes.  If you use ucf instead of the builtin dpkg conffile management,
you can do something much better:
1. read current levels (using sysctl, not directly).
2. if they are above the default, don't change the state of the system:
   if your config file is there, let ucf handle its update normally.  if
   your config file is *NOT* there, assume deleted and help ucf a little
   (ucf can do this by itself most of the time: we have always handled
   deletion of config files in /etc as an action to be preserved, but
   *not* at first install)
3. if they are at a dangerous level, install your config file to /etc
   normally, using ucf.  And document that the user needs to reboot
   somewhere.
The above is a rough idea.  You are likely to also have to have
different paths for initial install and upgrade/downgrade.  And if you
actually activate the new sysctl, you might not be able to do (1) that
way should it would break indepondence (and complexity would go up a
great deal).
