This seems like a recipe for a very confused sysadmin, wondering what
non-standard mechanism is messing with sysctls out-of-band and making
configuration file editing/preservation decisions based on sysctl values
rather than just the files themselves.
I would suggest, instead, working with sysctl upstream to add an
"increase if not at least this value, but don't decrease if above this
value" mechanism.  That'll take a while to propagate widely enough, but
once it does, you could use such a mechanism to ensure you have a large
enough value to function without overriding a larger value set in
another file.
Also, you don't generally need to reboot to apply changed sysctls.
