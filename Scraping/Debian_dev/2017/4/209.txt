I don't think this number is bad per-se (assuming this extra_source_only
just meant it has "Build-Using"). The bad thing in my opinion is when
multiple version are kept around for a long time. I use this Build-Using
in multiple of my package, exactly to be able for this kind of analysis
(and in the end I hope globally fixing per release with (binNMU)
rebuilding).
