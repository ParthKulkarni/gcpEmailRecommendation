Did Linux development move as quickly as it does now?
Did users experience more problems or failures when running those dist-upgrades?
Of course duration matters. It's not the same use-case as a Debian
dist-upgrade but feel free to look up gentoo-user@ threads where a
user kicks them off with "I haven't upgraded for 6 months, 1 year, 3
years." The longer the period, the more problems.
Simply because Debian supports dist-upgrades doesn't make them easy or
doesn't make the duration between them irrelevant. We're on a more or
less two-year cycle and it makes dist-upgrades easier that if we were
on a 4-year cycle; I don't see what can possibly be debatable about
this.
