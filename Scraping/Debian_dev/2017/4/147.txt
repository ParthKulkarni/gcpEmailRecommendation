  Description     : utility for setting X wallpaper
Hi,
While reviewing feh (and imlib2 dependency) from security aspect Tobias
found a few issues in it. While those were fixed upstream, imlib2 is
marked as legacy and no release is expected soon. As alternative to feh
Tobias decided to write an even simpler tool for setting the wallpaper,
which is conveniently named xwallpaper (with xsetwallpaper already being
used by NetBSD people).
It has minimal dependencies (libxcb, libjpg, libpng, libxpm) and is
just above 1000 lines of code. Regarding to background setting support
it supports all of feh's modes while using less resources and being
faster. Compared to feh unsupported features are image loading from
URLs and automatic creation of a status file. Also parameter syntax
is slightly different following the syntax of xrandr.
