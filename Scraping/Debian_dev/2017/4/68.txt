  Description     : PostgreSQL Audit Extension
 The pgAudit extension provides detailed session and/or object audit
 logging via the standard PostgreSQL logging facility.
 .
 The goal of pgAudit is to provide PostgreSQL users with capability to
 produce audit logs often required to comply with government, financial,
 or ISO certifications.

 An audit is an official inspection of an individual's or organization's
 accounts, typically by an independent body. The information gathered by
 pgAudit is properly called an audit trail or audit log.
