I first used it with RHEL 3 for some company-developed apps but it
might predate that.
But Google says that it was available since at least RHL 9:
http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/jw35/docs/rpm_config.html
Fedora has an rpm draft doc:

It must've slipped my mind because I disable the interactivity.
Indeed, dpkg has the advantage that an administrator can change the
behavior at run-time, for the current transaction or for all, but that
flexibility doesn't give dpkg an advantage over rpm for dropping
config files in "/etc" rather than in "/usr/lib".
