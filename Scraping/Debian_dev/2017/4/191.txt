Package: general
Severity: normal
My windows manager is Xfce. Using Thunar - when I opened a directory containing
perl programs, somethimes I click two times on a perl program to start it. No
Xterm appears - what I think that happen is that my disk become full. I happen
a lot of times in Wheezy, but in Jessie it happened one times. I don't know if
this happens (the disk became full) as I described, if it is a bug of Xfce, or
if it is a bug of Jessie. In Jessie I freed some space on disk, and I restat my
computer, and everything runs as normal (with space freed). I Wheezy I had a
lot of problems.
