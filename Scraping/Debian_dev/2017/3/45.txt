Signatures don't protect you in this case, because they only cover the
message body, not even the headers.
This also means that signing *everything* isn't necessarily a good idea: if
you sign a re-usable message body, anyone can re-send that body and your
signature with different headers (different subject, different apparent
sender and recipients) and a different envelope (different real sender and
recipients).
