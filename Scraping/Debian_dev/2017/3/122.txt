Policy doesn't have an RFC 2119 SHOULD.  A Policy "should" means that
something is generally a bug, just not an RC one.  It would be nice to
have the equivalent of SHOULD ("this is normally not a good idea but may
be the correct thing to do in specific situations"), but we don't
currently have that.
This would definitely declare lots of existing packages buggy, which is
something we normally try not to do because usually packages are doing
this for some good reason (and I think that's obviously the case here).
