  Description     : Go bindings for YARA
 Go bindings for YARA (http://plusvic.github.io/yara/), a description language
 and scanning engine for malware families based on textual or binary patterns.
 The bindings' intention is to stay as close as sensible to the library's C
 API while taking inspiration from the yara-python implementation.
