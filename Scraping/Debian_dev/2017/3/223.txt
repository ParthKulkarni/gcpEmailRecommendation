If you have a specific issue with Debian, please report a bug about it:

If you are not sure which part of Debian to report the bug against,
please contact our support channels for help:

Who are you interested in contacting and what kind of cooperation do
you have in mind?
There are many ways to help Debian, some of them are listed here:
https://www.debian.org/intro/help
Donations and sponsorship are appreciated:

In 2018 the annual Debian conference will be held in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
It would be great if Archermind could help fund DebConf18 and
Archermind developers could attend DebConf18.

Sponsorship information for DebConf17 is listed here:
