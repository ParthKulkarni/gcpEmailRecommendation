Are you a lawyer?
In that case maybe you can explain me how is that RedHat (a company that
makes billions of dollars worth of revenue and that is clearly much more
interesting to sue than Debian if your intention when suing is seeking
some economic compensation), is shipping GPL software (pure GPL --
without any OpenSSL linking exception on the license) and linked with
OpenSSL, by simply declaring OpenSSL a system library, and nobody has
still sued (or complained to) them for doing that? [1]
And if you are not a lawyer (I am not), then I suggest we (the Debian
project) seek for legal advice regarding whether is ok to do this or not.
We did this after the ZFSonLinux package was blocked for years on the
NEW queue because there was a disagreement whether shipping it was ok or
not. And the lawyers from SFLC told us that shipping it t was ok [2].
