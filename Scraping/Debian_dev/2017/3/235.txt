Package: general
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
I do not know under which package this bug should be filed or what additional
information is needed to help solve this.
I am running Debian stretch and have configured it to give me text consoles on
boot. I have intel graphics and for Xorg I am using the modesetting driver 
which has been the default for some time.
The steps to reproduce the bug are as follows:
1) login on first vt.
2) run "startx" on frist vt.
X is now running normally.
3) Ctrl+Alt+F2
4) login on second vt.
I can use the text console normally. I can also switch back and forth between
the first vt (with X) and the second vt (text console) without problems.
5) run "exit" on second vt.
I now automaticaly see my X session on the first vt again. However, I can not
move the mouse and my keyboard is not working. The system seems to be frozen.
6) Alt+F1
After typing Alt+F1 in the frozen state, the X server dies and I get back
the text console. I can now start X again.
Note: If I override the driver by putting Driver "intel" into xorg.conf,
I get the same behaviour except that after Step 6 my screen just turns
black completely.
