[I note that I missed this question earlier.]
Yes, the message that Illuminati got (which he subsequently replied to)
almost certainly didn't go via any debian infrastructure at all (if the
similar messages I got were anything to go by, which I think they are).
However, because the spam meaasges are created by copying most of the
headers from a genuine list mail, when you reply to such a message, it
turns up on our lists, and looks like it might even be a reply to a real
thread (until you notice that the body of the message they were replying
to has never previously been seen on the list).
Cheers, Phil.
