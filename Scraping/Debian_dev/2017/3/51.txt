There is AFAIK no motive to “get standards documents out of Debian”.
Your characterisation, “trying to get standards documents out of
Debian”, describes whose motives? Not Simon's, as best I can see. That
seems needlessly antagonistic.
Instead, the stated motive is to ensure all works in Debian are free.

That is a laudable goal, but you present it misleadingly as though it
were in opposition to Simon's. It is not: the documents can be in Debian
if licensed under free-software terms to all recipients.
So, to the extent that would allow such documents in Debian, yes I agree
that is a solution in which it is worth investing effort.

Since that does not describe the license granted in these documents, I
don't see why you raise it.
On the contrary, I would like to see the license granted in these
documents changed to conform to the DFSG, and then they can be included
without violating or changing our social contract.
