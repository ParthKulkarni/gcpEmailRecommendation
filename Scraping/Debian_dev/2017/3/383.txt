The literal text of the GPLv2 would not allow that:

Emphasis on "unless that component itself accompanies the executable".
The intention of the system library exception is to allow third parties to ship Free Software on proprietary platforms, while pointedly *disallowing* the vendor of the proprietary platform from doing so.  As historical precedent, note that some vendors explicitly provided entirely separate media containing GNU applications, in order to satisfy that requirement.
