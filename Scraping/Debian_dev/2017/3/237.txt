  Description     : genealogy data from US Census 1990
    The United States Census Bureau receives numerous demands for
    summary data on the frequency of surnames for genealogical
    reasons. Similar interest has arisen for the frequency of first
    names by sex.
    This data set attempts to satisfy these demands while still
    providing utmost confidentiality of individual results.
This package provides source needed to build some password-strength
checking software. It is general enough that it can be useful for many
other purposes also.
