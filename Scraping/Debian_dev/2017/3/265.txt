  Description     : python3 library for data serialization using typed netstrings
Tnetstring is a lot like JSON but it uses a new syntax called "typed
netstrings" that was proposed for use in the Mongrel2 webserver. It's
designed to be simpler and easier to implement than JSON, with a happy
consequence of also being faster in many cases.
This Python library provided functions to read and write tnetstrings.
It's a port of the python2 tnetstring library.
The python2 version is available in debian as package 'tnetstring'. I was
asked by users of that package if I could package the python3 version,
as well.
