pgpLXgsMF1ETO.pgpPackage: tor
Version: 0.0.7.2+0.0.8pre2-1
Severity: important
Tor versions prio to 0.2.9.10 and 0.3.0.4-rc contain an integer
underflow in its version comparison.  When tor gets built with ftrapv,
this is a remotely triggerable DoS.
This is part of the security issue tracked as TROVE-2017-001 upstream.
