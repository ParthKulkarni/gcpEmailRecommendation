  Description     : module to export monitoring metrics for Prometheus
Net::Prometheus provides the ability for a program to collect monitoring
metrics and export them to the Prometheus.io monitoring server.
As Prometheus will expect to collect the metrics by making an HTTP request,
facilities are provided to yield a PSGI application that the containing
program can embed in its own structure to provide the results, or the
application can generate a plain-text result directly and serve them by its
own means.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
