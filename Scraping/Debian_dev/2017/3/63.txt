The antimetapackage doesn't force anything on the user, its effect is only
"install this empty package to signal you're ok with this badness".

Alas, currently Recommends are so out of whack that I tend to ignore them
rather than install around half of the time.  Thus, if you need to ignore a
Recommends for an unrelated reason, your wishes wrt allowing or not
something non-free would be accidentally disobeyed.
An empty metapackage with no (non-metapackage) depends of its own has no
effect on the system other than allowing potential dependers in.
