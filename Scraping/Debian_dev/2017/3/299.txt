  Description     : control monitor settings
ddcutil is a Linux program for querying and changing monitor settings, such as
brightness and color levels.
ddcutil primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) to
communicate with monitors implementing MCCS
(Monitor Control Command Set) over I2C.  Normally, the video driver for the
monitor exposes the I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  Alternatively,
there is support for monitors (such as Eizo ColorEdge displays) that implement
MCCS using a USB connection.
A particular use case for ddcutil is as part of color profile management.
Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in
effect, e.g. red gain.  ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved at
the time a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration is
applied.
ddcutil can be seen as a replacement for the no longer maintained ddccontrol.
It differs from ddccontrol in several ways that should make it more robust:
- It relies on the i2c-dev userspace interface to I2C rather than attempting to
program specific video cards at the PCI level.
- It uses detailed knowledge of the Monitor Control Command Specification
(MCCS) to interpret settings instead of hand crafted monitor-specific
configuration files.
