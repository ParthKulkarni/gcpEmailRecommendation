pgpK9DaL_nsaA.pgpPackage: tor
Version: 0.2.4.7-alpha-1
Severity: important
Tor versions prior to 0.3.0.3-alpha and 0.2.9.10 would incorrectly
reject IPv6 exit requests.
>From the upstream changelog that fixes this issue:
    - Stop rejecting all IPv6 traffic on Exits whose exit policy rejects
      any IPv6 addresses. Instead, only reject a port over IPv6 if the
      exit policy rejects that port on more than an IPv6 /16 of
      addresses. This bug was made worse by 17027 in 0.2.8.1-alpha,
      which rejected a relay's own IPv6 address by default. Fixes bug
      21357; bugfix on commit 004f3f4e53 in 0.2.4.7-alpha.
Cheers,
