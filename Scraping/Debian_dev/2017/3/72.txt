  Description     : C++ wrapper for PCRE2 library
 > PCRE2 is the name used for a revised API for the PCRE library, which is a
set of functions, written in C, that implement regular expression pattern
matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl, with just a few
differences. Some features that appeared in Python and the original PCRE before
they appeared in Perl are also available using the Python syntax.
 .
 This provides some C++ wrapper classes/functions to perform regex operations
such as regex match and regex replace.
 .
 It's a header only (single header) library. All you need to do is include the
header in your program.
 .
