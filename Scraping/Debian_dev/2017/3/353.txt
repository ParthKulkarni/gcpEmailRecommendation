But we make similar risk assessments all the time.  Some of us even
strongly defend the right to anonymous contributions, that is, they
argue against keeping exact copyright records, which could otherwise
be used to identify the party who added code for which they did not
have permission (so that Debian or a liable Debian contributor could
recover their costs from them).
