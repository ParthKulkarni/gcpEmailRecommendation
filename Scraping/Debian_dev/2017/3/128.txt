appstream itself is installed on ~60% of sid/stretch desktops [0], but 
isenkram on only ~5% (and most of those are the -cli version).
When beignet-opencl-icd added AppStream metadata (black line in [1]), 
there was no noticeable increase in its installs.  As it's for popular 
hardware (~33% of systems [2]) but a sufficiently behind-the-scenes 
feature that few users manually install it, this is a fairly sensitive 
test: <10% of new (including newly upgraded) sid/stretch desktop 
installations with the hardware installed it.
Hence, either most users don't see AppStream suggestions, or most users 
don't want GPU compute when offered the option.  (beignet-opencl-icd's 
AppStream summary/description are "OpenCL (GPU compute) driver for Intel 
GPUs"/"This allows using Intel integrated GPUs for general computation, 
speeding up some applications."  At least libreoffice-calc and probably 
ffmpeg can take advantage of it, but it's very possible that typical use 
of these is either on too little data to notice the difference, or has a 
better option (libva/libvdpau).)

libvpx4 (video decoding, dependency of firefox and chromium) and 
libllvm3.9 (compiler library, dependency of libgl1-mesa-dri) were chosen 
as approximations of "all stretch/sid desktops", as they have changed 
soname since jessie.
