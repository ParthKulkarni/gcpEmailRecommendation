 Description     : Apache Kafka Go client by Confluent
Confluent's Kafka client for Go wraps the librdkafka C library, providing
full Kafka protocol support with great performance and reliability.
.
The Go bindings are supported by Confluent, founded by the creators of Kafka,
and part of their Confluent Platform offering, so the client can be expected
to keep pace with Kafka development.
.
The Go bindings provide a high-level Producer and Consumer with support for
the balanced consumer groups of Apache Kafka 0.9 and above.
Although there is already one Kafka Go client in the archive[0] and an ITP for
a second one[1] I believe it makes sense to also include confluent-kafka-go.
It's a fairly new client written by Magnus Edenhill, the author of librdkafka
which handles all the low level bits of the Kafka protocol.
The fact that this is a wrapper for librdkafka, the de facto high performant Kafka
bindings, and the official support by Confluent make confluent-kafka-go a great
candidate for a Go Kafka client.
I plan to co-maintain it under the pkg-kafka umbrella along with the Python
client and librdkafka itself.
