  Description     : JSON and binary serialization library for data structures
 Tendermint go-data is designed to provide a standard interface and
 helper functions to easily allow serialization and deserializatio
 of data structures in both binary and JSON representations.

 This is commonly needed for interpreting transactions or stored data
 in ABCI apps, as well as accepting JSON input in the Tendermint
 light-client proxy.
 .
 This package is used by Tendermint Core.

 Tendermint Core is Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that
 takes a state transition machine, written in any programming language,
 and replicates it on many machines.
