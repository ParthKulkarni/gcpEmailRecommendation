It's not necessary, no, although it would be nice ;-). (Simply reply to the
bug with the revised description.)
Note that you don't need to depend on upstream for a description; in fact you
should really write your own, from a Debian perspective. See
https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices.html#bpp-desc-basics
for more information.
