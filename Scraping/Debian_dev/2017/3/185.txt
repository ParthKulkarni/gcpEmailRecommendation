Description: D-Bus service to check the availability of dual-GPU
For systems that have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, this
package by default will force the integrated GPU to be used to save power.
You can launch individual apps using the dedicated GPU by running them
with the environment variable DRI_PRIME=1. Or you can right-click on the
app (while it's not running) in GNOME Shell's Activities Overview
and choose the "Launch using Dedicated Graphics Card" option.
If this default behavior is not appropriate, uninstall this package or
set xdg.force_integrated=0 as a kernel command-line option in your
bootloader.
Other Info
--------------
I am a Debian Maintainer and I expect we will maintain this package in
the pkg-gnome team. Packaging is at
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-gnome/switcheroo-control.git/
gnome-control-center and gnome-shell 3.24 optionally use the interface
exposed by this service. Fedora 25 backported these enhancements to
the GNOME 3.22 it shipped.

The project name is derived from the Linux kernel interface it uses:
vga_switcheroo.
Thanks,
