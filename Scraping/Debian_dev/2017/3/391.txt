  Description     : python module to inspect btrfs filesystems
Project Goal
Currently, the primary goal of this module is to be able to inspect the
internals of an existing filesystem for educational purposes.
A second goal is to provide a nicer way for automating administration
tasks and writing monitoring scripts by being able to just
programmatically access the needed information, instead of having to
spend most of the time on parsing human readable output from other btrfs
tools.
The python module acts as a wrapper around the low level kernel calls
and btrfs data structures, presenting them as python objects with
interesting attributes and references to other objects.
Development progress
The module currently gained a quite good coverage of the kernel API and
metadata structures to be useful for many introspection tasks.
Documentation in tutorial form is still lacking, but the git commit
history has a wealth of documentation on all parts of the code.

I already found a mentor to help with review and uploading. The debian
packaging files are part of the project itself. I've been keeping
debian packages for the library in our own debian package repository at
work for the last year, but now is the time to finish polishing it and
make it available for Debian itself.
As soon as I get the bug # back from this post, I'll built the proposed
packages again and reply with a link to a location where they are
available for review.
Additionally, I'm preparing a second ITP for a package that will already
be using this library to visualize disk space usage of a btrfs
filesystem: https://github.com/knorrie/btrfs-heatmap
