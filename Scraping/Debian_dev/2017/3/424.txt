  Description     : Visualize the layout of data on your btrfs filesystem
The btrfs heatmap script creates a visualization of how a btrfs
filesystem is using the underlying disk space of the block devices that
are added to it. Parts of the disk space that are used more are
displayed with a higher brightness level.
The two-level disk space allocation algorithm that btrfs uses can be
confusing for new users. Why does my btrfs have free space problems when
df does not show a 100% space usage? Since btrfs currently has problems
filling up all available disk space, this program can provide some
insight in the actual usage of raw disk space, being able to show usage
on a full filesystem level and on blockgroup level (2nd level allocation
chunks), providing a wealth of information, parseable to the human eye,
to help debugging free space fragmentation problems.
This script uses python3-btrfs (ITP #858753) to retrieve information
from the targeted btrfs filesystem.
As soon as I get the bug # back from this post, I'll built the proposed
packages again and reply with a link to a location where they are
available for review.
