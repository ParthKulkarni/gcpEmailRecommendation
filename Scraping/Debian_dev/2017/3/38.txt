Yes. SPF, DKIM and DMARC rely on a central point in an organisation.

And the burden is distributed.
The sad thing is that burden remains due being distributed.
For future improvement, I suggest to go back in time.
Think Internet in nineties, the ISP prodived the e-mail infrastructure.
ISP customers were distributed, the ISP was the central point.
I'm not asking for doing dial-up Internet access,
I'm asking for central points for our distributed setup.
