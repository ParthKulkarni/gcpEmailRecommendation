Other Info
--------------
I am a Debian Maintainer and I have packaged this for the pkg-gnome
team. Packaging is at
https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-gnome/gnome-games.git/
The upstream project is named gnome-games which conflicts with the
Debian metapackage gnome-games. gnome-games originally was the name of
the collection of GNOME casual games released together and managed in
the same repo. When they were split into separate packages years ago,
we created the metapackage for upgrades and convenience.
When I complained about the name conflict, the developer suggested we
use the name gnome-games-app for packaging.
