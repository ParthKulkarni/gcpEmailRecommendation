Well, then indeed you'd miss a missing B-D.  That's a concern as sbuild
doesn't use debfoster anymore; autoremove will still usually catch this.
On the other hand, debhelper getting slimmer as opposed to fatter is quite a
rare occurence; you do refresh your chroots from time to time (don't you?);
and as long as at least some buildds / rebuilds use the whole process the
regression won't go unnoticed.  It's far more likely to make an existent
package FTBFS than to affect a new upload.
select sum(install_time),sum(build_time) from builds where status='successful';

Over ¬º!
debootstrap --variant=buildd --include=eatmydata stretch . http://apt.angband.pl:3142/debian
time chroot . eatmydata apt install --no-install-recommends -y debhelper
real	1m13.545s
user	0m30.420s
sys	0m11.735s
(for a realistic test, there were two running sbuild instances at the time,
as usual for this box, both were compiling (pcre2 and llvm-toolchain-3.9))
select count(*)*73.545 from builds where status='successful';
  7‚éñ483‚éñ350
That's massive.
Obviously, the above comparison doesn't apply to running on tmpfs with gobs
of memory, but you optimize cases that need help the most...

Or use "goodbye" for debhelper-less speed. :√æ
