  Description     : A libyaml wrapper for Ruby
 ruby-psych is a YAML parser and emitter. Psych leverages libyaml for its
 YAML parsing and emitting capabilities. In addition to wrapping
 libyaml, Psych also knows how to serialize and de-serialize most Ruby
 objects to and from the YAML format.
 .
 Psych has been included with the main Ruby implementation since 1.9.2,
 and is the default YAML parser from 1.9.3 and beyond.
 - Although psych is part of the Ruby standard library and is included
   in libruby2.3 package, I propose to package this library in a
   separate package mainly for two reasons:
   * A Ruby developer could want or need a more updated version of
   this library than the one bundle in the standard library. This will
   be provided in ruby-psych package.
   * JRuby depends on psych Java extension. Currently this extension is
   being bundled in jruby package but the right thing is to have this in
   a jruby-psych package.
 - It will be maintained in Debian Ruby Extras Maintainers team.
