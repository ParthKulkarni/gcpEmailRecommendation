Hi,
it's certainly a bit late, but I'd like to adopt the courier mta
packages, as stated in the wnpp bugs. (Stumbled over this old mail only
today.)

Well, that's hard to promise, but I'll try to get courier ready for
stretch, in the first place. If that effort isn't successful, it should
better be dropped from stretch.

While I'm a long-time courier user and DD, I clearly don't qualify as a
team. I'd certainly appreciate help and would instantly hand over
maintenance to one.
