Hello Victor,
Thanks for reaching out!  This kind of error usually happens because a
mirror is either out of sync or has some kind of data corruption on one
of its disks.
You can usually deal with this problem by waiting for an hour or so,
then running `apt-get update` again.  If you're still having problems,
try switching mirrors: using the mirror httpredir.debian.org will give
you a server that's geographically close to you.
Sincerely,
