  Description     : Fork of Go stretchr/testify/assert that uses FailNow()
 This is a fork of stretchr's assertion library that does two things:
 .
 1. It makes spotting differences in equality much easier.  It uses
    github.com/alecthomas/repr and github.com/sergi/go-diff/diffmatchpatch
    to display structural differences in colour.
 2. Aborts tests on first assertion failure (the same behaviour as
    stretchr/testify/require).
Reasoning: Required by golang-github-alecthomas-chroma for hugo:
 Hugo 0.28 brings blistering fast and native syntax highlighting
 from Chroma.  A big thank you to Alec Thomas for taking on this
 massive task of porting the popular python highlighter Pygments to Go.
