Now that you are in the habit of switching tools (SCNR), try "apt"
instead of "apt-get" which defaults to deleting .deb files after it has
used them for installation.
The NEWS entry for 1.2~exp1 gives some details on how to disable this
for apt and/or how to enable it for other libapt-based tools.
The short version is:
echo 'APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages "false";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01clean-debs

The cronjob does pretty much nothing by default, you can teach it to run
autoclean or clean or some age-based mixture through (I don't use it, so
I know next to nothing about it and stay out of touching it)
Details can be found e.g. at the top of /usr/lib/apt/apt.systemd.daily
(to whom it may concern: yes, I know, the filename includes systemd.
No, the file isn't systemd specific. There is compat-machinery to call
it from cron if systemd-timers are not available)

People are different, so, much like you will find people complaining
about automatic upgrades you will also find people complaining about you
having deleted files they wanted to share with other machines via
sneaker nets, needed for that downgrade to unbreak their system, want to
hold a bit longer on to the files they have paid a heavy fee/time for
while downloading via mobile/third-internet-world countries or just like
to run their private partial copy of snapshot.debian.org.
I guess we (= Debian) will invent something after automatic upgrades are
done as there is then a "need" for it (assuming those tools don't delete
already, which I am not sure), much like we will eventually figure out
how to phase out old kernels (at the moment they are stuck waiting for
an autoremove to be run, but that can't really be run without user
confirmation).
btw: I don't want to be sounding like "that guy", but reading the
release notes helps preventing "decades-old" as that includes the
suggestion to run 'clean' before the upgrade and Debian releases a
few times within a decadeâ€¦ (heck, apt hasn't reached the "decades"
milestone yetâ€¦ so technicallyâ€¦ but just a few more months).
