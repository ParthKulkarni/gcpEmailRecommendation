Package: wnpp
Severity: normal
s-nail, previously known as heirloom-mailx and nail, is the classic
/bin/mail program, with many modern features added. (Unfortunately it is
not suitable as a "mailx" because incompatible differences in command
line options with bsd-mailx, see #846062.)
If I remember correctly, it was the first package I adopted after
joining Debian as a DD in 2003. After about 14 years and two project
forks/renames, I would like to see someone else take over package
maintenance.
I feel that s-nail is suitable package for people with little packaging
experience to adopt. The current upstream author, Steffen Nurpmeso is
quite active and very responsive.
Cheers,
-Hilko
