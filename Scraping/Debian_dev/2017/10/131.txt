Because for Bullseye, it'll already be pulled in (during the Buster
upgrade) or during the install (as both the Buster and Bullseye
installers will install it). So there is no longer any reason to inflate
the importance â€” the kernel runs just fine w/o and doesn't lose any
major functionality.
Normally it'd only be a Suggests (if anything), but Suggests won't pull
the package in on upgrade.
