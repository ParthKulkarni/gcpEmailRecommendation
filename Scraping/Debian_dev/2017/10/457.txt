Remark: This package belongs to a pyramid of dependencies to upgrade
r-cran-caret to its latest upstream version.  It will be maintained by
the Debian Science team at
    https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debian-science/packages/r-cran-rcpproll.git
Any takers for other new dependencies of r-cran-caret would be
really appreciated.  Also other Uploaders who volunteer to keep on
maintaining the packages are really welcome.
