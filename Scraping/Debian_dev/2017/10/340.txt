Assuming "well-known" means part of Software::License module, you can already 
do something like:
$ cme modify 'dpkg-copyright License:"Apache-2.0"' -save
(the -save option is required due to a bug in Config::Model::AnyId. This will 
be fixed soon)
I hope that Software::License has enough licenses to cover most of the needs.
All the best
