UGH.
I am not convinced this use case should be supported - Even if the
software providers are ourselves, which we trust not to trojan our own
goodies, this still allows for a great deal of nondeterminism. If the
"apt-get source"d package is updated, the build might not work anymore
or might yield different results.
