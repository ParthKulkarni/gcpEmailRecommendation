Hi Drew,
many thanks for your ITP!
Note, that xhtml2pdf is known also as "pisa" - nobody so far could
explain to me, why there is this upstream name confusion.
And pisa is in Debian: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pisa
Unfortunately, pisa is not in a good state. It is not in testing,
and did neither made it to stretch nor jessie. Python 3 support is
needed, too.
Please feel free, to takeover the package or maintain it within the
Python modules team. I'm also still interested in having the package
in Debian, because of trac-wikiprint, but did not have the time nor
energy to take care of the package.
I set Hugo in Cc, because he was also interested in helping.
Cheers
