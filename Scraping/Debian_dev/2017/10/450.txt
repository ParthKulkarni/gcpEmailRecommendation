  Description     : OpenID Connect Identity (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 Provider with Pluggable Connectors
 Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect
 (https://openid.net/connect/) to drive authentication for other apps.
 .
 Dex is NOT a user-management system, but acts as a portal to
 other identity providers through "connectors." This lets dex defer
 authentication to LDAP servers, SAML providers, or established identity
 providers like GitHub, Google, and Active Directory. Clients write
 their authentication logic once to talk to dex, then dex handles the
 protocols for a given backend.
