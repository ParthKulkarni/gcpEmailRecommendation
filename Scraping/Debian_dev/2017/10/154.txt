As with others in this thread, I'd prefer to have apt understand the
concept of architecture variations and instruction set features, as a
variation on multiarch. (apt could potentially have a command-line
option to override that and install a package onto a system that didn't
understand the instruction set features, but that would potentially
require delaying the execution of any code from the package, which could
include maintainer scripts, until runtime, much like debootstrap's cross
mode.)

You can, in fact, simply ship a binary preinst.
~$ file /var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.preinst
