Can anyone help solve this issue?
When I use Nautilus to open a text file, the text file gets opened in the background. That is, the Nautilus window stays in the foreground and the text file is opened in the background inside a new tab in the Gedit window.
How do I make the Gedit window move into the foreground whenever a new file is opened?
I am using latest Debian Stretch. I never had this issue when using Debian Jessie.
