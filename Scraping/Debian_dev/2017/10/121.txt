This is now happening: the side-effect of many new AppArmor features
having landed in Linux mainline (good news!) — before our policy was
updated accordingly — is that AppArmor broke a couple things when
Linux 4.13 landed in sid (sorry, it's the first time we face this
situation and we're learning along the way!), and breaks *lots* of
things when running Linux 4.14. This situation is exceptional in that
years of kernel development are being upstreamed at once, but it's
bound to happen again at a smaller scale, and we do need to deal with
it to support the use case described above anyway.
My plan is:
1. In testing/sid, ship a conffile (in a package built from
   src:apparmor) that pins the most recent feature set fully supported
   by our policy, i.e. Linux 4.12's or 4.13's (depending on whether
   we've fixed all the regressions brought by 4.13 yet); this is now
   tracked by #879584. This should make the transition to Linux 4.14
   smooth;
2. Once our policy has been updated to work well with Linux 4.14's
   AppArmor features (#877581), bump the pinned feature set to 4.14's.
3. Rinse & repeat for Linux 4.15 etc.
And wrt. Stretch + Linux from backports, I'll propose a stable update
of src:apparmor that ships a similar conffile that pins the feature
set to Linux 4.9's (#879585).
I've mentioned a few issues with this plan on the corresponding bug
reports. I propose we discuss them there to avoid overloading this
thread with too many fine details :)

… so we should be good with the above plan. Thanks!
