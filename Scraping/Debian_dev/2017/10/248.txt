Contributers should be able to self-organise within the project and  
for many dds email is their primary means of communication. Sure  
you can just cc everyone involved but then there is no archive and  
no way for new contributers to jump in.

However, I also fully understand and support the decision of those  
who want to
I also volunteer to keep lists.alioth.debian.org up and running with  
full spectrum of the mailing list functionality part. Dozens of years  
of experience running Mailman here, too. /me just subscribed to the  
alioth-staff-replacement [1] ML.
The mailing list service on Alioth is the basis of 80% (or so) of my  
communication / packaging worflow. Dropping the mailing lists is a  
no-go for most of the packaging teams, I am involved in, I feel.
I just looked at moszumanska specs: 2TB disk storage, 32GB RAM, 6  
cores. I am willing to contribute Resources for running such a Mailman  
system (e.g. a VM virtualized on top of root-Server at Hetzner or  
such). But I think that a service like Alioth Mailman should run on  
Debian costs. So, indeed the question is, why DSA cannot provide a VM  
or physical machine to a group of DDs and trust this group regarding  
the server maintenance?
