We made good progress. Thanks a lot to Vincas Dargis and the Ubuntu

Done, see below for the remaining ones.

We're almost there! Remaining blockers:
 - deal with Linux 4.14 bringing in new mediation features and having
   a bug (until -rc6 at least) precisely in the way it handles the
   obvious mitigation I've applied (feature set pinning): tracked by
   #877581, likely 4.14-rc7 will fix it; worst case, if Linux 4.14
   reaches sid with this bug not fixed yet, I'll revert the feature
   set pinning and we'll deal with whatever bits of policy need
   updates (the most important ones all have patches submitted
   upstream + to the BTS already so I'm confident)
 - enable AppArmor by default in our Linux kernel: I'll file a bug
   about it once the above issue is resolved
 - decide how to pull the AppArmor policy + userspace: tracked by
   #879590, started discussion on this list and with debian-boot@
 - anything else?

I'll come back to this later. Not a blocker to start the experiment IMO.
