Actually, it has seen a maintainer upload recently, but by mistake it had a
version number that looked like a NMU.  And that upload was committed to
git.
Indeed, sysvinit is somewhat undermaintained, but as a mature piece of
software it doesn't require much fixing.  For example: if you lxc-create -t
debian -- -r sid, the container created (as of yesterday) doesn't even boot
unless you switch to sysvinit ("Can't mount API filesystems.").
On the other hand, both of openrc's remaining uploaders are lazy bums and
some work is badly overdue...
Meow!
