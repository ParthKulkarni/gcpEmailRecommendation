Hi list,
I'm trying to fetch the wheezy mirror using debmirror.
However, some files are ignored by debmirror. For instance,
wheezy-updates' main binary-installer for i386 has a Packages.gz [1]
file that seems an empty (20 bytes) . debmirror ignores it.
When running debmirror to only fetch that debian-installer [2] i get
following error:
Failed to download any Packages files!
Maybe there is another flag i should add, or am I missing something?
The version of debmirror: 1:2.16~deb7u1Â  but I had the same problem on a
fresh debian9 install.
Any help is appreciated
Thanks,
dalo
