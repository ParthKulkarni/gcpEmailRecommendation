I don't think this is a good idea, and I'm still trying to understand what
problem you are trying to solve.  It took a while until GCC had stable c++11
support, and now you want to fallback to a 20 year old standard by default?
It would be better to spend some time to prepare for -std=gnu++17 instead ;)
