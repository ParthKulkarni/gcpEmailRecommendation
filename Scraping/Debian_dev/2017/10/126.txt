I don't think there is a good way to guarantee which alternative there
apt picks. It could pick to install linux-no-lsm for example (and who
knows, maybe due to fewer dependencies, or a conflict, or whatever, it
will). Even if it works today, that seems fragile...
Also, a Depends: with one of the alternatives being "don't install
anything" strikes me as a hack to work around not having Recommends or
Suggests â€” but we do have those, so I'm not sure why we wouldn't use
them instead.
