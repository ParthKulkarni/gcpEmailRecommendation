The debian-devel list is for the developers who are helping to build the
Debian distribution (and others interested in it) to discuss the
development of the distribution.  A more appropriate place for user
support questions like yours is the debian-user list
<debian-user@lists.debian.org>.  Please redirect your question there.
There is probably also a GNOME IRC channel where you could get help, but
I don't know what it is.
If you find what you believe is a bug (I would discuss the above
question on debian-user first; this might just be a configuration
issue), you can use the reportbug package to file a bug report directly
for the appropriate package (likely nautilus in this case).
Thanks...Marvin
