To clarify Mikes question:  Could anybody provide VMs as a service to a
group of DDs?  My history of {blends,debian-med}.debian.net is
   1. user sponsored it on own expense
   2. GPLhost
   3. some other sponsoring at Rackspace
The continuation of the latter is not clear.  So I'd love to move the
service to some place where it does not need to be moved every 3-4
years.  (This question is not directly alioth replacement related.)
Kind regards
      Andreas.
