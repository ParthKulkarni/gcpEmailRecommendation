  Description     : simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment
Like the famous typewriter, Olivetti mode let's you focus on writing
 rather than on the interface.
 .
 Features:
   * Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window
     margins to keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
 .
   * Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a
     fraction of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
 .
   * Interactively change body width with:
         olivetti-shrink C-c [ [ [ ...
         olivetti-expand C-c ] ] ] ...
         olivetti-set-width C-c \
 .
   * If olivetti-body-width is an integer, the text body width will
     scale with use of text-scale-mode, whereas if a fraction (float)
     then the text body width will remain at that fraction.
 .
   * Optionally remember the state of visual-line-mode on entry and
     recall its state on exit.
 .
   * Optionally hide the mode-line for distraction-free writing.
This package is useful for anyone who uses emacs fullscreen, to reduce
distractions while keeping the blocks of text centered and the lines
short; this increases reading speed, because the eye needs to saccade
less.
In comparison to writeroom-mode, which needs to be renamed upstream
before it can be uploaded to the archive, olivetti is somewhat more
difficult to configure; however, it has enhanced on-the-fly
configuration.
I plan to maintain it as part of the Emacs addons team, and I will
need a sponsor.
Regards,
Nicholas
