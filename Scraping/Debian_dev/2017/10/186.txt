Another one is "import" - should simply NEVER be a program name -
should be reserved.
man page: import - saves any visible window on an X server and
outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the
entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen
git does it sensibly (in the last few years) with a primary basename
and sub commands.
Many of these packages (especially old X stuff) “should” migrate to
the command/subcommand way of life.
I know, I know, show me the patches...

New for me. Thanks.
