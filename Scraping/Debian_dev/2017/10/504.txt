  Description     : Small Angle Scattering Analysis
 SasView is a Small Angle Scattering Analysis Software Package,
 originally developed as part of the NSF DANSE project under the name
 SansView, now managed by an international collaboration of facilities.
 .
 SasView is software for the analysis of Small-Angle Scattering (SAS)
 data.
 .
 It fits analytic functions describing different types of material
 microstructure to experimental data in order to determine the shape,
 size and degree of ordering.
 .
 SasView also includes tools for calculating scattering length
 densities, slit sizes, resolution, fringe thicknesses/d-spacings, the
 (Porod) invariant ('total scattering'), and distance distribution
 functions.
This software is routinely used in scientific institutions to model
and interpret small angle scattering data (SANS,SAXS). A key point of
value is the "marketplace" of SAS models at
http://marketplace.sasview.org/ contributed by the community.
Sasview has been developed as collaboration of international facilities,
including www.diamond.ac.uk, www.umd.edu, www.tnw.tudelft.nl,
www.ansto.gov.au, www.ill.eu, ess-scandinavia.eu, www.isis.stfc.ac.uk,
neutrons.ornl.gov, www.nist.gov and www.utk.edu.
