  Description     : Fast Unicode 9.0 normalization in Haskell
Unicode characters with adornments (e.g. Á) can be represented in two
different forms, as a single composed character (U+00C1 = Á) or as
multiple decomposed characters (U+0041(A) U+0301( ́ ) = Á). They are
differently encoded byte sequences but for humans they have exactly the
same visual appearance.
.
A regular byte comparison may tell that two strings are different even
though they might be equivalent. We need to convert both the strings in
a normalized form using the Unicode Character Database before we can
compare them for equivalence
.
This library implements fast Unicode 9.0 normalization in Haskell (NFC,
NFKC, NFD, NFKD).
This package is required for latest upstream version of haskell-stack.
This package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Haskell
Group.
