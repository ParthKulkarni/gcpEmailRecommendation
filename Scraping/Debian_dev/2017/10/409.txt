Owner: Didier 'OdyX' Raboud <odyx@debian.org>
Package name    : doctest
Version         : 1.2.5
Upstream Author : Viktor Kirilov <vik.kirilov@gmail.com>

Programming Lang: C++
Description     : Light and feature-rich C++ testing framework
 doctest is a light and feature-rich C++98 / C++11 single-header testing
 framework for unit tests and TDD.
 .
 It is inspired by the unittest {} functionality of the D programming
 language and Python's docstrings - tests can be considered a form of
 documentation and should be able to reside near the production code
 which they test. This isn't possible (or at least practical) with any
 other testing framework for C++.
Justification: doctest is a B-D of argagg (ITP #878641)
Package name: doctest-dev, as the package installs /usr/lib/doctest/doctest.h
I welcome suggestions on the source or binary names, as well as packaging :)
