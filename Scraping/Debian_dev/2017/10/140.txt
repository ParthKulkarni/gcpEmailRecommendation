A couple of the key things that the Flatpak developers hope will make it
work better than previous approaches to a similar problem-space are:
* Accepting that expecting an unmodified app designed to be used in a
  non-sandboxed context to be sandbox-friendly does not lead to a
  usefully-strict sandbox, because of factors like those you mentioned;
* Being able to change the libraries that apps use so that some aspects
  of the app can transparently become more sandbox-friendly
Accordingly, various APIs in GLib/GTK+ have been modified to detect when
they are operating in a sandbox and call out to portals instead of doing
the work themselves. These APIs are already sufficiently high-level that
the application doesn't need to see a difference. Of course, this only
works for applications that use a higher-level library API rather than
implementing it themselves, so that probably rules out the Mozilla
stack...
GLib's helper executables like `gio open` (as used by recent versions
of xdg-open when running on GNOME) use those same APIs, so they will
also do the right thing in a Flatpak sandbox.
I don't have an overview of what's happening in this direction outside
GNOME, but I hope that other "platform" libraries like Qt have done
similarly or will do so in future.
