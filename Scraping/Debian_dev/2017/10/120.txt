Absolutely. Here's the status / progress update on this front:
 - In the last 1.5 year three profiles (Evince, ntp and tcpdump) were
   moved from apparmor-profiles-extra to the corresponding package.
 - apparmor-profiles ships only a few profiles currently, all of them
   in complain mode; there's discussion (#830502) about what should be
   done there.
 - The only other apparmor* package that ships policy for other
   software is apparmor-profiles-extra, which currently enforces
   profiles for apt-cacher-ng, Pidgin and Totem.
   I want to move them to the corresponding package during the Buster
   cycle. If you want to help, I recommend starting with
   usr.bin.pidgin and usr.sbin.apt-cacher-ng: both are pretty stable
   and have needed very few updates in the last few years. Totem is
   more complicated; it's also the one that would benefit the most
   from being shipped in src:totem, provided a good workflow is set up
   so users, Totem maintainers and AppArmor people are all happy.
Cheers,
