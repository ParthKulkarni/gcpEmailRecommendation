* Package name    : norm
  Version         : 1.5r6
  Upstream Author : Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)
* URL             : https://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/norm
* License         : NSL (BSD-2-clause lookalike)
  Programming Lang: C++
  Description     : NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) library
The NORM protocol is designed to provide end-to-end reliable transport
of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and
forwarding services.
libnorm provides a shared library and an API to use such protocol.
The NSL releases it under a license that is very similar to BSD-2-
clause. This license is already used in Debian by another software from
the NSL, mgen: https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/mgen
The upstream tarball unfortunately uses WAF, which means it comes with
a waf binary. So it is dfsg repacked to extract it as suggested by http
s://wiki.debian.org/UnpackWaf - a get-orig-source rule to integrate it
with uscan is provided. Care has been taken into making sure the
repacking is reproducible using the appropriate tar options including
clamping the time to SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH if needed.
The library is at ABI revision 1 - there will also be a -dev package
with the public header, the symlink and a pkg-config file, and a -doc
file with the upstream documentation package with doc-base and some
examples.
After libnorm is in the archive some software, like zeromq3, can be
rebuilt to use it and provide additional multicast-based features.
