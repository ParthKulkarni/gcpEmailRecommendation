  Description     : Utility performing various operations on container images and image repositories
 Skopeo is a command line utility that performs various operations on
 container images and image repositories.  Skopeo works with API V2
 registries such as Docker registries, the Atomic registry, private
 registries, local directories and local OCI-layout directories.  Skopeo
 does not require a daemon to be running to perform its operations.
