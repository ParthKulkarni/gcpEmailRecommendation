Description     : A bunch of different CSV files to serve as an acid
test for CSV parsing libraries
csv test data for writing robust csv parsers.
.
A bunch of different CSV files to serve as an acid test for CSV parsing
libraries. There are also JSON versions of the CSVs for verification
purposes.
.
The goal of this package is to capture test cases to represent
the entire CSV spectrum.
.
Please use these in your test suites and send contributions in the
form of more/improved test cases.
.
It is also a node module that you can require() in your tests
.
Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
This package is a dependency of node d3-dsv.
I plan to join Javascript packaging team. Pirate Praveen has agreed
to sponsor this package.
