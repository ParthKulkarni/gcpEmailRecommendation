The source packages used should be tracked, and controlled, so that
the build can be reproduced.  Actually doing that is probably a todo
list item but it seems essential to me.
I think there are already packages that do this.  And (as discussed)
d-i does the same with .debs.  We can use the same mechanism.
The point is not that Debian is a magical source of goodness here.  It
is that _the place where the build-deps are being satisfied_ is a
magical place of goodness.  It's just that our ways to handle
build-time-computed build-deps on uninstalled binaries, or on sources,
are not particularly mature.
