  Description     : 2-DE electrophoresis gel image spot detection
 BEADS is a program for spot detection on 2-D gel images. It is based on
 an analogy with beads flowing uphill on the surface of the gel image and
 on the analysis of their paths (Langella & Zivy, 2008).
Remark: This program was packaged by upstream and provided on a PPA but
it seems to be better to maintain it in official Debian.  This will be
done by the Debian Med team at
