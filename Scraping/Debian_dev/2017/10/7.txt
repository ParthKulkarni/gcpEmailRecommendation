But debian buildds already prohibit network access during build and
these packages has to be binary included always. So the theoretical
security issue never manifests in practice.

That is how it is happening even now as it will always be built on a
maintainers machine. Having pre-built binaries instead will only change
the perception. It makes build process non standard and manual making it
harder for others to build (will need to learn about nodejs specifics
unlike the regular dpkg-buildpackage) or introduce possibilities of
making mistakes (any manual steps can introduce mistakes).
But as I already mentioned in my last mail, I will accept this advice,
even though I'm not convinced.
