Package: general
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
Debian Sid/Buster loosing image icons for file browsers Nautilus, Nemo
(becoming default placemat tree image) and Dolphin (totally blank). Changing
the threshold value for displaying images in Nautilus had no effect. Only new
or modified files effected for Nautilus, Nemo but all files for Dolphin. Effect
noticed shortly after upgrade from Stretch to Buster 64bit.
