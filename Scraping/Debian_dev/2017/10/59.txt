I assume this is because in Andreas's case, debsign is automatically run
on one of the .changes files after the build, which will also sign the
.dsc (and thus change its contents since it now has an inline signature
around it), but the hash in the other .changes file is for the original
unsigned .dsc. Really, you should only be signing the .changes you want
to upload, and *after* you've already checked it for errors :)
