  Description     : Curry Package Manager
 The tool CPM or CyPM (in Debian cpm as a namespace is already taken) is
 the Curry Package Manager. Curry is a functional programming language
 with two available compilers: PAKCS (already in Debian) and KiCS2
 (in prep for Debian).
 .
 The Curry package manager brings you the cypm executable (/usr/bin/cypm).
 .
 The CyPM creates the directory ~/.cpm/bin. This is the directory where CyPM
 installs binaries of tools distributed in packages.
 .
 With CyPM you can obtain a list of available packages from a central
 package repository and install individual packages on request. Packages
 are obtained as source code and compiled with the Curry compiler that CyPM
 was compiled against itself. On the command line, you can override this
 and choose another available Curry compiler, alternatively.
 .
 This package will be maintained under the umbrella of the pkg-curry-maintainers
 team.
