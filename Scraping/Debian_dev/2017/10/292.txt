Thanks a lot for dealing with this issue that way.  I assume that the
wording that was choosen is not really motivating for volunteers.

We several times observed that Dirk violates our Code of Conduct[1] in
a non acceptable way - not sure how honest he will take your comment.
I'd like to come back to the point Dirk intended to make.  At first
thanks a lot for processing lots of packages very quickly when
developers explain good reasons for fast processing.  In most cases
I'm perfectly happy with the communication with ftpmaster when asking
for helping with some packages.  
But there are rare cases when there is no communication between
ftpmaster which is blocking development.  I'd like to refer to an
unanswered mail from April this year[2] where I tried to simplify
the options to answer as much as possible.  We as developers need
some advise how to prepare packages to enable you easily accepting
packages like r-cran-aer.
I think we should use this debian-devel list for some communication
between developers and ftpmaster to smoothen the process of new
processing.
Thanks again for your ftpmaster work
     Andreas.
