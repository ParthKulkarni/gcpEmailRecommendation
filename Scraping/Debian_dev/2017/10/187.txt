import is part of ImageMagick, which is a rather old program and which
grabbed a bunch of very generic binary names.  (import, resize, compare,
convert, display, and stream, for example.)
GraphicsMagick is a newer fork of ImageMagick, and it correctly does the
main command and subcommand thing with gm, but neither fork is clearly
better than the other, so people haven't done a wholesale switch.
ImageMagick is very, very widely used, so reworking it to use a saner
command model is pretty hard.
