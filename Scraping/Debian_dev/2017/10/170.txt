  Description     : emacs major mode to edit MoinMoin wiki pages
A proper long description needs to be written.  The proper long
description will contain something about how moinmoin-mode does syntax
highlighting when editing moin documents.  It also supports supports
and automates custom faces.  For example headings get a different
colour and are have proportionally much larger text than the text
body.  .  Like org-mode, it allows topics and subtopic folding.
Justification: wiki.debian.net uses MoinMoin, yet we do not have an
Emacs mode in the archive that supports editing of our own wiki!  To
the best of my knowledge, this is the only mode for editing MoinMoin
documents.  Given the uncertain future of Alioth some teams are
migrating their pages to the wiki.  This mode will make such a
migration more efficient for emacs users.
I hope to use it to help the Debian KDE Team migrate their page.
Moinmoin-mode does not support remote editing; however, other packages
exist to support remote editing of MoinMoin pages.  They are not in
the archive either, and seem to be abandonware that stalled in the
alpha state.
Current issues: I've submitted a pull request to switch from a custom
long-lines function to visual-mode-line.  Also, moinmoin-mode's
highlighting gets confused with color-themes and/or custom-themes and
90% of the text body (that should be the default text colour) gets
highlighted with the link highlight colour.  For me, that ends up
being unreadable dark blue on a black background.  I have tagged this
bug moreinfo until these issues are resolved.
I plan to maintain it as a member of the pkg-emacsen team, and I will
need a sponsor.

Nicholas
