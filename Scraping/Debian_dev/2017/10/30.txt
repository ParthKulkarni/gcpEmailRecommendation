True but this is the same as when a package in Build-Depends(-Indep)
changes.
In practice I've had the case where an unpacked .deb (instead of an
installed one) would have been enough, and I also have a use case for
a source package: libdatetime-timezone-perl could be binNMUd [0]
against newer versions of the tzdata source package instead of
someone manually doing the dance of downloading the tzdata upstream
tarballing, turning it into .pm files and creating a huge quilt
patch.
Cheers,
gregor
[0] if we had binNMUs for arch:all packages
