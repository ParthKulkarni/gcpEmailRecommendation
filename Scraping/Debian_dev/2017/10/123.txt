I think the only two ways to get a new package installed upon stretch â†’ 
buster are:
1. Suggest the admin do it in the release notes. (It should be 
documented in the release notes no matter which option we pick, of course.)
2. Suggest the admin do it in a NEWS.Debian entry (but it needs to be an 
upgraded package, not a new one, else it won't be displayed. So the 
linux-image-4.* packages won't work, but e.g., linux-image-amd64 would).
3. Have a Recommends or Depends on it from another package that is 
installed. (Presumably that'd be a Recommends from the linux-image-* 
packages, and would be dropped down to a Suggests for buster+1).
Personally, I don't have a preference between #1 and #3, as long as we 
find some reasonable way to opt-out if we go with #3 (and document it in 
the release notes).
