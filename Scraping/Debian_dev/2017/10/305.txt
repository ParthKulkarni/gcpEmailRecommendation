Description     : Argument Aggregator - Simple C++11 command line argument parser
 This is yet another C++ command line argument/option parser. It was
 written as a simple and idiomatic alternative to other frameworks like
 getopt, Boost program options, TCLAP, and others. The goal is to achieve
 the majority of argument parsing needs in a simple manner with an easy
 to use API. It operates as a single pass over all arguments, recognizing
 flags prefixed by - (short) or -- (long) and aggregating them into easy
 to access structures with lots of convenience functions. It defers
 processing types until you access them, so the result structures end up
 just being pointers into the original command line argument C-strings.
 .
 argagg supports POSIX recommended argument syntax conventions.
Justification   : argagg is a build dependency of "Planet Blupi"
 (http://blupi.org) which I intend to package for Debian.
