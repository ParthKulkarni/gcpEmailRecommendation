  Description     : test support functions for Emacs
This package provides functions to support ert, the Emacs Regression
Test framework. It includes:
 * a set of predicates for comparing strings, buffers and file contents;
 * explainer functions for all predicates giving useful output;
 * macros for creating many temporary buffers at once, and for restoring
   the buffer list;
 * methods for testing indentation, by comparison or "round-tripping";
 * methods for testing fontification;
Assess aims to be a stateless as possible, leaving Emacs unchanged
whether the tests succeed or fail, with respect to buffers, open
files and so on; this helps to keep tests independent from each
other. Violations of this will be considered a bug.
Assess aims also to be as noiseless as possible, reducing and
suppressing extraneous messages where possible, to leave a clean ert
output in batch mode.
