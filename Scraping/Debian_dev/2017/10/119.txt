I'm not sure that's actually the case. I can't really speak for it, as
I generally don't use Debian (I primarily use Fedora, openSUSE,
Mageia, and CentOS). One thing I have observed is that there are no
guidelines or policy documentation from Debian on how to install
policy modules. That's a very annoying gap for anyone who wants to
leverage the modular nature of SELinux policies.
Many, many, many common services and applications ship SELinux policy
modules, and they are not packaged in Debian because no one is sure
how to do it.
I've more or less fallen back to telling people to use the Makefile to
build and install the module and hope that Debian does The Right
Thing(TM). But of course, I don't know if this is true.

I can't really say anything about this because the Debian BTS UX is so
awful that I can't ever figure out how to figure out anything in it.
That's a completely different topic, though. :P

I don't think it is quite so bad. Several other distribution families
have Hardened variants that leverage the work in Fedora. For example,
Gentoo and Arch Hardened leverage our work in Fedora and they work
with us in developing and improving stuff for everyone. Generally
speaking, I don't think anyone in the Fedora SELinux project is
opposed to Debian folks coming in and contributing to improve things
for Debian. It's certainly already happening with Arch and Gentoo
folks working with us in Fedora from time to time.
The SUSE SELinux policy is derived from ours in Fedora, for example.
Just because we're on different sides of the divide doesn't mean we
can't come together and do great things. :)
