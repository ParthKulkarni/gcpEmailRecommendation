Two things:
1. -nc is not necessary when passing --target. 
2. You mentioned binary{-arch,-indep} earlier but here --target=binary.
   Perhaps that is the source of the discrepancy? Note that you can call
   any target, not just the official ones. (You may need to also pass 
   --as-root too though).

This sound a lot like a bug somewhere. So yeah, discussion in the 
abstract is not going to do much because what you describe is not 
supposed to happen. Clearly something is failing somewhere, but without 
concrete examples I don't think there's anything actionable.
