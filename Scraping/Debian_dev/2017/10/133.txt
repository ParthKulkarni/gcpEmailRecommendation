So how will bug reports work? For instance I turned it on and now I see
a bunch of warnings[1] from Thunderbird and a bunch of actual failures
when opening links (which is completely broken), because Thunderbird
cannot exec google-chrome-beta. What about integration issues where a
browser should be able to register itself as a browser and hence be
available from applications that try to open links?
Right now thunderbird's profile is owned by thunderbird. Is
thunderbird's maintainer expected to deal with all of these issues?
Should there be some kind of tool where the apparmor team could
aggregate the updates? (I.e. routinely review denies?)
Kind regards
