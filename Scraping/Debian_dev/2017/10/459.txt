Dear all
(please Cc)
I am trying to contact Miriam Ruiz (uid=miriam) but I haven't seen any
sign of life/answer. All recent uploads of her packages are from other
people, her own uploads are from 2015. Her last blog entry is also from
2015.
The only activity I see is on her facebook page
https://www.facebook.com/MiriamRuiz
and her Twitter
https://twitter.com/renacuaja
But she seems to have lost any connection to Debian.
I have contacted her already 6 weeks ago via email and now via Twitter.
I nobody else has any contact or information about Debian activities,
I propose to orphan all her packages. In particular I am planning to
take over Calibre, where she is listed as maintainer but has
*never*done*anything* (ask Martin Pitt who did the maintainance till
recently when I took over).
Thanks
Norbert
