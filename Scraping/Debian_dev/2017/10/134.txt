in the near past I've forwarded bug reports about apparmor suggestions
and issues to Simon Diezel (CC'd) and also to intrigeri. This works
quite well now due a good responsive behavior of both and I'm really
thankful for this!
Right after the beginning of the apparmor profile for
Icedove/Thunderbird I was a bit skeptic if the shipping of the profile
within the ID/TB packaging will work and is maintainable as I haven't
use apparmor ever before and due this have quite zero experience with
that. I got the impression that the profile would be better under the
hood of the apparmor team as there is much more knowledge about the
working model.
Starting with this thread and by some talking to various people I
changed my mind about this. For better flexibility and customizing,
thinking about various releases (like *-security, *-backports e.g.) that
need to be supported, I believe apparmor profiles for the applications
should stay in the belonging source packages in most cases.
Ubuntu is doing the opposite as far as I know [1], the time will show
which way is batter.
But yes, the maintainers of such packages need the help of the apparmor
folks and also vice versa.
For Thunderbird intrigeri and myself came to the conclusion that
especially for the apparmor profile someone from the apparmor team
should be able to contribute changes to the profile directly to the git
tree. So intrigeri has become a member of the pkg-mozilla group to be
able to push changes by himself. I trust intrigeri enough that he will
do good contributions. For now it's the best we can do. This at all is
for sure improvable and we should talk about this on upcoming Debian
events or directly via email.

I suggest to open a bug report for each of such issues against
thunderbird with a description what was done and what was expected.
