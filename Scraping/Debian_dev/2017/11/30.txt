Have you perhaps gathered some data about how many packages would build
reproducibly wrt the old state after a blind mechanical change to R¬≥?
I'd guess it's the vast majority (especially if you change MakeMaker).
I do have a concern: this adds a yet another field every new package needs
to manually set.  And even if in 10 years from now, the Policy will require
R¬≥ to be set (even to "yes" ("binary-targets")), it'd be a manual effort for
every single package.
Thus, what about making R¬≥ default to "no" in a new dh compat level?
