I have filed as many bugs as I can given the time available. I will file one more for the missing .signature, and then I am disabling apparmor.

thank you for taking time to file bugs and provide a report here to help make the apparmor experience better. You have several options for disabling parts of apparmor policy enforcement or its enforcement entirely.
You can disable individual profiles without editing them and messing up the packaging by using aa-disable
  sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird
or by manually by manually removing the profile and dropping a symlink in
 /etc/apparmor.d/disable/
so for example to disable the thunderbird profile you can do
  sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird
  sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird /etc/apparmor.d/disbale/thunderbird
it is important to do the removal before adding the symlink, and as in the example above the symlink does not have to be the same name as that of the profile file.
you can reverse the above by using
  sudo aa-enable /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird
or manually by removing the symlink and loading the profile
  sudo rm /etc/apparmor.d/disable/thunderbird
  audo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.thunderbird
You can disable the apparmor service at the systemd level with
  sudo systemctl disable apparmor
You can remove the apparmor package
  sudo apt-get remove apparmor
or
  sudo dpkg --remove apparmor
and you can also set the kernel boot parameter
  apparmor=0
to disable apparmor on a particular boot, or set it as part of your grub config to permanently disable it without touching the packaging
* for the above examples I have used /etc/apparmor.d/ for the profile location but it could be configured to other locations like /var/lib/apparmor/ etc, it depends on the distro and sometimes the package eg. ubuntu has profiles configured to different locations depending on whether they are system profiles, snap profiles, etc.
