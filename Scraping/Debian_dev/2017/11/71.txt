  Description     : VHDL 2008/93/87 simulator
 GHDL is a simulator for hardware designs written in VHDL. It is not an
 interpreter, it generates machine code from your design for high speed
 simulation. GHDL fully supports IEEE 1076-1987, IEEE 1076-1993, IEEE
 1076-2002 and partially the IEEE 1076-2008 version of VHDL.
This package has been in Debian previously and stagnated due to slow
upstream activity at the time (last maintainer upload 2010, orphaned
2012) and was finally removed from the archive last year. I was briefly
involved in an attempt to revive the package in Debian but I considered
the non-free license of the IEEE sources for the essential standard
library definitions problematic (even though it has been in Debian in
that state for over a decade).
Back then we all agreed that writing free replacements was the way to go
but I never got around to help out with that. Turns out upstream has
implemented that in the meantime (not yet for VHDL 2008 though) so I
guess now is the time to really bring it back.
I am not yet a member of the Debian Electronics Team, but I think this
package should fit in there (like the Verilog simulator iverilog).
