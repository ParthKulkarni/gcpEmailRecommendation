Thanks.
The last 9 days have taught us that it's too hard to confine
Thunderbird with AppArmor meaningfully without breaking at least some
common use cases. We've fixed a bunch of bugs but some use cases
really can't be fixed without making the AppArmor policy essentially
useless. Not a big surprise, it was probably worth trying, but let's
be realistic and move on: Thunderbird will ship its AppArmor profile
disabled by default soon (#882672); users may choose to opt-in.
Cheers,
