With Qt3 we went that way: we did our best to get most stuff ported to Qt4 
then when we knew we got most of the it done we did orphan it and after some 
weeks without anyone adoptiong it we asked for it's removal.
Yes, we do understand that sometimes the only way out is to remove packages, 
but porting from Qt4 to qt5 is not that difficult too (it's even easier than 
the qt3 to Qt4 one).
I still think that if someone misses a Qt4-based app/lib the right thing to do 
is to port it. That will give the app/lib a whole new lifespan too.
