That's why I said, informally, "should".

I'm not wedded to this second half of the sentence.

Aren't these conventions in the python policy, perl policy, etc. ?

I'm not sure I follow whether you mean "please do not specify the name
at all" or "I do not mind what you specify".  I definitely want to
specify that "-offensive" should be used rather than (say) "-off".
It is true that "offensive" may not always be a good characterisation
of the nature of the issues.  That is why I said "usually".

I deliberately used "should".  Whether to split things out at all is a
matter for the maintainer's judgement.  It would be silly to say to
the maintainer "you may decide to split things out, but if you do, you
must not use Recommends".  I can imagine hypothetical situations where
Recommends would be appropriate.
That is, there is a spectrum:
  less problematic content
   just A containing all content    right in some cases
   A -Depends->       A-offensive   very probably silly
   A -Recommends->    A-offensive   right in unusual cases
   A -Suggests->      A-offensive   right in some cases
   A (no dependency)  A-offensive   right in some cases
   just A, but censored             right in some cases
   package not in Debian at all     right in some cases
  more problematic content
We don't need policy to explain why Depends is probably daft here.
The maintainer will figure that out.  The bug I mentioned earlier
shows that it is a good idea to explicitly deprecate Recommends.  I
doubt the maintainer would have made that mistake if they had seen
policy guidance against it.
But that doesn't mean that it should be utterly forbidden.
