I think this whitelisting approach is best.  The reason is that most
of our system has not been hardened and audited against malicious
files.  The need for an entry on the whitelist means that some
developer somewhere has decided that yes, this specific program should
be automaticaly exposed to potentially hostile data.
The lack of a useable exception mechanism, with a sensible UI, is a
big problem though.  Ideally you would ask the user something like
  This { email attachment | web download } is a DESCRIPTION.  The
  program for this is NAME but it has not been audited for security.
  If you're not expecting this kind of file then you probably didn't
  want to open it - it might be malware.
   [[ Don't open ]]
    [ Open this once ]
    [ Always open these kinds of files without asking ]
  You can change your mind about "always" by going to "settings"
  / "security" in the { Thunderbird | Firefox } menu.
