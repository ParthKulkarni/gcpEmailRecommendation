Of course, reducing minbase would be nice as well, but I agree with your
assertion that there is lower hanging fruit to achieve that. I wouldn't
rule out the super-exciting idea as a later optimization step though.

That's a very good question. You'll notice that packages such as
resolvconf (lsattr/chattr), initramfs-core-tools (logsave) or
initscripts (logsave) rely on e2fsprogs. Yet, I did find cases where
removing e2fsprogs (with --allow-remove-essential) works. But the
--allow-remove-essential flag feels super-exciting. :-(

Correct. Unless I am mistaken, removing e2fsprogs from the build set
also removes fuse.
