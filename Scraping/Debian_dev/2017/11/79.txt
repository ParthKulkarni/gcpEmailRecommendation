  Description     : DNS library for LuaJIT
A contemporary DNS library using LuaJIT FFI focused on performance, and
a lightning-fast zone file parser. It supports all widely used DNS
records (DNSSEC included) with a lean and mean API, including DNS
primitives, messages and asynchronous I/O (including coroutines, TCP
Fast Open and SO_REUSEPORT), and DNS over TLS.
Co-maintaining it with the Lua packaging team would be great
