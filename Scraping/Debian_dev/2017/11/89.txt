  Description     : Measure socket and RDMA performance
qperf measures bandwidth and latency between two nodes. It can work
over TCP/IP as well as the RDMA transports.
- qperf is a widely-used tool for testing performance of RDMA
  stacks and fabrics.
- While there is some overlap with iperf3 in the area of TCP
  performanced testing, iperf3 cannot directly test an RDMA
  trasport. qperf allows direct testing of UD and RC RDMA.
- qperf will be maintained as part of my employer's ongoing
  project of supporting RDMA functionality on Debian.
- I do not yet have Debian maintainer status, and will
  require a sponsor.
- qperf will be included in the software packages maintained by
  pkg-ofed.
- I use qperf on a regular basis to test functionality and
  performance of RDMA fabrics with the amd64 architecture.
