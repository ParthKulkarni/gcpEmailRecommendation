  Description     : Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line Debian package builder
This utility makes it possible to build a Debian package from Oracle SQL
Developer Command-Line (SQLcl). The Oracle SQL Developer program is
governed by the copyright holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be
limited as to what you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no
redistribution, etc). This utility will simply help you create the
Debian package, it is your responsibility to use the resulting package
accordingly with the OTN license, a copy of which is included in the
created package, that you must agree on when downloading the source.
This utility will require you to download the architecture independent
archive from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview>,
identified as "Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line for All Platforms", to
create the Debian package from.
Due to a conflicting name with content of package "parallel" the
upstream binary "sql" will be renamed. Multiple versions can coexist so
"sql.[upstream version]" will invoke a specific version of Oracle SQL
Developer Command-Line, while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
"sql.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and,
when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.
 - why is this package useful/relevant?
   It's the way to permit integrating sqlcl (which falls in category
   2.2.3 of the Debian Policy Manual) in a Debian system. Most DBAs use
   SQL*Plus, and/or it's java based portable parent SQLcl, to interact with
   Oracle Database, hence the potential high number of interested users.
 - is it a dependency for another package?
   Yes. It builds the sqlcl.deb package.
 - do you use it?
   Yes.
 - if there are other packages providing similar functionality, how
   does it compare?
   There is no other package providing similar functionality, neverless,
   sqldeveloper-package will build a sqldeveloper.deb which has similar
   funcionalities to the sqlcl.deb package that this wrapper builds,
   however it has a higher level of requirements (i.e. a full JDK
   instead of simply a JRE) and isn't suited for servers or low end
   machines due to it's graphical nature.
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
   I'm the upstream author and it's a native package, it'll maintain
   itself. Please note that I've created another ITP (#882113)
   regarding packaging sqlcl just to avoid duplication of effort by
   someone else. This package will close both ITPs (I know it's weird
   and unusual, but the nature of this kind pf packages is prone to
   this specific situation).
 - are you looking for co-maintainers?
   No.
 - do you need a sponsor?
   Yes.
Thank you very much,
- --
