  Description     : language recognition library by Belledonne Communications
 Belr is Belledonne Communications' language recognition library. It
 aims at parsing any input formatted according to a language defined by
 an ABNF grammar, such as the protocols standardized at IETF.
 .
 It is based on finite state machine theory and heavily relies on
 recursivity from an implementation standpoint.
 .
 The package is probably not useful outside the Belledonne
 Communications suite of libraries and programs.
This package is needed as a dependency of the new
linphone upstream version.
Regards,
Tobias
