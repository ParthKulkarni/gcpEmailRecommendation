  Description     : NeoMutt is a command line mail reader (or MUA). It's a version of Mutt with added features.
To give more context, have a look at b/870635; neomutt was packaged as 'mutt' in
stretch but the current mutt maintainer has raised issue of the tarball being
used: since the codebase of neomutt diverged (initially due to code formatting
changes, then due to some API changes and code split), which made patching mutt
with a single huge neomutt patch impractical (the patch was larger than the
source code).
We have restored original mutt source code at version 1.9.1-1 and given that
this was just done, I plan to spin up a new neomutt package starting from the
same version (with the latest version of neomutt); the plan is to fork the
pkg-mutt git repository from the latest tag and start from there, packaging the
new neomutt version.
