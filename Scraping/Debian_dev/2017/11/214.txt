Hi,
Some of you may have noticed that the existing sparc64 porterbox,
notker.debian.net[0], has been unavailable for the past few months. As a
result, we have commissioned a new porterbox, sakharov.debian.net[1], kindly
hosted by Anatoly Pugachev, available to all DDs.
The machine is set up to closely mirror many aspects of the standard Debian
porterboxes, so you can use the usual dd-schroot-cmd workflow as described on
the Debian website[2].
Please note that this machine should be used to debug issues, and not to
perform binary uploads to the debian-ports archive in place of the build
daemons. The debian-ports archive has its own independent restricted keyring
and so any attempted uploads will be rejected.
If you have any issues or questions, please feel free to contact myself or
cbmuser on IRC (we dwell in #debian-ports), or via mail as listed in [1].
Thanks for your future porting efforts!
Regards,
James
