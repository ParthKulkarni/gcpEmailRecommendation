Hi everyone,
I work for UFC - Que Choisir (a French consumer association) and we just 
released (GPL3) version 2.0 of our job scheduler evQueue.
We are providing debian packages (debian 8 and 9) but would like to know 
if it is possible to get some help to provide these packages directly in 
the debian repository.
Thanks for any help !
Thibault
