I think this is an excelent idea, at least for the case of updates from
eg 2.0.3 to 2.0.4 or some such, and also of course accompanied with
automated tests.
I've also heard plans (early 2017) that some people in Fedora wanted to start
doing such things, but I dont think they have started by now, though I
might be wrong on that last bit. So, clearly, there are others who also
think that this is a good idea.

Experimental seems like an ideal candidate to try this at first.

Indeed.
Thanks for bringing this up!
