Thanks for doing that.
It would be awesome if you could also include some documentation in the
style "I'm a Debian package maintainer and the apparmor profile for some
of the binaries in one of my packages is buggy, how can I fix it?" or
"I'm a Debian package maintainer and I'd like to write an apparmor
profile for one of the binaries in my package, where do I start".
IMO, if apparmor is enabled by default, then making sure it works well
with particular programs is the responsibility of the maintainer of the
program in question.
Thanks again,
