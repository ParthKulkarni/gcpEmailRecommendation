I think this is gross overkill for the very small number of packages
for which it is relevant.  Encoding the situation in the package name,
and/or describing any issues in prose in the Description, seem like
proportionate responses.

If you think I am wrong then the next steps would be:
1. Make a properly documented technical proposal for where this
  metadata would be found and how it would be transferred and what
  format it would be in.
2. Write proof-of-concept patches for at least some of apt-search,
  apt-get install, p.d.o, etc., to allow the user to specify a policy,
  and implmenet that policy.
3. Write proof-of-concept patches for at least some packages,
  adding the metadata.
I think even (1) is far too much work.
