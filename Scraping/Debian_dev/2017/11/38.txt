Package Name: libcloudproviders
Version: 0.2.5
Upstream Authors : Carlos Soriano and Julius Haertl

Description: cloud provider library
 libcloudproviders is a glib based library that makes it easier to implement
 a cloud provider server or client.
 .
 libcloudproviders also provides a DBus API that allows cloud storage sync
 clients to expose their services. Clients such as file managers and desktop
 environments can then provide integrated access to the cloud providers
 services.
Other Info
--------------
Currently, the only supported provider is Nextcloud. This package
won't work for Nextcloud until proposed patches are accepted in gtk3
and there is a new Nextcloud release.
libcloudproviders was a GSOC 2017 project. Here are updates from the
GSOC student:

libcloudproviders is a major part of GNOME's strategy to deprecate the
traditional "system tray".

The somewhat generic name is intentional because it is hoped that this
library will be useful for other desktops and file managers.
By the way, this is one of the first projects to use GNOME's GitLab
beta hosting.

The Debian GNOME team currently intends to maintain this package.
Packaging is at
