I think this is the most problematic point and one of the reason against having
a mutt package that is not a transitional package, despite that I still believe
that we need a 'neomutt' package, this need was raised by the mutt maintainer,
we cannot continue to distribute something called mutt where the source code
comes from another package, which is now completely different.
To provide more context: initially we shipped neomutt as a patch on the top of
the original mutt source code, then at some stage the neomutt team (it is in
thei right) to format their code in a consistent way across all files, so the
neomutt patch became bigger than the mutt source code, which is why I switched
to the neomutt tarball. That was the first and last upload with the neomutt
tarball (also the last upload for neomutt).
The original mutt maintainer raised the point that we cannot call the mutt
package as 'mutt' if the source comes from another package, especially since he
disagrees with some technical choices of the other package, so I think his
reasoning is correct.

In an ideal world yes, in a real world where the maintenance is done by humans
probably not

Unfortunately some non-Debian related commitments trumped my plans; yes I could
have uploaded bugfixes as I did in the past but I made a commitment to Kevin
(original mutt maintainer) to solve the source code issue first. Unfortunately
no easy solution is in sight, so for the benefit of the users I think that it is
better to have mutt as transational package + neomutt.

The existing Mutt packaging team it's just me for some time now, I had a similar
slow period in the past (I was the only maintainer at the time) and we ended up
with the decision of switching to neomutt, decision which I'm still trying to
sort out years later. I'm not trying to blame anyone here, I think who
contributed at the time did a fantastic work; the fact remains that the current
situation is not good for the maintainer of the upstream mutt package and it
needs to be fixed.
Thanks a lot for your feedback, it is very valuable. My last commitment, which
in theory should work, is to fix this situation before the end of the month. I
know that at this point in time this is '10 days from now', but I still plan to
work on it and fix the issue.
