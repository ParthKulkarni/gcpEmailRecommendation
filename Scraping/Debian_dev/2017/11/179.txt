  Description     : Library for computing dates, times, and time zones
CCTZ contains two libraries that cooperate with <chrono> to give C++ programmers
all the necessary tools for computing with dates, times, and time zones in a simple
and correct manner. The libraries in CCTZ are:
   - The Civil-Time Library — This is a header-only library that supports computing
     with human-scale time, such as dates (which are represented by the cctz::civil_day
     class). This library is declared in include/cctz/civil_time.h.
   - The Time-Zone Library — This library uses the IANA time zone database that is
     installed on the system to convert between absolute time and civil time. This
     library is declared in include/cctz/time_zone.h.
The library will be maintained under the roof of Debian Science Team.
