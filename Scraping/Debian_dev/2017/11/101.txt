  Description     : Java light shim library that wraps Java 9 APIs and exposes them to recent JDKs
 Modulator is just a very lightweight shim library that wraps
 Java 9 and previous reflection APIs to allow a uniform API
 into "module"-like behaviors on all recent JDKs.
Its main use case in Debian at the present time is as a JRuby
dependency and it will be maintained under Debian Java Team umbrella.
However, it could be useful to other projects that need to be built
and run with JDK9 and previous versions.
