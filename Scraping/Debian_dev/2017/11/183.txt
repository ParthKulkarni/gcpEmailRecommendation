Package: libqt5opengl5-dev
Version: 5.9.2+dfsg-4
Severity: normal
Tags: patch
Different from other architectures, on armel and armhf
Qt in Debian is configured to use OpenGL ES instead
of full OpenGL.
Some OpenGL-related functionality in Qt is not available
with OpenGL ES, and Qt also offers direct access to OpenGL.
This causes some packages to not build with libqt5opengl5-dev
on armel and armhf, and while making them build would obviously
be the best solution that is not feasible in cases where
upstream does not provide any way to disable this kind of
OpenGL usage or has alternative OpenGL ES codepaths.
A package that does FTBFS on armel+armhf buildds after every
upload is not ideal - it wastes buildd resources and makes
it harder to find bugs between the expected FTBFS.
The Architecture: field does not support negative ! syntax,
and maintaining a completely list of all architectures except
armel and armhf in every affected package is fragile.

 Description: Qt 5 OpenGL library development files
  Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
  is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
This allows packages that require Qt to use full OpenGL to
change the build dependency from libqt5opengl5-dev to
libqt5opengl5-dev-full-opengl, which will place them
in BD-Uninstallable on armel and armhf.
