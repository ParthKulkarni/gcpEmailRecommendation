  Description     : UNIX utilities to deal with Maildir
 The mblaze message system is a set of Unix utilities to deal with mail kept in
 Maildir folders. It is a classic command line MUA and has no features for
 receiving or transferring mail; you are expected to fetch your mail using
 fdm(1), getmail(1) offlineimap(1), procmail(1), or similar , and send it using
 dma(8), msmtp(1), sendmail(8), as provided by OpenSMTPD, Postfix, or similar.
 mblaze expects your mail to reside in Maildir folders.
 .
 Its design is roughly inspired by MH, the RAND Message Handling System, but it
 is a complete implementation from scratch. mblaze operates directly on Maildir
 folders and doesn't use its own caches or databases. There is no setup needed
 for many uses.
 .
 mblaze consists of these Unix tools that each do one job:
 maddr(1)     extract addresses from mail
 magrep(1)    find mails matching a pattern
 mcom(1)      compose and send mail
 mdeliver(1)  deliver messages or import mailboxes
 mdirs(1)     find Maildir folders
 mexport(1)   export Maildir folders as mailboxes
 mflag(1)     change flags (marks) of mail
 mflow(1)     reflow format=flowed plain text mails
 mfwd(1)      forward mail
 mgenmid(1)   generate Message-IDs
 mhdr(1)      extract mail headers
 minc(1)      incorporate new mail
 mless(1)     conveniently read mail in less(1)
 mlist(1)     list and filter mail messages
 mmime(1)     create MIME messages
 mmkdir(1)    create new Maildir
 mpick(1)     advanced mail filter
 mrep(1)      reply to mail
 mscan(1)     generate one-line summaries of mail
 msed(1)      manipulate mail headers
 mseq(1)      manipulate mail sequences
 mshow(1)     render mail and extract attachments
