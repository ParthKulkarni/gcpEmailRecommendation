  Description     : Unix system calls for LuaJIT
A foreign function interface (FFI) implementation of the Linux, NetBSD,
FreeBSD and OSX kernel ABIs for LuaJIT. This means you will be able to
program all the functionality the Unix kernel provides to userspace
directly in Lua. You can view it as a high level language equivalent of
the Busybox project in a way, although the functionality it provides is
somewhat different, and the interface very different.
This is a dependency for https://github.com/vavrusa/ljdns
Comaintaining it with the help of Lua packaging team would be great.
