I don't think that's comparable at all. Excluding documentation, locales
and similar stuff is perfectly fine (and even permitted by policy), as
those are not supposed to be expected even by the same package, and are
not part of the interface provided by the package towards other packages.
Doing the same with binaries or any other interface-providing file
means that dependency system is undermined, more so for an Essential
package, because as the dependencies are implicit, it means *any*
package (its content and maintainer scripts) might become broken,
perhaps in a silent way.
I think that trying to trim down the pseudo-Essential set is an
extremely worthwhile goal, because it has visible effects on several
areas, at least:
 - Possibly making bootstrapping a port way easier.
 - Making it possible and easier to use Debian on (very) embedded systems.
 - Reducing footprint for minbase setups, such as VM images, buildds,
   chroots, and similar.
And most importantly, please do not take this personally, this is not
some concerted effort against e2fsprogs! :) Personally I (and I think
others too) would like to see many other packages out from the
pseudo-Essential set, such as, to name a few: bash, perl-base, tar,
login (any init and login thing really).
