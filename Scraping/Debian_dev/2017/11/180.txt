  Description     : XS implementation for Ref::Util
Ref::Util::XS is the XS implementation of Ref::Util, which provides several
functions to help identify references in a more convenient way than the usual
approach of examining the return value of ref.
You should use Ref::Util::XS by installing Ref::Util itself (packaged as
libref-util-perl): If the system doesn't have Recommends turned off, you will
get libref-util-xs-perl automatically. Ref::Util::XS will be used
automatically, providing a significant speed boost to everything that uses
Ref::Util.
See Ref::Util for full documentation of the available functions.
The package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Perl Group.
