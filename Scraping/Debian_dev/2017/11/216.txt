  Description     : GNU R depth-based classification and calculation of data depth
 Contains procedures for depth-based supervised learning, which are
 entirely non-parametric, in particular the DDalpha-procedure (Lange,
 Mosler and Mozharovskyi, 2014). The training data sample is transformed
 by a statistical depth function to a compact low-dimensional space,
 where the final classification is done. It also offers an extension to
 functional data and routines for calculating certain notions of
 statistical depth functions. 50 multivariate and 5 functional
 classification problems are included.
Remark: This package belongs to a pyramid of dependencies to upgrade
r-cran-caret to its latest upstream version.  It will be maintained by
the Debian Science team at
    https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debian-science/packages/r-cran-ddalpha.git
Any takers for other new dependencies of r-cran-caret would be
really appreciated.  Also other Uploaders who volunteer to keep on
maintaining the packages are really welcome.
