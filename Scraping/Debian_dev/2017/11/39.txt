  Description     : Rhythm game system that supports various formats
This is a rhythm game system that supports various formats, including
BMS, bmson, stepmania, o2jam and osu!mania.
The "vertical-scrolling rhythm game" (VSRG) genre comes from 1997, when
Konami released their first Beatmania arcade.  Then there are simulators
trying to simulate the game mechanics.  The most famous one for now is
Lunatic Rave 2 (LR2 in short).  However, LR2 is Windows-only freeware
(?) app and can crash easily.  This is another work that trying to be
compatible to BMS format (though I don't know if that supports LR2
extension to BMS format), but also supports newer format called bmson
for easier chart-making and faster loading.
Many original works from the BMS subculture spurs and being famous and
gradually becomes recognized by game studios making rhythm games by
inviting the artists for creating music and game charts.
Note that most of the charts are free-to-download but not DFSG free.
Therefore, the charts are not included in this package.  However, many
players could probably know how they can get them easily :)
This should be better maintained under Debian Games Team, though I am
not in the team yet.
