  Description     : Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line
Oracle SQL Developer Command Line (SQLcl) is a free command line
interface for Oracle Database. It allows you to interactively or batch
execute SQL and PL/SQL. SQLcl provides in-line editing, statement
completion, and command recall for a feature-rich experience, all while
also supporting your previously written SQL*Plus scripts.
 - why is this package useful/relevant?
   It is a SQL*Plus (mostly) equivalent with the advantage of reduced
   requirements, dependencies and increased architecture compatibility.
   It offers a standard and classical interface to Oracle Database that
   every DBA knows and is used to.
 
 - is it a dependency for another package?
   No.
 - do you use it?
   Yes, on a daily basis.
 - if there are other packages providing similar functionality, how
   does it compare?
   sqldeveloper (a package created by a package wrapper:
   sqldeveloper-package) is a graphical application that is fully
   compatible to this one, however it has a higher level of
   requirements (i.e. a full JDK instead of simply a JRE) and isn't
   suited for servers or low end machines due to it's graphical nature.
   sqlline is a similar command line package, lacking the degree of
   specific SQL*Plus and Oracle Database compatibility that this one
   presents. 
 - how do you plan to maintain it?
   I don't intend to package it directly. I'm only opening this ITP to
   avoid duplication of effort by someone else. What I intend to do is
   create a package wrapper that in turn will create this package,
   making it possible to include that one in Debian (this one falls in
   category 2.2.3 of the Debian Policy Manual). I have the intention to
   have that package close this ITP, so no loose end will remain.
 - do you need a sponsor?
   
   No.
Thank you very much,
- -- 
Lazarus
