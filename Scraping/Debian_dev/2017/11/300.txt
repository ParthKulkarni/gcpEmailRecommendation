  Description     : YAML-based network configuration tool
netplan is a YAML network configuration abstraction for various backends
(NetworkManager, networkd).
netplan reads network configuration from /etc/nplan/*.yaml which are
written by administrators, installers, cloud image instantiations,
or other OS deployments. During early boot it then generates backend
specific configuration files in /run to hand off control of devices to
a particular networking daemon.
Currently supported backends are networkd and NetworkManager.
