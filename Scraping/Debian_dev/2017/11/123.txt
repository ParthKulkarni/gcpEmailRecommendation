The same is true for Flatpak runtimes, which are purely for user-level
apps and so in principle shouldn't need anything from /{usr/,}sbin or
man page section 8 at all. (Although in practice they do need at least
ldconfig, so scripts to make a Flatpak runtime can't just delete /sbin.)
At the moment my approach to creating Flatpak runtimes involves a lot of
"dpkg --force-remove-essential --force-depends" (most notably to remove
dpkg and apt, which don't make sense in a read-only runtime that can
be replaced with a newer version from the outside but cannot be updated
from the inside) but not much manual deletion.
