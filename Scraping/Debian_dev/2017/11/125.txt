By the way, when I said "super-exciting", that was a reference to an
management euphemism "uncomfortably excited" which generally refers to
the excitement one feels when "working without a net while crossing
the Grand Canyon on a tightrope" :-)
But if you really are focused on getting to Essential: no, and not
necessarily changing the priority field, that certainly is a much more
easily achievable goal.

Yeah, I think the bigger question is whether any of a reduced minbase
needs lsattr/chattr in the first place.

To to be clear, the key metric for your specific goal is the reduction
of the _source_ package count since the goal is to reduce the number
of packages which have to be built by "hand" (or by script), before
you can create a sbuild/pbuild build chroot, correct?
