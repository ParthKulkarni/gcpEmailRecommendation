  Description     : reference implementation of secure world software for ARMv8-A
ARM Trusted Firmware provides a reference implementation of secure world
software for `ARMv8-A`_, including a `Secure Monitor`_ executing at
Exception Level 3 (EL3). It implements various ARM interface standards,
such as:
-  The `Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)`_
-  Trusted Board Boot Requirements (TBBR, ARM DEN0006C-1)
-  `SMC Calling Convention`_
-  `System Control and Management Interface`_
As far as possible the code is designed for reuse or porting to other
ARMv8-A model and hardware platforms.
ARM will continue development in collaboration with interested parties
to provide a full reference implementation of Secure Monitor code and
ARM standards to the benefit of all developers working with ARMv8-A
TrustZone technology.
--------------------------
This is needed to boot various arm64 boards (pine64, firefly-rk3399)
that may not have built-in firmware shipped with them, possibly in
conjunction with an EFI implementation or u-boot.
Some considerations when packaging this:
- Not all vendors are merged upstream; there are several vendor-specific
  forks that are needed in order to support specific hardware, such as
  support for allwinner A64:

I would definitely need some help with initial and long-term maintenance
to make this a reality...
live well,
