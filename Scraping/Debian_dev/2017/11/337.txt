Hi,
thanks for intending to package opencascade! I would though recommend not
to have both versions (original and the fork) in Debian at the same time.
If you have good reasons to bring back original version, please contact Debian
Science Team, which is maintaining oce (and actually FreeCAD) at the moment.
We will try to find a solution for that.
Best regards
Anton
