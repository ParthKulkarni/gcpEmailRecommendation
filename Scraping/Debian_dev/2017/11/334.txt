  Description     : legacy fork of declarative binary data parser/builder
construct (python-construct, python3-construct) as of version 2.8 has
broken its API which has been a problem during the stretch release
(#853082). I believe that a proper solution to this mess is to patch the
handful affected packages so that they import code from construct_legacy
instead of construct and have them depend on this package.
