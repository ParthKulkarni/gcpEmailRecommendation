  Description     : JavaBeans Activation Framework
The JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is a standard extension to the Java
platform that lets you take advantage of standard services to: determine the
type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to it; discover the
operations available on it; and instantiate the appropriate bean to perform
the operation(s).
This API used to be a standard part of the JRE since Java 6, but starting
with Java 9 it's no longer available in the default classpath without a
special JVM parameter, and it's likely to be removed in a future version
of the JRE. Upstream projects depending on the activation framework,
typically through the JavaMail API, are now adding back this jar after
removing it a few years ago to ensure the compatibility with Java 9.
This package will be maintained by the Java Team.
