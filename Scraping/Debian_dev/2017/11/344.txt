  Description     : Fast binary serialization
 The 'store' package provides efficient binary serialization. There are a
 couple features that particularly distinguish it from most prior Haskell
 serialization libraries:
 .
  * Its primary goal is speed. By default, direct machine representations are
    used for things like numeric values (Int, Double, Word32, etc) and buffers
    (Text, ByteString, Vector, etc). This means that much of serialization uses
    the equivalent of memcpy.
  * Instead of implementing lazy serialization / deserialization involving
    multiple input / output buffers, peek and poke always work with a single
    buffer. This buffer is allocated by asking the value for its size before
    encoding. This simplifies the encoding logic, and allows for highly
    optimized tight loops.
  * store can optimize size computations by knowing when some types always use
    the same number of bytes. This allows us to compute the byte size of a
    `Vector Int32` by just doing `length v * 4`.
 .
 It also features:
 .
  * Optimized serialization instances for many types from base, vector,
    bytestring, text, containers, time, template-haskell, and more.
  * TH and GHC Generics based generation of Store instances for datatypes
  * TH generation of testcases
This package is required for latest upstream version of haskell-stack.
This package will be maintained under the umbrella of the Debian Haskell
Group.
