  Version         : 1.1.5

  Description     : Java library aimed at performing fully-featured and high-performance escape and unescape operations
unbescape is a Java library aimed at performing fully-featured and high-performance escape and unescape operations for:
 *   HTML (HTML5 and HTML 4)
 *   XML (XML 1.0 and XML 1.1)
 *   JavaScript
 *   JSON
 *   URI / URL (both paths and query parameters)
 *   CSS (both identifiers and string literals)
 *   CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
 *   Java literals
 *   Java .properties files (both keys and values)
Its goals are:
 *   To be easy to use. Few lines of code needed. No additional dependencies.
 *   To be fast. Faster and lighter than most other options available in Java.
 *   To be versatile. Provides different escaping types and levels in order to better adapt to different scenarios and contexts.
 *   To be feature-complete. Includes full HTML5 support, careful implementation of the JavaScript, JSON, Java, etc specifications, streaming support...
I plan to maintain it within the pkg-java team.
