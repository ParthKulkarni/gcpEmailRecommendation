That is odd.  It has been accepted for over 16 years.   What has changed?   
It is useful to me that the debian/copyright file contain the distribution 
license.  For a one-author package, it could even be convenient to describe 
the author and copyright.
But for a massive multi-author, multi-year work like Boost, there seems very 
little value in summarizing copyrights.  Boost has nearly 55000 files in the 
source distribution.  What could one possibly achieve by summarizing this?  
How would anyone even read and make sense of it?
Has copyright summarizing outlived its usefulness for large sources?  Why 
shouldn't we have some way to say "Copyright by the Boost authors"?
