Hello, Christoph,
do you think you could manage to either point the general -devel
reading population to a discussion of why using AppArmor by default is
horrible news, or write that yourself? That would seem to be more
constructive than you just showing up after months of discussion
saying it's horrible news.
(If you need to, I can lend you my time machine so you can send the
explantion last year and we can avoid escalating things to the current
stage.)
