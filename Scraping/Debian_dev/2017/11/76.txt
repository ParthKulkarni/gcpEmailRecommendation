 Description     : Limit-raising medium-resolution Doom source port based on Chocolate Doom
Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of Chocolate Doom that provides a higher display
resolution, removes the static limits of the Doom engine and offers further
optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely
config file, savegame, netplay and demo compatibile with the original.
----
Crispy Doom strikes a unique balance between being a traditional Doom engine
(with demo compatibility, and vanilla-engine bug compatibility, etc.) and
offering modern conveniences such as mouse look, nicer resolutions, and small
tweaks and tricks to make the game more interesting and varied (blood colour
for monsters matches their sprites, some static sprites are randomly mirrored
on the vertical axis for more visual variation, etc.)
I will maintain this either via collab-maint or pkg-games, apparently skitt
has expressed an interest in the past and Fabian himself might involve himself
if he wishes to (both would be welcome)
One (other) big difference between crispy and chocolate doom, at least at the
moment, is crispy has been ported to SDL2, which makes it better suited for
platforms or environments where SDL2 has been ported and SDL1 has not.
