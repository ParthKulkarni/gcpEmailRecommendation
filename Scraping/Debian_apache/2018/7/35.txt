Package: apache2
Version: 2.4.33-3
Severity: important
Dear maintainer,
The Debian package includes a debian/gbp.conf which sets some global
options for git-buildpackage. These are very annoying for anyone
willing to rebuild the package. Namely, please remove:
pristine-tar = True
builder = dpkg-buildpackage -i\.git -I.git
upstream-branch=upstream
debian-branch=master
These are typically things that should go in ~/.gbp.conf. Anyone
having a correctly configured sbuild + gbp environment will be very
much annoyed by this debian/gbp.conf. In my experience, there's no
need to ever have a debian/gbp.conf file. For example, the
debian-branch thing can be removed if ~/.gbp.conf contains:
ignore-branch = True
Cheers,
Thomas Goirand (zigo)
