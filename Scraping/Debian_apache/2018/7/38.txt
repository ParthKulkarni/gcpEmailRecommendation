Package: ssl-cert
Version: 1.0.39
Severity: wishlist
The current default keylength for the snakeoil cert is 2048 bits. However,
these certs could now live for ten years (3650 days), which as I type
this could be upto 2028.
Various technical bodies are recently that for long-lived secrets,
a factoring modulus (i.e., RSA key size) of 3072 bits is recommended:

	https://www.keylength.com/en/compare/
2048b should be good until the year 2030, but we're approaching that now:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size#Asymmetric_algorithm_key_lengths
While most commercial certificate authorities (CAs) give out 2048 bit
certficites, those are only valid for 1-2 years (90 days in the case
of Let's Encrypt), so the risk is much less in the short term.
Can "-newkey rsa:3072" be added to the ssl-cert script for better
future proofing?
