Hi,
while updating apache2 to 2.4.34, I found out (or rather users found out) that lbmethod_bybusyness
module now require symbols from mod_proxy.
Unfortunately, because the modules are loaded in alphabetical order, this breaks module loading,
and apache2 ends up with error loading lbmethod_bybusyness due to missing symbol.
The possible solutions:
1. Statically compile mod_proxy in -> I was unsuccessful, because moving ‘proxy’ to static makes
*all* proxy modules including lbmethod_* modules to be compiled statically.  DOESN’T WORK
2. Moving proxy symlink before lbmethod_* or lbmethod_* symlinks after proxy module.  That works
if done manually, but a2enmod and a2query doesn’t have support for priorities.  Adding such support
would require a substantial work in *perl* - because it must not break existing deployments.
I think that in theory, this could be driven by “Depends” field, starting say at “20-“ prefix and increasing
the number by 10 on each “Depends:” iteration.  Unfortunately, I don’t have the time nor the perl-foo
to do that.
Anyway, I just wanted to warn the other maintainers before the 2.4.34 upload.
