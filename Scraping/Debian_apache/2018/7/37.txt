Package: ssl-cert
Version: 1.0.39
Severity: normal
In the make_snakeoil() funtion, the code gets the FQDN of the system
via a call to 'hostname -f'. Then it checks if this the FQDN is longer
than 64 characters, and if it is, uses the short hostname.
However, a FQDN can be up to 255 octets per RFC 1035, Section 2.3.4:
	2.3.4. Size limits
	Various objects and parameters in the DNS have size limits.  They are
	listed below.  Some could be easily changed, others are more
	fundamental.
	labels          63 octets or less
	names           255 octets or less
	TTL             positive values of a signed 32 bit number.
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32290167/
The 64 octet limit is for each sub-component:
	part1.partb.foo.example.com
So the each of "part1", "foo", etc, must less than 64, and the entire
FQDN string must be less than 255.
But that is not what the script is checking: it is seeing if the 
entire FQDN string is less than 64--which is about four times too short.
