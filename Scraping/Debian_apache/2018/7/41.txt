Package: libcap-ng0
Version: 0.7.9-1
Severity: grave
Justification: renders package unusable
Hi,
apache httpd loads and unloads modules during a reload of the server
configuration. This causes the pthread_atfork entry that is installed by
libcap-ng0 to point to code that is no longer in the process, causing a
segfault at the next fork.
See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=902657
There is already an upstream bug report about this:
https://github.com/stevegrubb/libcap-ng/issues/5
Since there is no interface to undo a pthread_atfork() call, there is no
way a shared library can call pthread_atfork() in a safe way. libcap-ng0
should not do it.
Cheers,
Stefan
