Yeah, confirmed that this fixes it. I'm reassigning the bug to tmpreaper.
Summary:
tmpreaper disrupts systemd services using PrivateTmp=true since those are using
a private filesystem namespace which tmpreaper is unaware of. This was noticed
with Apache (which uses PrivateTmp=true in stretch), but should equally apply
to other services.
Supporting these to full extent would either require to add support to tmpreaper to 
support reaping those (or maybe rather add an option to systemd to support similar 
functionality), but I think a good interim solution is to skip those private tmps
in tmpreaper for now.
Steps to reproduce:
- Install apache2
- A "systemctl reload apache2" should work fine
- Add a dummy file to /tmp
- Set TMPREAPER_TIME=1m in /etc/tmpreaper.conf so that the next tmpreaper run removes
  the dummy file
- Wait a minute and run /etc/cron.daily/tmpreaper
- Dummy file should be gone now
- systemctl reload apache2" should work fine should now fail with the error
  "Failed at step NAMESPACE spawning /usr/sbin/apachectl"
Fix:
Since systemd is Debian's default init system and given that PrivateTmp is an increasingly
used option, I'd suggest that it's at least added to the existing directories using
--protect in /etc/cron.daily/tmpreaper.
Maybe also add it to TMPREAPER_PROTECT_EXTRA by default, but I think adding it to
the default cron is the more important change:
