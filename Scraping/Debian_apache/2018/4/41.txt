Dear libapache2-mod-proxy-uwsgi maintainers,
mod-proxy-uwsgi has been donated to the ASF and since version 2.4.33, it is 
included in apache2. Now, as uwsgi builds a bunch of other packages, the 
question is from which source package should the libapache2-mod-proxy-uwsgi 
transitional package be built? Any preferences?
Maybe put it into apache2, then I can remove it when it's no longer necessary?
Cheers,
Stefan
