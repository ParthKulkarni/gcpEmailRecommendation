Hello List,
We are experiencing roughly the same issue since upgrading to deb8u12. I
was searching this ML archive and bumped in this report, happily?.
We noticed that reverting to deb8u11 restores normal behaviour: "apache
reloads" (graceful) work without interruption again.
We have pinpointed this problem in the slotmem_shm module that is
automatically loaded when we use the proxy_balancer. (all done via our
wonderful puppet forge apache module).
The exact log message after graceful restarts in deb8u12:
[Thu Apr 05 16:19:38.963500 2018] [slotmem_shm:error] [pid 18315:tid
140146439718784] (28)No space left on device: AH02611: create:
apr_shm_create(/var/run/apache2/slotmem-shm-pe0653d6a_apidocs_cluster.shm)
failed
[Thu Apr 05 16:19:38.963553 2018] [:emerg] [pid 18315:tid
140146439718784] AH00020: Configuration Failed, exiting
Is this info helpful? Or not at all? Can I assist with providing more
information?
Thanks,
