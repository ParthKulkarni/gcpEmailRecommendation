[updating address for salvaged uwsgi mailinglist]
Excerpts from Stefan Fritsch's message of april 15, 2018 11:14 am:
mod-proxy-uwsgi has been donated to the ASF and since version 2.4.33, it is 
included in apache2. Now, as uwsgi builds a bunch of other packages, the 
question is from which source package should the libapache2-mod-proxy-uwsgi 
transitional package be built? Any preferences?

This is great news!
I find it most sensible for apache2 to provide the transitional package.
