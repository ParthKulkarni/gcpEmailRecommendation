Hi Stefan,
You're absolutely right, I was building the package as root inside a
docker container, mostly as a one-off kind of build to add some
debugging information. I tried using fakeroot instead, and it masked
the problem as you mentioned, as the file at the end still has the
setuid bit, even though it has changed group (and the same happens if
the owner is changed):
jvperrin@fireball:~$ fakeroot /bin/bash
root@fireball:~# touch test.txt
root@fireball:~# ls -l test.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jun  2 13:08 test.txt
root@fireball:~# chmod 4754 test.txt
root@fireball:~# ls -l test.txt
-rwsr-xr-- 1 root root 0 Jun  2 13:08 test.txt*
root@fireball:~# chgrp nogroup test.txt
root@fireball:~# ls -l test.txt
-rwsr-xr-- 1 root nogroup 0 Jun  2 13:08 test.txt*
If I do the same without fakeroot, it loses the setuid bit (as it should):
jvperrin@fireball:~$ sudo -i
root@fireball:~# touch test.txt
root@fireball:~# ls -l test.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jun  2 13:11 test.txt
root@fireball:~# chmod 4754 test.txt
root@fireball:~# ls -l test.txt
-rwsr-xr-- 1 root root 0 Jun  2 13:11 test.txt*
root@fireball:~# chgrp nogroup test.txt
root@fireball:~# ls -l test.txt
-rwxr-xr-- 1 root nogroup 0 Jun  2 13:11 test.txt*
This suggests to me that this is indeed a problem with fakeroot, not
with this package, although I do still think the patch I included on
this bug report could be helpful as it wouldn't change the behavior
when it fakeroot and fixes the issue if anyone else is building
manually outside of fakeroot. Looking at fakeroot's bug reports, it's
already been reported almost a decade ago
(https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=497109). It hasn't
had any activity since then, so that's unfortunate, I'll try and
follow up there. Thank you for your help, that was very useful!
