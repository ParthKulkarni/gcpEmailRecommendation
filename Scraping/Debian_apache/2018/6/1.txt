Package: apache2-suexec-pristine
Version: 2.4.25-3+deb9u4
Severity: normal
Tags: patch
Justification: fails to build from source (but built successfully in the past)
Dear Maintainer,
When building the apache2-suexec-pristine (and apache2-suexec-custom) packages
from source, I expected the built .deb packages to contain setuid binaries
(at /usr/lib/apache2/suexec-pristine and /usr/lib/apache2/suexec-custom
respectively). However, when packaging was done, the packages contained
binaries with the permissions 0754, not 4754, as set in the debian/rules file.
Looking into this more, it appears that chgrp (through the chown system call)
clears the setuid bit (and all bits in the first octet of permissions) when it
is run, so the steps in override_dh_fixperms-arch end up removing the setuid
bit when chgrp is run after chmod.
This appears to be a problem in the source for this package, on the master
branch, as well as on separate branches for different distros:
https://salsa.debian.org/apache-team/apache2/blob/master/debian/rules#L148-153
I'm not sure how this has worked properly to produce packages, since the last
change to that section was 6 years ago, so I'm a bit confused on that point.
Here is a patch to fix the setting of the setuid bit in both packages by just
moving the chmod to after chgrp has already run:
