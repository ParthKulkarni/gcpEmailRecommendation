Source: apr-util
Version: 1.6.1-1
Severity: serious
Tags: patch
Hi,
The apr-util package FTBFS with debhelper/11.1 as it has an empty
build target.  This is caused by debhelper had a bug in its handling
of "explicitly defined rules targets" that has now been fixed.
Previously, this happened to work because dpkg-buildpackage would
invoke "debian/rules build" (which would be a no-op) followed by
"fakeroot debian/rules binary".  During the binary target, dh's
suboptimal handling would run the build commands.
The solution is trivial but less pretty; explicitly define "build"
with the same content as the "%:" target (or rename the "build" folder
and drop the ".PHONY" target).  I have attached a patch for this.
I have also added two optional patches (0002 + 0003) to remove some
redundancy by reducing the number of options passed to dh.  When
apr-util in unstable was rebuilt, they produced bit-for-bit identical
output compared to apr-util in sid (with 0001; I could not built it
without 0001, which is why I am filing the bug).
  Both patches bumps the minimum debhelper version requriement for
building apr-util.  Most likely, it will be a non-issue for you as the
minimum requirements are satisfied in stable and oldstable-backports.
Unfortunately, even after fixing this bug, apr-util FTBFS due to a
test failure[1].  I verified that this test failure also occurs when
building with debhelper/11 and is therefore unrelated to this issue.
However, it meant that all of my builds had to be done with
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck.  I also noted a warning that is probably
unrelated to this test failure but may cause issues as well[2].
More details can be found in:
 * #886901 comment #35
 * #887688 comment #37
 * #880840
Apologies for the inconvenience.
Thanks,
~Niels

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Bump debhelper compat to 10
This enables us to ditch the --parallel option for dh as it is now the
default.
