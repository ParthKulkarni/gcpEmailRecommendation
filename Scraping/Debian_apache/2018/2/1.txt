Source: apr-util
Version: 1.6.1-1
Severity: serious
Block 888751 by -1
Hello, before uploading new gdbm in unstable, I tested all the reverse-dependencies, except for the packages
that were already broken/not building.
This sounds to be the case for this one, and now I don't know how to debug this package.

apr-util seems now part of apr, I don't know why/if this package is still needed.
BTW the build failure can be solved by uncommenting
".PHONY: build" on debian/rules
thanks for helping in finding a fix!
