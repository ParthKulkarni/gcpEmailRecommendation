Dear Maintainer,
even after updating Debian 9.4 today all the errors described at Mon,
2 Apr 2018 still exist. Even worse, after every update of Debian the
workaround described there (replace call of "apache2ctl start" with
"apache2ctl graceful" in /usr/sbin/apache2ctl) is silently
overwritten. This renders several cgi applications useless unless the
workaround is manually restored.
Can i help you somehow? For example, after being instructed, some
basic gdb usage would be possible. From my point of view i would start
here:
$ file /usr/sbin/apache2
/usr/sbin/apache2: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), 
dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 
2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=7c6921f7a97e8753600832689691e71b0e3dc213, stripped
$ /usr/sbin/apache2 -h
Usage: /usr/sbin/apache2 [-D name] [-d directory] [-f file]
...
  -X                 : debug mode (only one worker, do not detach)
$ /usr/sbin/apache2 --help
[Fri May 25 17:05:58.606662 2018] [core:warn] [pid 2480] AH00111: Config 
variable ${APACHE_RUN_DIR} is not defined
apache2: Syntax error on line 80 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: 
DefaultRuntimeDir must be a valid directory, absolute or relative to 
ServerRoot
As far as i can judge the difference between calling any binary with
"-h" or "--help" should never be a strange error message as the one
above, i would take into account, that this could be the symptom of
something _really_ evil. Hopefully it's not.
Regards, Bernd
