If no email is send to inform any of the porters, no one is going
to know that there is an actual bug which needs to be worked on.
The port-specific mailing lists exist for this very reason. You
can't expect us to know about every bug filed on any package
within Debian.
If you have a problem with architecture X, talk to the people
maintaining it.

I'm not sure what the current status here is. James Clarke will know
more. He's been working on bringing these features to Debian Ports. There
is already a transition tracker for Debian Ports:

I can test that. There is also a way to set up your own m68k environment [1].
