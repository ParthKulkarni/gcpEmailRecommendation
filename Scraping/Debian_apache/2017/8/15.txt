We have some websites running on Debian Wheezy, so still using Apache 
2.2.22, that are configured either in Worker or Event MPM (so are using 
mod_cgid in what follows), and have a custom "ErrorDocument 400" 
directive that points at a perl script for providing custom ModSecurity 
error.
I haven't dug up an older version of the package from snapshots to 
confirm this, but I think that since the recently backported 
HttpProtocolOptions directive to that version (BTW, where was that 
announced - I had to run strings on the binary to find it), I've been 
seeing a lot of segfault/coredumps registered in the Apache error logs.
After some analysis, I've found that I can reproduce the error with a 
fairly trivial shell command:
From the coredump, I was able to find that this line (1371) in the 
cgid_handler() code in the modules/generators/mod_cgid.c source file has 
a null pointer issue on the r->protocol field:
No combination of adjustments to the HttpProtocolOptions directive 
seemed to help from what I could see.
I also haven't been able to reproduce this issue on a Prefork MPM 
backend webserver.
Varying the details of the perl ErrorDocument script's implementation 
don't appear to help either (eg: it still occurs even with a simple 
hello world script).
The error still occurs if I disable ModSecurity, but leave the 
ErrorDocument for 400 messages.
Version: 2.2.22-13+deb7u11
The fix has been released in DLA 841-2. Closing the report.
