The debian bts is email based (unless you use the reportbug tool included 
in debian). But I don't think you need to file a report:
I am aware of mod_brotli but we need the brotli library and development 
header files available as a package, first. See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=865523
There seems to be a version of the package in Debian experimental that 
builds the library but we need to wait until that hits Debian unstable.
Cheers,
Stefan
