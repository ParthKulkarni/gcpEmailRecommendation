Not sure if m68k is alive anymore. The build log urls are not reachable 
anymore this bug report is no longer useful. Closing.
I doubt that anyone is interested in debugging m68k issues, I definitely 
don't have any time or motivation to deal with them. But if you think it 
may be useful you may open a new bug with logs of a build of a recent apr 
version.
