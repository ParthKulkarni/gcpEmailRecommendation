Package: apache2-mpm-event
Version: 2.4.10-10+deb8u10
Severity: important
Tags: upstream
i have a slightly off-the-beaten-track setup on a live-running i386 (not amd64)
server which has (had) apache-mpm-event activated using the standard
debian configuration for that module.
there was (is) absolutely NO threading modules enabled or in use with
the exception of google's mod_pagespeed, where the developers inform
me that they do regular testing of mod_pagespeed in both the mpm-event
and mpm-worker configuration
the modules utilised for the main web serving are mod-fcgid (WSGI) and
standard CGI-bin for running PGP (not the normal way to do it but it
works very well with mpm_worker and mpm_event).  the FCGI application
is a python2.7 WSGI web service NOT USING ANY FRAMEWORK.  it uses
absolutely standard python 2.7 modules that come *with* python, such
as the cgi module and other standard HTML-parsing and processing modules,
where absolutely no use of threading is made whatsover.  mysql access
is performed with python-mysqldb, and, again, does not use any threading
of any kind.
unfortunately it is not... convenient... to do experimentation on the
live server.  this is more of an "informational" report that "Something
Bad Happened" - apache2 segfaulted and left the customer completely
without service... twice.... and switching off apache2-mpm-event
and going back to apache2-mpm-prefork "solved" the problem.
it's also worth noting that absolutely no problems whatsoever have been
noted with prefork.  stable as a rock, both before mod_pagespeed was
deployed and after.
