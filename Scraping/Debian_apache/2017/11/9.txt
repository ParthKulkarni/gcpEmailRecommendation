mpm-event based apache has now survived two nightly runs of logrotate
doing '/etc/init.d/apache2 reload' since I ensured it will only do that
once per run.
  So what is it about mpm-event that causes apache2 to crash when
multiple '/etc/init.d/apache2 reload' invocations happen in very quick
succession ?  Smells like an upstream bug, yes ?
  Not that I can seem to reproduce this with:
COUNT=1 ; while [ $COUNT -lt 80 ] ; do ( /etc/init.d/apache2 reload &); COUNT=`expr $COUNT + 1` ; done
  Perhaps it's not just the rapid reloads, but combining those with
needing to create new log files ?
Although it does leave me with only processes like:
	/usr/sbin/apache2 -k graceful
running, rather than the more usual:
	/usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
And some instances of the init.d script complaining "Apache2 is not
running" on subsequent invocations.
