True.

That section only talks about the package scripts (postinst, etc.). I don't 
think it is applicable for logrotate scripts.
The reason I didn't use invoke-rc.d is that it obeys runlevel constraints, 
which is not wanted in the logrotate script. But it seems invoke-rc.d has this 
limitation only for "start", not for "status" and "reload". So switching to 
invoke-rc.d should be fine.
