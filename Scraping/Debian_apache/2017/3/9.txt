Package: apache2
Version: 2.4.25-3
Now that apache2 includes a native systemd unit, it may be prudent to stop assuming that /etc/init.d/apache2 exists. (It's still distributed as part of the package, but since it's a configuration file system administrators are free to delete it.)
The postrotate script in /etc/logrotate.d/apache2 invokes /etc/init.d/apache2 directly; according to section 9.3.3 of the Debian policy it should be using invoke-rc.d instead.
