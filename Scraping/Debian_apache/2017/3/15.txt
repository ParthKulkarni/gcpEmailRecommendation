Hi Julian,
I understand that apache2 is a usually a "prominent" user of mysql
database, but I am inclined to say, that such dependency would be better
placed in the packages that uses 'mysql', as it would be a tedious to
list all possible dependencies (php-fpm, opendnssec with mysql, etc...)
into the mariadb init script, and it all depends on per-system/per-user
needs.
I haven't tested it yet, but perhaps we can investigate whether all
database packages could "Provide: $database" and all such users could do
"Require-Start: $database".
Similar to what postfix do:
$ cat /etc/insserv.conf.d/postfix 
$mail-transport-agent postfix
So having a:
/etc/insserv.conf.d/mysql
$database mysql
and
/etc/insserv.conf/postgresql-9.6
$database postgresql-9.6
might actually help insserv to figure out the right sysvrc script order.
But I might be mistaken whether this would work if more packages has the
'$database' defined.
Ccing apache2 and postgresql maintainers on this one.
Cheers,
