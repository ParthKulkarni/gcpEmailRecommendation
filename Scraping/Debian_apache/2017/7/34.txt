Hi!
First, thank you very much for the detailed bug report, very useful!

Interesting. It would have been useful to see actual configuration
examples, as I had to go through a little bit of digging to reproduce
the issue. Just using cgid or worker is not sufficient - you actually
*do* need a ErrorDocument directive as well. So thanks to providing
those details, but snippets would have helped as well! :)

I'm sorry to hear that. The change was announced in DLA-841-1 back in
February:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2017/02/msg00031.html
If you haven't seen that announcement, you may not be subscribed to the
debian-lts-announce mailing list, in which case I strongly suggest you
subscribe:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/
There was also a lengthy discussion regarding the patchset on the
debian-lts mailing list:
https://lists.debian.org/87fukh7hcq.fsf@curie.anarc.at
Participation to the debian-lts mailing list is not mandatory for LTS
users, however...

This definitely looks like a heading parsing regression caused by
DLA-841-1. I cannot reproduce with a vanilla Apache install.
To reproduce, on wheezy:
 1. apt-get install apache2
 2. create a dummy perl script in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.pl
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
        print "Hello, World.";
 3. make it executable
 4. add this directive, say in /etc/apache2/conf.d/hello
        ErrorDocument 400 /cgi-bin/hello.pl
 5. reload apache (apache2ctl graceful or whatever)
 6. issue the killer request:
        echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.0\n" | nc localhost 80

Definifely.

Good findings. The fun part is that the above patch doesn't apply
because the protocol initialization was just missing. So this is
possibly broader than just 400 errors.
Note that I have tested this in jessie, and it doesn't seem affected, so
the backport for CVE-2016-8743 was done correctly there.
I'll prepare a package to fix this shortly.
