Hi,
the following vulnerability was published for apache2.
CVE-2017-9788[0]:
| In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value
| placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not
| initialized or reset before or between successive key=value
| assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '='
| assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory
| used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially
| confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in
| denial of service.
If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.
