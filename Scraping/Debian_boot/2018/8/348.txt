Comments/Problems:
Installer with 4.16.x kernel failed with network device detection, despite 
4.9.0-n kernels of stretch having proper module, and in fact also the 4.17 kernel in buster.
Installer reported that lvm was not available.
Installer found disk, but after defining a partition size, would not allow any options
beyond FAT16, FAT32, swap, or "do not use"  ... even when the disk was pre-partitioned. 
No option to define a root partition, no option for ext3/4 xfs, btrfs, etc.
Was not able to proceed with installation.
Ended up skipping Buster, rolled back to:
