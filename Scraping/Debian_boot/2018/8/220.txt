You could tweak the bootscript to detect your preferred device-tree and
set "fdtfile" in the /etc/flash-kernel/ubootenv.d hooks, but this
wouldn't get the right device-tree copied into /boot if you have a split
/boot partition; then you would need to create a kernel/initramfs hook
to copy your preferred .dtb into /boot as well, and maybe customize the
bootscript...
As an alternative to flash-kernel, u-boot-menu supports
kernel-version-specific device-trees. It requires configuring
/etc/default/u-boot with some variables that aren't terribly
well-documented, but you can glean them from the script itself. It is a
bit annoying to support a split /boot partition.
You loose the flexibility of boot scripts that flash-kernel would give
you, and it's harder to do one-off commandline entries, but having an
actual menu is nice.
