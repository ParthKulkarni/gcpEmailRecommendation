Thanks Ben.
I'm mostly familiar with the netinst image, and it's what I generally
use to install on real hardware.
I'm less familiar with netboot, but have used it for PXE installs (right?)
What I'm missing is how I can use either of them on a remote KVM VPS,
where I get to see the boot process on some kind of remote console, and
I have the opportunity to provide a bootable ISO, but not much else.
I've tried providing the netinst ISO, and it boots but can't find itself
for installing packages. Is that a matter of the appropriate storage
drivers not being included, or is it the way the VPS provider set up the
virtual CD?
I've used virt-install on my own KVM machines, which I think does
something similar to a netboot, but I'm not sure what exactly (didn't
make much progress reading the source, unfortunately). I can't use that
method exactly, because I don't have raw access to the host machine.
I don't know how I could use netboot in this case, but any suggestions
are welcome.
I think they're using OnApp for managing this, if that helps - at least
that's the name that shows up with the prebuilt templates. I could of
course use their Stretch template, but I'd rather start clean if I can -
and possibly make some custom partitioning and filesystem choices.
Thanks,
Richard
