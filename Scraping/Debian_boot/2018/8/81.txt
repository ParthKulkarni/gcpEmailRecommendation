Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.106
Tags: patch
Since debootstrap 1.0.102, merged-/usr installs are the default, except when installing blacklisted suites.  The blacklist was established in https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap/commit/4a1b3ca, whose commit message says:
    Set non merged-usr release
    
    We do not apply merged-usr until Debian stretch and Ubuntu cosmic.
However, the actual blacklist is (from scripts/gutsy):
    case "$CODENAME" in
        â€¦|quantal|raring|saucy|utopic|vivid|wily|yakkety|zesty|artful|bionic|cosmic)
Note that trusty and xenial are missing.  This causes their installation to fail due to file conflicts in certain packages.
My speculation is that the omission was due to a copy-paste error from line 4 of scripts/gutsy.

Subject: [PATCH] Added trusty and xenial to merged-/usr blacklist
The blacklist should include all Ubuntu releases up to cosmic.
