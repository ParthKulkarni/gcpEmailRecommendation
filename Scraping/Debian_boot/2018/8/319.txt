Hi,
I recently decided to create a preseeded ISO for Debian deployment at 
our lab, and created the final ISO according to the guide at 
https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso. I was able to 
boot the ISO in legacy mode on a VirtualBox VM, and from a thumbdrive on 
real hardware as well. Sadly the guide does not mention how to re-build 
the ISO so that it can be booted in EFI mode.
I pieced together commands for xorriso from various internet sources. I 
added the options
to the xorriso command. The resulting ISO is bootable in both the 
VirtualBox VM and the real hardware. Is this the preferred/correct way 
to create an EFI-bootable ISO?
kind regards,
Christoph
