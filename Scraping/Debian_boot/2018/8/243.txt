Would it be possible to copy /root someplace temporarily during
installation, for example to /home/root if /home is an available file
system or even a RAM-based temporary file system (which won't help
during a kernel panic)?  Then after /root is re-created, files could
get copied back.
Alternatively, if there are files in /root maybe a warning message
could be printed.
I bring this up now in hopes that some change can be made in time for
the buster freeze.
Thank you,
Paul Hardy
