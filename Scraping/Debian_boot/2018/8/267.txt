Hi,
I noticed that the latest upload of console-setup fails to
migrate to testing.
It claims being "uninstallable on amd64", while
https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=console-setup&arch=all&ver=1.185&stamp=1534275854&raw=0
says that the build was successful.
How can I find out what is wrong here?
Holger
