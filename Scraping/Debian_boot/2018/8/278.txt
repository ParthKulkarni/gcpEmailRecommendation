Hi!
I'm guessing you're seeing the following message?
"Some EFI-based systems are buggy and do not handle new bootloaders "
"correctly. If you force an extra installation of GRUB to the EFI removable "
"media path, this should ensure that this system will boot Debian correctly "
"despite such a problem. However, it may remove the ability to boot any other "
"operating systems that also depend on this path. If so, you will need to "
"make sure that GRUB is configured successfully to be able to boot any other "
"OS installations correctly."
If so, that message will be coming from the grub postinst script, but
should *only* be triggered if you're installing grub-efi-$ARCH and you
have a /boot/efi/ tree.Or are you seeing a different message?
