Alternatively, if you're providing the preseed via a url (and I think
for a least some of the other options for preseeding) you can specify
auto=true, which delays these questions until after the preseed file is
available, and thus makes your preseeding work -- this is the purpose of
the various "Automatic Install" options in the boot menus.  They just add
"auto=true" to the default kernel command line.
Cheers, Phil.
