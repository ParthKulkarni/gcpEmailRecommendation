FWIW you could have reassigned (or cloned + reassigned) the bug report
to the libdebian-installer package (best done by cc-ing us).
That's a very good catch, and indeed a rather sad situation. Given the
current size of that Provides line, I fear bumping from 16k to 64k might
only paper over the issue for a while, and that it might come back later
on.
(FWIW, the currently second longest line is 13786 ‚Äúonly‚Äù.)
Cheers,
