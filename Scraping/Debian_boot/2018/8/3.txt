Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.106
Severity: grave
debootstrap fails in docker environment completely by:
- symlinking $TARGET/proc to /proc
- running chroot $TARGET mount -t proc none /proc
The later obviously failing with a recursive symlink:
| mount: mount proc on /proc failed: Too many levels of symbolic links
I have no idea what this detection is about, but if you are going to run
chroot, you have to also mount /proc.
Regards,
Bastian
