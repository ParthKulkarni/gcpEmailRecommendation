Package: os-prober
Version: 1.76~deb9u1
Severity: normal
File: grub2
Dear Maintainer,
I have had a hard day tryng to make my systems boot again after what apparently was a too big grub.cfg file, of like 7Mb, with many sub menu entrys of 
other grub.cfg files of other partitions.
I have  4 partitions with testing and stable branchs, i386 and amd64.
I was testing each Os and reinstalled grub from almost all of them, in a period of months, to make the default system I was testing too boot by default.
After the last automatic update-grub from a kernel update I think, the grub boot menu just not appeared anymore.
So i had to use a live dvd to enter the system and delete the big file and replace it with a small one, because re running update'grub again give me another big file.
.
Also i had to remove all other grub.cfg files, to uodate the grub normally again.
an additional difficulty was the fact that the DVD live distro  was old and did not let me mount the partitions.
Hope this helps.
