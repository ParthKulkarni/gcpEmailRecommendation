Dear Maintainer,
Installing 9.3.0 via Net Install CD.
At the network detection stage, it found two network interfaces.
I selected one interface, and it allocated an address via DHCP.
My machine is intended to have a static IP, but I couldn't see an option to enter an IP once DHCP had succeeded.
It would be useful to be able to choose not to use DHCP, or to override the DHCP settings.
