OK. Found the issue. Apparently, packages in the */debian-installer
components were being skipped when the BTS was figuring out what was in
which distribution. I've fixed that now, and the versions database is
being updated with that information.
The underlying issue should show up as fixed once the version graph for
this bug looks sane. [Probably in another 10-20 minutes.]
