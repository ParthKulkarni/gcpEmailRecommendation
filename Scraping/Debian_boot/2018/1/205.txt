Both look good to me, and I've verified that rebuilding cryptsetup from
experimental against them leads to appropriate dependencies. Side notes:
generally we don't have any Pre-Depends in udebs AFAICT, so that part
could have been stripped out of the udeb stanza. Also, a single-line
“long” description is usually sufficient. Nothing too dramatic, though. :)
For reasons I'm not going to debug right away, d-i insists on using
cryptsetup and libcryptsetup4 from unstable even though I've tried to
use the rebuilt one instead; as a result, I can't confirm a complete
installation works fine. Feel free to poke me once all bits are out of
NEW and available in sid though, so that we can double check everything
works fine.
Thanks for the patches!
Cheers,
