As announced last month, I've started working on this again these days,
and I've pushed to alioth:
 - stretch-backports-v0 for net-retriever: it doesn't yet implement said
   “policy” but at least the patches got refreshed against current(ish)
   master.
 - stretch-backports-v1 for debian-installer: there are two successive
   parts in there, one for master (implementing new features), and one
   for stretch-backports (actually using those new features).
I'll probably add patches for two other components:
 - apt-setup: so that it auto-enables backports when it detects that
   it's required.
 - finish-install: so that it installs linux-image-$arch from the
   backports suite in the end, to complement the one installed by
   base-installer.
FTR, base-installer happens way before apt-setup, so it's easier and
more convenient to let it install the stable kernel first, then
configure apt and install another kernel from stable-backports
afterwards; than it is to rework the whole installation proces.
Hopefully I'll be able to finish preparing this during next week, and
I'll coordinate with debian-cd and appropriate infrastructure teams for
the extra requirements.
Cheers,
