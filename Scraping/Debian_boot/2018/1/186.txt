Dear Debian Install System Team,
while doing MIA houskeeping work, I came across the package discover.
From here it does look quite a bit neglected, last non-NMU upload in
2015 and thre is also a SEGV bug reported since 4 months without
follow up.
Note that there are four uploaders listed, but one uploader asked to be removed
#848424 and one has retired (#847266), so there is only David and
Petter (which bith did not do any uploads recently and David not even having
a valid key in the keyring)
I'd appreciate it if you could briefly respond whether discover is still
actively maintained by the team or if it should be RFA'd or if you agree
that it is not orphan the package.
Thanks!
