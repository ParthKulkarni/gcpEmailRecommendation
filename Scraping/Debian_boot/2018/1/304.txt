apbs03  is appendix B  section 3
Appendix B is "Automating the installation using preseeding"
Section 3 is "Creating a preconfiguration file"
 
Having a preseed file makes is it possible
to _not_ using a front end.

What I want to contribute to this discussion:
https://superuser.com/questions/48783/how-can-i-pass-an-environment-variable-through-an-ssh-command
There are warnings/notions about ssh-client wants,
must be allowed by the ssh-server.
When it is all fine at SSH level,
then there _might be_ the dragon of DEBIAN_FRONTEND not being check,
just being set to 'newt'  :-(

If succesfull, please report here also.
Thing is the two mailinglists have different audience.
debian-user is roughly for "it works, but how get it working"
debian-boot is for development of debian-installer.
Where I understand that newt frontend is a good default for SSH installs,
do I see several reasons for text frontend as a nice to have.
* no mis match in charcter sets between install target and ssh client.
   ( getting lots of question marks where lines or corner symbols are )
* when CPU-cycles are expensive, don't waste then on newt formatting
* getting output from the install client that is easier parsed then newt output,
  so making automation easier. ( IIRC there is HTTP frontend for automation,
  however SSH gives encrypted transmission )
Long story short:
 I think this a debian-installer  development question.
 Please keep debian-boot@l.d.o. in the loop.
