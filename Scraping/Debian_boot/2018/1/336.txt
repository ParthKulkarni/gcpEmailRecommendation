You have a number of options:
Drop a file in /etc/flash-kernel/ubootenv.d:
  setenv rootflags 'subvol=@'
  setenv bootargs ${bootargs} rootflags=${rootflags}
You could edit /etc/default/flash-kernel:
  LINUX_KERNEL_CMDLINE="quiet rootflags=subvol=@"
You could edit the bootscripts in /etc/flash-kernel/bootscripts/* or
create a custom boot script and edit /etc/flash-kernel/db to use that
bootscript for your board.
Hopefully that solves your issue.
