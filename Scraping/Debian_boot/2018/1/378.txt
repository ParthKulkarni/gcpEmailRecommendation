I went for "installer-team" in the end. If people feel strongly about
it, I'm sure we can get it renamed before we start using it properly.

I have added the following people to the project as members:
{ Alioth Role / Position } => { GitLab Role }
Admin => Owner
Senior Developer => Master
Developer => Developer
I haven't added "Junior Developers" yet because I'm not convinced that
GitLab has an equivalent. The next level down from Developer is
Reporter. Shall I just add Junior Developers as Developers?
I also haven't added Translators. Should they also be Developers?
Alternatively, we can create a sub-team for translators if finer-grained
access to repos is required.
Notes:
- I (bootc) am listed as an Owner because I created the team. I can't
  demote myself. I'm happy to be demoted, but it might be best to do
  that after I've migrated the remaining users.
- I haven't made any attempt to add -guest users, even those who might
  now be Debian Developers but who stuck with their -guest accounts on
  Alioth.
- I haven't been able to add the various DD (emeritus) people who are
  still on the Alioth project, for hopefully obvious reasons.
Please let me know your thoughts about the above, I'm more than happy to
continue the manual work of importing people into the project.
Cheers,
Chris
