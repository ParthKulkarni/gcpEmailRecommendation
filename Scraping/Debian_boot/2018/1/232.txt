Hi,
I just did a new installation using the current (daily) "Debian testing netinstaller".  Furthermore, I've chosen Plasma as desktop and (apart from that) did a default installation _without_ print server.
Then I installed "print-manager" without cups (via "apt install --no-install-recommends print-manager").
The result is (imho) satisfying as trying to configure a printer results in a message, saying that a "Print service is unavailable".  Please see attachment.
I think, if a user chooses to install a desktop environment, he expects to have a convenient tool -- like "print-manager" (in case of Plasma) -- to setup a potential printer later on.
If he has decided to also install a print server during the installation process, then everything works as expected from the beginning.  If not, than _at least_ he has a comfortable entry point (at a self-explaining location), which tells him that an additional service needs to be installed.
So, please consider to add "print-manager" (e.g. without recommendations) to the default installation of Plasma desktop.  In case that no print server is available, it does not lead to a crash -- instead it provides the user with helpful information.  :-)
Thanks a lot for your great work...
