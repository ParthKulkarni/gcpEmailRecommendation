Was performing a Net install of Debian 9.3.0 ADM64.
Have an apt-cache-ng proxy running on a local machine.
DNS record for the apt-cache-ng machine was pointing to an old, and unreachable IP address.
During installation, once I'd entered the proxy address, the installation appeared to start.  The progress bar got to half-way and stayed there for a long time.  There was no indication that an error had occurred.
After half an hour, I investigated and found that it has not connected to the proxy.
The DNS name in the proxy URL resolved to an old address.  It appeared (from ps) that it was sat running 'wget'.
It would be useful if there was a quick test to make sure that the debian mirror could be reached via the proxy, before the download is attempted.
