Package: cdebconf-gtk-terminal
Version: 0.31
Severity: serious
Tags: sid buster
User: pkg-gnome-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org
Usertags: oldlibs vte
cdebconf-gtk-terminal Depends and Build-Depends on vte. In fact, it's
now the only package keeping vte in Debian Testing. The Debian GNOME
team does not intend to release Debian 10 "Buster" with vte since the
old 0.28 series has not had a release since GNOME3's release in 2011.
Please port to the vte2.91 source. That also means porting to gtk3.
gtk3 was declared stable over a year ago with the 3.22 series. (There
also have not been any gtk2 maintenance releases
since that time, although I guess someone will do a gtk2 maintenance
release eventually this year.)
On behalf of the Debian GNOME team,
Jeremy Bicha
