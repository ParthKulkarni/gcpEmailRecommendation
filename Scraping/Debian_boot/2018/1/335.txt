I didn't use blkid, but added support for PARTUUID in 3.69, and just
added support for PARTLABEL in git.
I don't think flash-kernel should use blkid in the way that
initramfs-tools is using it, as initramfs-tools uses blkid at boot time,
and the flash-kernel code is run at initramfs creation
time... hard-coding the specific device at that point doesn't seem like
the right approach.
That said, it was really quite simple to add:
# Translate LABEL, UUID, PARTLABEL and PARTUUID entries into a proper
# device name.
case "$rootdev" in
		LABEL=* | UUID=* | PARTLABEL=* | PARTUUID=*)
			rootdev="$(blkid -l -t "$rootdev" -o device)"
		;;
		*=*)
			echo "/etc/fstab parse error; cannot recognize root $rootdev" >&2
			rootdev=/dev/sda2
			echo "guessing that the root device is $rootdev" >&2
		;;
esac
But it ends up hard-coding, for example, ROOT="/dev/sda3" into the
initramfs, which isn't really correct. The blkid resolution should be
resolved at boot, in initramfs-tools.
I think the current code is actually safer, as it doesn't depend on
device ordering remaining static at boot:
# Translate LABEL, UUID, and PARTUUID entries into a proper device name.
if echo "$rootdev" | grep -q "="; then
	a=$(echo "$rootdev" | cut -d "=" -f 1)
	b=$(echo "$rootdev" | cut -d "=" -f 2- | sed -e 's/^"\(.*\)"$/\1/')
	case "$a" in
		LABEL)
			c=$(echo "$b" | sed 's#/#\\x2f#g')
			if [ -e /dev/disk/by-label/$c ]; then
				rootdev="/dev/disk/by-label/$c"
			else
				echo "Label $b not found in /dev/disk/by-label" >&2
			fi
		;;
		UUID)
			rootdev=/dev/disk/by-uuid/$b
			if [ ! -e $rootdev ]; then
				echo "UUID $b doesn't exist in /dev/disk/by-uuid" >&2
			fi
		;;
		PARTUUID)
			rootdev=/dev/disk/by-partuuid/$b
			if [ ! -e $rootdev ]; then
				echo "PARTUUID $b doesn't exist in /dev/disk/by-partuuid" >&2
			fi
		;;
		PARTLABEL)
			rootdev=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/$b
			if [ ! -e $rootdev ]; then
				echo "PARTLABEL $b doesn't exist in /dev/disk/by-partlabel" >&2
			fi
		;;
		*)
			echo "/etc/fstab parse error; cannot recognize root $rootdev" >&2
			rootdev=/dev/sda2
			echo "guessing that the root device is $rootdev" >&2
		;;
	esac
fi
Although, older kernels or older versions of udev may not support the
/dev/disk/by-* symlink...
It might be worth exploring just passing ROOT="$rootdev" without any
modification, and let initramfs-tools resolve it appropriately.
