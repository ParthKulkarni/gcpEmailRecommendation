Dear Maintainer,
Installing 9.3.0 via Net Install CD.
At the network detection stage, it found two network interfaces.
Both interfaces had the same driver listed, so there was no obvious way to tell which was which.
I selected the first one, and got a DHCP address.
It would beneficial for the installer to:
  a) display the IP address/DNS/gateway that were found
  b) allow the user to unconfigure that interface to select the other
  c) get an address on each interface, and then decide which one to use
  d) allow an advanced user to mix settings
This can be resolved by dropping into a command prompt and using 'ip' to reconfigure the interface, but this is not ideal for many users.
