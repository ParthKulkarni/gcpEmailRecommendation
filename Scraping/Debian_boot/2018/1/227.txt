Hi,
There are new issues with your udebs:
 - libdns-export169-udeb and libisc-export166-udeb now depend on
   liblmdb0, which isn't a udeb.
 - that makes other udebs uninstallable, including isc-dhcp-client-udeb.
Probably an issue since bind9 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6, but you seem to have
performed 4 uploads in less than 12 hours, and our automated tools don't
have a sufficient granularity to pinpoint the exact revision for sure.
Cheers,
