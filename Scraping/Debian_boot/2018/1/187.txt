It's complicatedâ€¦ Some threads where it's discussed:
  https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2015/07/msg00052.html
  https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2017/12/msg00034.html
Long story short: until it's (maybe) replaced, it probably should be
maintained by people aware of d-i specific thingsâ€¦ I'm not sure whether
an RFA would help here. Keeping the (strange, to say the least) status
quo with debian-boot@ as Maintainer might be the easiest way?
Cheers,
