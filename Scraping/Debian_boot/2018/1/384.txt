Hi bind9 people,
I've just gotten this:

I happened to have missed its unstable counterpart, because those come in
batches, depending on the current buildd status of packages. I thought the
“Newly-broken” packages for armel, mips, and mipsel were an artifact of
late builds.
I don't know anything about this libatomic1; but from a look at the 0013
patch, it seems to be a need for a platform rather than for a feature…
Anyway, I'm not sure what to do with isc-dhcp-client-udeb; it's getting
broken on a regular fashion, and its purpose was mainly for non-Linux
ports AFAICR.
I'm not sure how BSD is doing these days; maybe hurd is the only user
left?
Cheers,
