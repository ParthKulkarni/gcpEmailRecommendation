We do handle your use case, but it's probably not very obvious that we
do.
The way you do it is (IIRC) that you select the <BACK> button after DHCP
has succeeded, at which point you should be given the option to
configure the network, and when you select that you should be presented
with more options.
Alternatively, if you're quick you can select <Cancel> while the DHCP
attempt is occurring.
Another option that generally works is to simply do the install, using
the DHCP allocated IP address, and then reconfigure the system to your
requirements after it is up and running.
The reason we don't offer the prompt you were hoping for by default is
that most people on networks with working DHCP want to use it, and
quite often are not familiar enough with the technical terms to be able
to answer the question we'd have to ask.
You can also get the prompt you want by selecting an "Expert" install,
but then you'll also get prompted with all the other questions on other
subjects that we have decided are not important enough to bother normal
users with.
HTH
If that addresses your concerns, please close the bug.
If there is some place where you think placing the documentation about
the Back/Cancel bits would have been seen by you, and hence would have
allowed you to work out how to do it yourself, please make a suggestion.
Cheers, Phil.
