Sorry for taking so long. I suspect the patches were so simple everyone
else expected everyone else to deal with it. There are a *lot* of boards
supported by flash-kernel, and many people tend to simply stratch their
own itch.
I've pushed your patches to git:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/git/d-i/flash-kernel.git/commit/?id=46f22e156d505b08c51545c2c414ca60dd9f92ef
  https://anonscm.debian.org/git/d-i/flash-kernel.git/commit/?id=468b5210d5760d5e28f2172261a375d3c78d6061
So they should be included in the next upload.
I had meant to review weather it would make sense to simply switch
wandboard to uboot-generic... additionally, there is another more
complicated patch series that would make it easier to include portions
From other scripts that would have been useful for this:
  https://bugs.debian.org/884003
But no sense further entangling your simple patches up with this one.
