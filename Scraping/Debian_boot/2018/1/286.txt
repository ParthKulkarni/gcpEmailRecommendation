Dear Maintainer,
I was installing Debian 9.3.0 Net Install.  
I wrote the ISO to a USB stick, but it wouldn't boot correctly (not sure if it was the computer, ISO or the tool used to burn it).
I burned the ISO to a CD and booted from that.  It booted well enough to run the installer, but there some disk read errors.
When it got the 'base install' section, it reported that it couldn't find any media, so couldn't continue.
I was unable to find a suitable method for instructing it to use the USB stick (which contained a copy of the same files as on the CD).
It would be useful to be able to point to an alternate file source at this point.
For example, it would allow the user to have 1 bootable CD burned, but keep updating new images onto the USB.
