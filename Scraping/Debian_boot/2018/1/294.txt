Hi Luca,
Re -cd, I don't expect that to cause any issues. The priority there
might make a difference in terms of where wget will appear on
installation media, but I doubt it. wget is already *way* up the
popcon list so will be near the beginning anyway.
However, for my own safety in the debian-cd *package*. I've just
upgraded from Recommends: to Depends: for wget.
