I think we can document the limitations of our current update procedure.

Can you file a wishlist bug suggesting this so that a more concrete
proposal can be hashed out with the unattended-upgrades maintainers ?

Besides service reloading, and a way to skip breaking upgrades, what else
would be needed so that you don't call it a "crude hack"?

I don't see the relationship. This is really a question of documentation
and of setting the expectations straight.

We certainly don't want to make it more complex for you, we just want more
people to benefit from your work, all those that are not paying attention
at all on the cloud servers that they brought up and then forgot about
when they were doing what they were supposed to do.

OK, putting team@security in copy now. I would like to hear the opinion of
other team members. Do you all agree with what Moritz said? Do you expect
more work for the security team just because we enable unattended-upgrades
by default? What kind of problems do you foresee?
At this point, if you all agree that this needs to be reverted, then you
will have to open a new bug report making your case. It would be even
better if you filed bugs against unattended-upgrades so that there is a
chance that the tool grows the missing features.
For the actual decision of reverting this default value, IMO we should
wait until later in the buster cycle, just to see if your concerns about
unattended-upgrades are fixed and to see how this works out in practice
(although the lack of security updates for testing makes it a bit
pointless as an experiment).
