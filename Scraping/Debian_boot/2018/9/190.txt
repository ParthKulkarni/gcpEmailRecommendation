Hi,
partman-basicfilesystems:
Several translators have translated values, which need to be left untranslated
(question for typical usage of filesystems). I have fixed the translations 
already in the previous upload.
There was already a comment in the templates file explaining this fact
( Do not translate "news", "largefile" and "largefile4". ), but that
comment didn't make it to the po files, because of wrong order in the templates
file. I have fixed this today with
https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/partman-basicfilesystems/commit/32c69cc3ebef4d4082a648cc7a92d10266d4f2ad
Additionally: according to the templates file, they should be in 2, but they are 
in 1, because of the missing " :sl2: " comment.
So, the strings will/should move from sublevel1 to 2 with the next l10n-sync
run.
Just for your information
Holger
