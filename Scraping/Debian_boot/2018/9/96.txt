Hi,
I had posted on 'debian-accessibility' the below e-mail but didn't gain 
much traction there.
 When installing Debian with speach the volume of the voice is not loud 
enuf even when using espeakup command to increase the volume.
That makes it "hard" to hear properly when you are not in a quiet 
environment.
They don't need the accessibility feature(s) to be installed or enabled 
at boot.
This prompt could be available when the kernel boot parameter 'priority' 
is set to 'low'.
In other words, using accessibility at install time does not mean that 
accessibility should be enabled/installed on the installed system.
If you have more questions do not hesitate to ask them! :)
