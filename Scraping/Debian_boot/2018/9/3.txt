Greetings all,
System76 support informs me they have successfully reproduced the issue on a
machine with hardware identical to mine, meaning this is likely a hardware
compatibility issue and not a faulty hardware issue.
I would like to imagine if we can just figure out the proper boot paramaters
here, the installer will just work, but I am out of my wheelhouse here and could
use some help.
In an attempt to unblock myself, I went ahead and set up a debian live USB
planning to do a manual install with debootstrap and, surprise surprise, the
live USB image also has a debian-installer style boot menu, and exhibits the
exact same behavior as the installer does, so I cannot boot into a live debian
system from the USB images either.  I'm trying to create an ubuntu live thumb
drive now so I can run debootstrap from there...
Thanks!
-Carl
