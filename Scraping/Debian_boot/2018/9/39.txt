Not what I meant (but I certainly could've been clearer).
Autodetecting a proxy using the WPAD scheme is complicated, and I agree
that adding a Javascript interpreter to apt just so we can figure out
where a proxy can be found is probably way overkill. It might be nice,
but I don't think we should do it.
However, it would be nice if a network administrator could somehow
suggest a closeby *mirror*. That's why I said "something not unlike" in
the above quote. Since this'd be something we'd be creating ourselves,
we can decide that no scripting language would be necessary, but instead
just a simple configuration file that says "if you're looking for a
mirror for something of which the Release file has fields matching
<xyz>, please go to <URL>".
