Package: pkgsel
Version: 0.45
Tags: security
Severity: important
Security updates (and point releases) may include ABI bumps and new
binary packages for some source packages that don't have a stable ABI. 
In particular, linux has done this several times this year; KiBi
suggested that bind9 might sometimes do this.
Normally the installer will install a metapackage such as linux-image-
amd64, and a subsequent "apt upgrade" or "apt-get dist-upgrade" will
update this package and pull in the new kernel package.  Similarly
upgrades to bind9 will pull in the new library packages.
However, pkgsel by default runs "apt-get upgrade" which does *not* pull
in new packages as dependencies.  There is a debconf question
(pkgsel/upgrade) for what type of upgrade to do, but it's low priority,
and this is surely the wrong default behaviour.
I think that either the default for this question should be changed to
"full-upgrade", or the implementation of "safe-upgrade" should be
changed to "apt upgrade".  This installs new packages as dependencies
but doesn't remove anything.  I don't know if it's possible to get the
same behaviour through options to "apt-get".
Ben.
