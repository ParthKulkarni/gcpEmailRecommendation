dict and trans-de-en are no packages for the average desktop user IMO
(dict has a CLI client and an old-school xterm client, and trans-de-en itself
is most likely of very little use), so they should removed from the task.
doc-linux: several doc-linux-* packages have been removed from the archive
in the past 7 years, so an update is needed:
	doc-linux-de: 	no longer in the archive
	doc-linux-hr:	no version in the archive since jessie
	doc-linux-it: 	no longer in the archive
	
Objections against me committing the above?
Holger
