Indeed.  The use of Javascript makes WPAD implementation quite risky. 
There are other dangers in implementating WPAD; for example see
<https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-144A>.
It could be useful, and maybe even worth enabling by default, if it was
supported in all (or at least most) of the different HTTP libraries we
ship.  But I don't think we're anywhere near there, so supporting it at
installation time only doesn't seem worth the trouble.
