Package: installation-reports
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
   * What led up to the situation?
doing a dist-upgrade from debian7 to debian8
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or ineffective)?
# apt-get upgrade
editing  /etc/apt/sources.list changing instances of "wheezy" to "jessie"
# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
# apt-get dist-upgrade
# apt-get autoremove
reboot
   * What was the outcome of this action?
system boots a newly installed 3.16.0-6-686-pae kernel but gets stuck on a BusyBox initramfs prompt
kernel 3.2.0-6-686-pae from previous distribution works fine
kernel/initrd files copied form a working debian8 that was installed from scratch with CD on an identical machine boots fine too
if update-initramfs -u is ran to update the initrd, the resulting initrd file makes the system in the same unbootable state
when at initramfs prompt, it is possible to
-activate LVM with vgchange -ay
-mount and access the root partition
However, ussing the "exit" command ends up in a kernel panic, root filesystem being mounted on /root or not
the last lines in the console:
done.
Target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init.
Begin: Running /scripts/local-bottom ... done.
Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ... mount: Mounting /dev on /root/dev failed
: No such file or directory
doe.
No Init found. Try passing init= bootarg.

   * What outcome did you expect instead?
system run with newly installed distribution and its kernel/initrd flawlessly
