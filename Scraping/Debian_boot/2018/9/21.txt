Thank you for your quick and clear answer Philipp, this is greatly appreciated.
Yes, I worked purely through the installer's UI, and I do not have a copy of the LUKS header.
So, using cryptsetup to change the new passphrase back to the old one will not help me to successfully decrypt any of my data in that volume (because it will not lead to the same key material). Correct? Ouch...
Are there any other options I could try?
After I've recovered from this problem, I will file a feature request for partman: (a) detecting previously encrypted volumes; (b) requesting to mount previously-encrypted volumes with their passphrase and/or include a warning when proceeding to overwrite the LUKS header.
Thanks again & keep up the good work caring for our beloved Debian
