Package: console-setup
Version: 1.185
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
I copied linux from a 20-yr old disk to a brand new one 100 times as large
in GB.  But what I copied is only 2-3 years old so I updated it using
aptitude and have several problems, one of which I'll describe here.  The
old disk used sysvinit and the large font got installed ok on boot.  But
now I use systemd and get only a tiny font at login. Once logged in as
root I can type "setupcon" and all is Ok.  With journalctl I checked what
console-setup.service did at boot.  It ran twice. one sec. apart and
Starting and Started console font and keymap. But no change in fonts.
