I had just grabbed the latest di-sources.list to use on an older version

It's sort of a nice feature, it makes using a local mirror/proxy easier 
(assuming you know you can use that). But I suspect most mirrors would 
have a debian/ dir and if a user had one that _didn't_ then the regexp 
could be setup the other way to strip it out.
So my vote would be fix the URLs in di-sources.list, comment out 
MIRROR_REGEXP in the conf, change it's regexps to provide an example of 
how it could be used.
I guess the only concern is the existing conffiles that are out there 
and if that would break existing installs. If you changed both sources 
and conf at the same time, hopefully it would be clear. I guess if you 
go that route, wait until one of them needs another change anyway?
