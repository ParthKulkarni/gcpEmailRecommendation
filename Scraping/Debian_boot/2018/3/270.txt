Configuring APTsources...
Preparing linux-image-4.9.0-6-amd64...
Then ERROR
"Unable to install the selected kernel
An error was returned while trying to install the kernel into the target system.
Kernel package: 'linux-image-amd64'.
Check /var/log/syslog or see virtual console 4 for the details.
"
Note: I am fairly inexperienced installing a Debian instance - so
chances are I have done something incorrectly, though I read right
through the installation guide and I don't think I have missed
something obvious. Have tended to follow the 'recommended' set-up as
indicated in the GUI installer.
Thanks and regards,
Charles
