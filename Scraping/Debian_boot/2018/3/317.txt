These files are non-free firmware (https://wiki.debian.org/Firmware). 
You can get an alternate installation image that includes this firmware
from
https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/
Note that Debian 7 is now nearly 5 years old and will only be supported
for a few more months.  I strongly recommend that you install Debian 9
instead.
