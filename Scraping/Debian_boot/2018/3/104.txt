Hello,
I have noticed that Georgian is not enabled in d-i in textmode, event
when font switch support is available.  I have attached screenshots
of the first question.  I can't read Georgian :) so I don't know if
something looks wrong on the text side, but with a foreigner look it
looks good, what do you think?  I have uploaded to
https://people.debian.org/~sthibault/tmp/mini-i18n.iso
a test image which defaults to the textmode installation, could georgian
people try it and check that the rendering is correct?  (except the first
screen, at which font switch expectedly hasn't happened yet)
