Hello. as far as I know now it is impossible to make installation using 
text mode and speakup with espeakup in Russian.
if I'm not mistaken this is because espeakup does not support unicode. 
in the git I saw a commit correcting this. my question is: after the 
release of  espeakup will it be able to work with the Russian text. and 
whether the problem with installation in Russian will be solved.
Sincerely, Alexander
