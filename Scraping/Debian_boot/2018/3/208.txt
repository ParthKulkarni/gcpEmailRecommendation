I have a reasonably typical install of Stretch currently.
Please note subject line of "Finding installer documents to facilitate 
an *ATYPICAL* install", especially the emphasized word.
I wish to install all required packages such that I could run all 
portions of the installer from my current partition with another 
partition of the same disk being the destination *WITHOUT* any reference 
to any network nor *read only media*.
My underlying motivation is the routinely available installers (netinst 
or DVD) install too much/little. For my personal use the combination of 
installing a base command line system with some preseeded items meets 
most of my needs.
For a particular small audience, I believe that there is a more optimal 
mixture of defaults and questions to be asked.
I'm looking for a document that expands on that. It would likely be at 
least 3 to 4 pages long. It would lead to determining all packages 
required and how to launch. It would give me enough background to 
determine what I [do]/[do not] know.
The immediate goal is to run the installer from the local machine is 
such a manner that the operator can not distinguish it from running from 
a CD/DVD (a Turing Test of sorts).
