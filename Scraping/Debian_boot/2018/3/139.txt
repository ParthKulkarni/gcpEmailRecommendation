Hi,
We need changes in this package to help to bootstrap the riscv64 architecture,
in particular it will help to skip using doxygen (in a clean way) for the time
being.
It will be available at some point in the future, but it's complicate to have it
in the initial stages, due to the build-depends needed (particularly
yui-compressor and ruby-compass at this moment).  This is probably the case for
any other architecture being bootstrapped now or in the near future.
I am attaching a patch that makes possible to compile the package by using
profiles (or options) "nodoc", avoiding the dependency in d/control (with
profile) and avoiding those files.  The profile helps to avoid the
build-dependency entirel, not needing to force to build with missing
dependencies.
Besides that, "nodoc" is a standard build option that would be nice to have in
any case.
Please consider applying the patch (that I will upload in minutes, to have a bug
number) or providing some alternative solution to the same effect.
Thanks and cheers.
