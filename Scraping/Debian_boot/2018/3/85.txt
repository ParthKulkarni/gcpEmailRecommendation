The problem is not specific to Tajik !!!
It seems there is something generic broken in the installer.
A screenshot of the languagechooser screen is attached, where several broken
characters can be seen (in Arabic, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech and
Greek, for example). Please also note the broken alignment of the right frame 
border.
This seems however be limited to the text-based installer.
The graphical installer looks fine here.
So, Victor, you can use the graphical installer frontend, to check your translations.
(At least for me it looks fine with qemu. See the second screenshot attached.)

Your latest ISO-codes changings have not been uploaded yet.
