Hm, the /debian/ should be inserted by the following in
'/etc/di-netboot-assistant/di-netboot-assistant.conf' [1]:
   #Download Mirror
   # The variable MIRROR_REGEXPS contain a list of space separated sed
   # regular expression, to rewrite di-sources.list URLs, to match your
   # prefered mirror.  For example:
   MIRROR_REGEXPS="s=://deb.debian.org/=://deb.debian.org/debian/="
I was already wondering why not to use the correct URL in
'di-sources.list', but kept that as it works fine for me.  Can you
check if you have the line in 'di-netboot-assistant.conf'?  Perhaps
it's there for historical reasons and we can/should remove it.
Best regards,
  Andi
