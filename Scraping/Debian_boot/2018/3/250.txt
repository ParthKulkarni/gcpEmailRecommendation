Sorry for this regression.
I confirm if building under stretch, 20080615-20 is fine, without
depending on libfl2.
So obviously it's because the new flex package in unstable, 2.6.4-6.
If building the previous version, 20080615-19, under unstable, I guess
it would have the same result.
Now we need the fix.
Do you have any suggestion, except adding udeb support to package flex?
Cheers,
