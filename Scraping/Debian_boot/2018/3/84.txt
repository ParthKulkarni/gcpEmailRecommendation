Dear All,
It looks like something went wrong with Tajik characters for Debian-installer.
Could you please, help to resolve the issue. Please, see the attached capture with broken characters.
Also, It looks like Tajik translations for Country names and Timezone have not been applied to the latest iso image to check. I use this one (GTK) for tests: https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/i386/daily/netboot/gtk/
Should check Tajik translations for Country names and Timezone from the other source or iso build?
Thank you for prompt reply,
Victor
