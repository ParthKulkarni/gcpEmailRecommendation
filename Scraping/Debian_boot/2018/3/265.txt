hi,
i tried to run the installer from within a live system with preseeds and 
then to reboot the live system and everything automatically. i got it as 
far as the installer proceed to finish the installation main-menu item.
when looking at what happened, it went to 
/lib/live/installer/usr/lib/finish-install.d/99reboot from there to 
/lib/debian-installer/exit and /lib/debian-installer/exit-command and 
/lib/debian-installer/exit will try to unmount, swapoff, and so and then 
to reboot. that fails and the main-menu reduces priority and goes to 
finish the installation main menu itme again waiting for user input and 
failing thereby to complete the automatic installation.
however, i guess some piece of code like di-utils-reboot.postinst (see 
[1] or [2]) would actually achieve the installer to exit automatically. 
but /lib/debian-installer/exit and /lib/debian-installer/exit-command 
know only three possibilities: reboot, halt, and poweroff. i have no 
clue how this really fits together. Is there possibly something missing 
or not optimally aligned and in fact kind of a bug or do i try something 
not supported or in the wrong way?
i admit i haven't even found out what exact version of all the 
components involved i'm using. recently downloaded from debian stretch 
apt repository. now i tried to include exit as a fourth "finish" command 
in /lib/debian-installer/exit-command and /lib/debian-installer/exit 
like this:
i hope one can understand the patch-like notation. a first try to change 
it like this showed that it actually exited the installer. for that 
experiment though i had to change the scripts while the installer was 
running. packaging such a change would be another step. what i still 
don't understand is how this fits into the big picture with 
di-utils-reboot.postinst (see [1] or [2]) where the code i hoped for is 
actually there but i just can't get it executed automatically. more 
elegant even would probably be to replace the content of 99reboot with a 
call to di-utils-reboot.postinst. again, this might more express the 
problem i encountered, while a solution might be quite different.
