Hi Peter,

Thanks for your report.
I'm adding debian-kernel@ to the loop, so that they can comment on
this and maybe update udebs to include this extra module.
I'm only discovering this module right now and can't really diagnose
this issue further on my own. But it seems like an extra PCI host
bridge, and not having this module enabled might explain why some
devices which don't depend explicitly on this module (at least based
on modinfo output for all modules) don't show up without it.
Cheers,
