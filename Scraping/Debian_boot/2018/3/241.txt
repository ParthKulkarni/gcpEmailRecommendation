Package: reportbug
Version: 7.1.10
Severity: wishlist
[ Cc'ed -boot@ to ack this suggestion. ]
Hi,
the d-i team wants to be informed of priority changes affecting the
default install.  With Priority: extra gone, these are now all changes
to the Priority.
Please consider adding X-Debbugs-Cc: debian-boot@ by default for bugs
filed against the ftp.debian.org pseudo-package that request an
override change which changes the priority of packages.
Override changes that only affect the section should not be Cc'ed to
debian-boot@.
Ansgar
