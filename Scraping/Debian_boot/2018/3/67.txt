For debian-boot@: newt now has a new udeb, it migrated to testing, Aur√©lien
removed the build-dep on libnewt, and we should be getting a cdebconf binNMU
soon to get cdebconf-newt-udeb to depend on that new udeb instead of the
current libnewt0.52; since the last two bits seem to be happening in the
wrong order, that explains why d-i daily builds are popping up as broken on
various archs (where libnewt0.52 is no longer getting pulled automatically).
