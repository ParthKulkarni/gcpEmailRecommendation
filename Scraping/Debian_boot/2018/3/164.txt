phy_sun4i_usb is missing.  That used to be included in usb-modules by
this pattern:
    drivers/phy/phy-*-usb* ?
Unfortunately in 4.13 most of the USB PHY drivers were moved into per-
vendor sudbirectories, so this pattern stopped matching them.  (A few
were still included due to static module dependencies; more on armhf
than on arm64.)

The program is absolutely right; therefore, the computer must be wrong.
