I copied debian-boot since this issue may be more appropriate there

It's possible I missed something but I don't see any errors until it fails with:
Feb 18 23:25:17 in-target: Reading package lists...
Feb 18 23:25:18 localechooser: error: the command 'validlocale' is not available
Feb 18 23:25:30 base-installer: info: Found kernels ''
Feb 18 23:26:17 base-installer: error: exiting on error base-installer/kernel/no-kernels-found
Feb 18 23:26:19 main-menu[1382]: (process:7509): Aborted
Maybe some debian-boots folks can look over the log with their
trained eyes.
I don't know what the validlocale error is about.
And I don't see why no kernel is found.
debian-boot, any idea?
