Package: busybox
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
Many of our customers would like to use the debian installer in order to set up their own VMs. Our DHCP servers currently offer addresses with /32 subnets, and we've come to realize that the debian installer does not properly configure the default route.
A fix for /32 has already been implemented in an earlier version of busybox, but it doesn't seem to work as expected, because the interface isn't defined while adding the relevant route.
Here's a suggested fix, which would probably also clear up what I mean:

We would appreciate it if you could patch all current/relevant versions to use this fix.
Thank you!
