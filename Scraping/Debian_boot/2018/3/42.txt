Mode 0600 wasn't intially given as a reason:

   The main reason for this is that as far as I know writing configs
   related to a wireless network to /e/n/i enforce using only that
   particular network later (of course if you don't modify the file) and
   also that the interface is unmanageable for other tools. The idea was
   to leave the network unconfigured, so that it can be managed later
   (perhaps via something else than NM).
Later in the thread:

   IIRC we decided on this default before we added the code to change the
   access mode of /e/n/i if it contains a password. The main reason for
   defaulting to no configuration in this case was to avoid having
   passwords in there. If people think it should default to ifupdown in
   this case this can be changed.
The default (loopback only for wireless) was added without considering
mode 0600. At this stage in the history there appears to be a willingness
to use ifupdown and not loopback.

Or dispense with loopback for an installation over wireless (an easy
enough change) and warn about 0600 in the Release Notes.
