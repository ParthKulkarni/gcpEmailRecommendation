I built a new version of u-boot with EFI emulation support enabled, and
successfully booted the mini.iso, but still have the problems with
missing modules in the installer. These modules were insufficient to get
the USB network adapter to work:

That could be compared against the list from the initial report to see
if anything obvious is missing.
Interestingly enough, the microSD is detected; there must be differences
in the device-tree that u-boot loads when doing EFI emulation and the
one provided with the kernel package.
