Thanks; somehow I missed that, sorry.

The fact that doing something in one particular way takes longer does
not in and of itself make it a bad solution.
It also need not take that long. We can declare *right now* that
shipping something in /bin (as opposed to /usr/bin) that is not a
compatibility symlink will be RC in bullseye. This would be plenty of
time for maintainers to be aware of it and to start looking at updating
their packages. With your usrmerge package, it's not at all clear to me
when the migration would be finished.

This is incorrect. The current plan has some systems be merged-/usr and
others not while we are in the transition. It therefore introduces
Debian-wide complexity in that maintainers are expected to support both
merged and unmerged /usr, which causes problems (as we see here). It
also effects a change without the maintainers of the software in
question being involved, which could have unintended side effects with
some packages that we don't know yet (and that we probably won't know
about until the release of buster).
Changing this through a policy change, as we've always done, would not
have those problems:
- Maintainers are expected to move their own package to merged-/usr, so
  they would be aware of issues that might ensue and would be able to
  deal with them.
- We are not expected to be supporting merged-/usr and unmerged-/usr at
  the same time; instead, we'll be gradually moving towards a
  merged-/usr situation.
- We don't end up with packages' files being moved from under them.

Yes, obviously, that's the whole point.

I don't agree with both these statements.

Yes, and at the same time it would reduce a huge amount of *different*
work, since packages now won't need to be changed so that "being built
on merged-/usr" won't result in packages that don't build on
unmerged-/usr.
