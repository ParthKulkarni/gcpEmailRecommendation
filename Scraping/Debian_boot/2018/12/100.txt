This bug also prevents installation of Debian in OpenBSD's native
vmm(4) hypervisor: https://man.openbsd.org/vmm
The vmm hypervisor only provides virtio devices. Installation of Debian
with a netinstall image fails in the same way as described above.
OpenBSD users who want to use Debian in vmm currently have to install
Debian in Qemu and then boot the installed system in vmm. This works
around the problem but it is very inconvenient.
