Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.96
Severity: normal
Tags: patch
Dear Maintainer,
please support Hardkernel's Odroid HC1/HC2 boards. Odroid HC1 board is based on
Odroid XU4 board, but it has no HDMI, no eMMC, no built-in USB3.0 hub, no
extension port pins, and no GPIO button. USB3.0 ports are used for built-in
JMicron USB to SATA bridge and Gigabit R8152 ethernet chips. HC1 uses only
passive cooling.
The kernel ships a different device tree blob for it. I have successfully
tested following flash-kernel configuration:
Machine: Hardkernel Odroid HC1
Kernel-Flavors: armmp armmp-lpae
DTB-Id: exynos5422-odroidhc1.dtb
Boot-Script-Path: /boot/boot.scr
U-Boot-Script-Name: bootscr.uboot-generic
Required-Packages: u-boot-tools
The Odroid HC2 uses the same hardware, but a bigger case to allow mounting a
3.5" drive instead of a 2.5" drive. The Linux kernel does not provide a HC2 DTB
so the HC1 DTB is also used for the Odroid HC2. So this flash-kernel
configuration should also support the Odroid HC2.
