Package: netcfg
Severity: wishlist
Tags: patch
Patch at https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/netcfg/merge_requests/4
This mirrors the corresponding static hostname that is defined for
IPv6:
> # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
> ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
These lines exist because there are some situations where you can only
conveniently specify a hostname but you wish to force a particular protocol.
For the same reason "ip4-localhost" is useful.
I was inspired to request this and write the patch because I hit this exact
situation with some software I am debugging.
