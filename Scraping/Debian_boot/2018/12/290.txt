Dear maintainer,
Is there any chance of getting this patch merged before the buster 
transition freeze on 2019-01-12?  It would be a shame to miss the 
release and have to wait an additional 2 years for this to be included 
in Debian stable (bullseye).  Is there anything I can do to help with 
this?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,
David
