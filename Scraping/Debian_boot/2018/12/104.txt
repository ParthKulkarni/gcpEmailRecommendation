Remember that usrmerge is going to move stuff from /sbin to /usr/sbin
etc not vice versa, so without /usr mounted from the initramfs you
won't find /sbin/lvm at all i.e. the issue is more pronounced with
usrmerge, not less.
BTW the initramfs's generated by the tools in Debian have been
usrmerged for a long time, and it should be those copies of LVM and its
dependencies which are being used anyway.
