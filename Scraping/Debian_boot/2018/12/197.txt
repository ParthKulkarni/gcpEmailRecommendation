- deletion of file config.guess (1530 lines)
- deletion of file config.h.in (92 lines)
- deletion of file config.sub (1782 lines)
- deletion of file configure (13820 lines)
- deletion of file depcomp (700 lines)
- deletion of file doc/Makefile.in (400 lines)
- deletion of file include/debian-installer/Makefile.in (680 lines)
- deletion of file include/debian-installer/system/Makefile.in (500 lines)
- deletion of file include/Makefile.in (640 lines)
- deletion of file install.sh (520 lines)
- deletion of file ltmail.sh (9660 lines)
- deletion of file Makefile.in (830 lines)
- deletion of file missing (330 lines)
- deletion of file src/Makefile.in (780 lines)

This looks rather invasive to me ...
I would prefer to not upload this one myself.
