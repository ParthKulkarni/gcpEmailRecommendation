Dear colleagues,
Could some admin of the Salsa repo's add my user (jfs) to both the d-i and
the installation-guide projects in Salsa?
I used to have access previously in Alioth but my user was not moved to the
new project. I did not needed the access before, but would need it in the
coming months to update the translation into Spanish.
Thanks!
Javier
