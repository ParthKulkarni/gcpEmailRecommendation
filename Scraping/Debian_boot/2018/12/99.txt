Package: d-i.debian.org
Severity: important
The dvd is dated 12/3/2018. Its the dvd that mounts with the volume
label: /debian-testing-amd64-i386-netinst.iso
Installing for the i386 target on a Mac Pro 1,1 produces the error message:
"No installable kernel was found in the defined APT sources."
What I have done to get around this bug is to install a previous release, then perform dist-upgrade
