At first I thought this would be easily solved by moving from tracking
Debian 9 to tracking Debian 10, but here's what we get after the update:
    + gpgv --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg /home/kibi/debian-installer/packages/debian-installer-netboot-images/Release.gpg /home/kibi/debian-installer/packages/debian-installer-netboot-images/Release

    gpgv:                using RSA key A1BD8E9D78F7FE5C3E65D8AF8B48AD6246925553
    gpgv: Can't check signature: No public key
    gpgv: Signature made Sat 10 Nov 2018 10:12:51 UTC

    gpgv: Good signature from "Debian Archive Automatic Signing Key (8/jessie) <ftpmaster@debian.org>"
    gpgv: Signature made Sat 10 Nov 2018 10:18:21 UTC
    gpgv:                using RSA key 067E3C456BAE240ACEE88F6FEF0F382A1A7B6500
    gpgv: Good signature from "Debian Stable Release Key (9/stretch) <debian-release@lists.debian.org>"
    make[1]: *** [debian/rules:19: get-images-amd64] Error 2
So gpgv exits with 2 because one of the signature couldn't be checked
due to a missing public key?
A1BD8E9D78F7FE5C3E65D8AF8B48AD6246925553 is:
    Debian Archive Automatic Signing Key (7.0/wheezy) <ftpmaster@debian.or
    4096 bit RSA key 0x8B48AD6246925553, created: 2012-04-27, expires: 2020-04-25
which was removed from d-a-k in 2018.1:
  https://tracker.debian.org/news/998794/accepted-debian-archive-keyring-20181-source-into-unstable/
Back to reading the actual failure in the log you pasted, it's actually
a BAD signature, which is a bit worrying. I'll have to get back to that
later on.
In the meanwhile, I've pushed this:
  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer-netboot-images/commit/c59c0c2335052dce98810ce99775621292e630ec
  https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer-netboot-images/commit/650baa18dba7f28db72c2f46b5dc82b0526c02e4
On a side note, there are a few things that needs getting done in d-a-k:
  https://bugs.debian.org/917535
  https://bugs.debian.org/917536
So possibly we're currently lacking a newer key, so ftp-master still
uses an old (Debian 7) key instead of a newer one, which explains the
failure to verify the buster builds?
Cc-ing packages@r.d.o for input.
Cheers,
