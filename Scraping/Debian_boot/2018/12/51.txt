Package: debian-installer
Severity: serious
I tried "debian-9.6.0-mipsel-xfce-CD-1.iso" and "debian-9.6.0-mipsel-DVD-1.iso" on QEMU and found that both images are actually "netinst" variant. After I chose my country and defined the hostname, the installer forced me to choose a mirror. After that it started downloading components of the installer from the mirror and ignores the many preloaded packages inside the CD/DVD.
This should be consider "unusable" because the nature of the artifacts has changed.
