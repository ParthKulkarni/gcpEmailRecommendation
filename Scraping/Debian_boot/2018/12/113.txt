Certainly. And it should be easy to setup since you can use
debian-boot@l.d.o as maintainer email to automatically add all the
relevant packages.

FWIW you don't send commit notices to a team. You send them to
dispatch@tracker.d.o and the package tracker forwards the
mails to all subscribers for the given package (either direct subscribers
or people subscribed through the team).
FTR, devscripts now has a "salsa" tool that lets you easily configure the
required integrations to send the commit notices and IRC bot, etc.
Cheers,
