 Hmm, I'm still considering what's the good way...

 Yes, that's right. #839046 was filed in Sep 2016, and uploaded in Jun 2018.

 Well, with a quick look to the thread (I cannot follow all of the email in it,
 tons of emails...), I cannot find the discussion about
  - What is the problem? (broken build for which packages? Just R?)
  - How many packages are affected?
  - Why it was caused? (just symlink to /bin or /sbin isn't enough
    to deal with it?)
  - Does it cause any failure on users' machine?
 So, I want to listen above things (not thought or idea), then reply to
 your question. Please quote if someone can do it.
