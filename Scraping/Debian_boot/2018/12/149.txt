https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488552 is what I was
hitting last time around.  That got resolved as fixed a few days ago,
although it depends on a refactoring that's not in 60.  Still, might be
worth trying to run SpiderMonkey tests on trunk on 64bit BE and see if
and how much better it is now.
