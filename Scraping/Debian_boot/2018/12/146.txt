This seems like something that we should support at some point, AFAICT
grub's cryptodisk support has been around for quite a while, but I've
never managed to dive into it.
A step by step guide would certainly be helpful to others, and might be
a basis for d-i contributors to get involved in implementing this.
Thanks for your proposal.
