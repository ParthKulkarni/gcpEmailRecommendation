Hi all,
since we are slowly coming nearer to the end of the development cycle for 
Buster, it's probably a good time to send a heads-up to you translators for
the installation-guide now.
There are still several months left, but you might want to start working on
translation updates now, to save yourself from last-minute hurry! :-)
(Several languages are updated regularly, and don't need this heads-up 
mail strictly spoken :-) This is really great. 
I added those to the recipients nevertheless, just for completeness.)
Please find the Debian GIT repository at
https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/installation-guide
In case of questions or trouble, don't hesitate to ask for help on
debian-boot@lists.debian.org or me.
Thanks for your time
Holger
