Package: pkgsel
Version: 0.60
Severity: serious
While testing a fix for #908711, I found that pkgsel diverts
update-initramfs during the upgrade and installation process
and runs it once at the end.
By default, "update-initramfs -u" updates the new initramfs for the
newest kernel version that update-initramfs was previously run for.
If a new kernel package was installed due to an ABI bump, no new
initramfs will be generated.  This causes the system to fail to
boot.
Ben.
