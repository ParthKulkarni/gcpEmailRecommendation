What we probably need is expanding fb-modules udeb for arm64 with
several entries:
- radeonfb
- nouveau
- virtio-gpu (for VM guest instances)
This should cover real hardware machines with either AMD Radeon or
NVidia graphic cards and also virtual machines.
UEFI does not even need to have X86EmulatorPkg to get it working. For
Radeon cards (not checked with NVidia) kernel can initialize them
perfectly fine without Option ROM support.
And for VMs it just works with recent EDK2 used.
