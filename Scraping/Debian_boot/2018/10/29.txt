Hi translators,
since we are slowly coming nearer to the end of the development cycle for 
Buster, it's probably a good time to send a heads-up to you for the 
debian-installer now.
There is still a lot of time left, but you might want to start working on
translation updates now, to save yourself from a last-minute hurry! :-)
For those of you who are working directly on the Debian GIT repository, this
is at https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/d-i.
Or, if you work via the Weblate web interface, use
https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-installer/.
For some statistics, visit https://d-i.debian.org/l10n-stats/.
In case of questions or trouble, don't hesitate to ask for help on
debian-boot or me.
Many thanks
Holger
