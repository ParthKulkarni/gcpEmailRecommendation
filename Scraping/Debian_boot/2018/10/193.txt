I just tried to install Debian to a Banana Pi from the
daily/netboot/SD-card-image installer (2018-10-28). The USB
keyboard still doesn't work.
After enabling the HDMI console output following instructions
here
https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Allwinner#Installing_from_an_SD_card_image
the installer boots and prints the language selection menu, but
as the keyboard is not working, installation cannot be continued
(without a serial connection).
I get these messages to the console during kernel startup:
usb0-vbus: disabling
usb1-vbus: disabling
usb2-vbus: disabling
These suggest that although the necessary modules probably are
included in the kernel and initrd, the USB buses are not powered
on.
