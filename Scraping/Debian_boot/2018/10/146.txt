Dear all,
Please CC me as I'm not subscribed to the list.
I was looking at Debian buster wiki page.
https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBuster
I did see the notes from the release team sometime back
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/09/msg00004.html
Does it mean we won't have an alpha 4 of Debian buster before freeze
or would there ?
There is an event happening in India debutsav kochi
https://debutsav.in
Where I was hoping to have a debian buster  alpha 4 release if it's on
the radar.
If not, we could always use the daily release but that is pretty much
a hit and release thing.

I do know that we now have a sort of testing summary page which tells
about somethings
https://d-i.debian.org/testing-summary.html
The other thing I could is share the internalization stats so people
can see where we are.
https://d-i.debian.org/l10n-stats/
Looking forward to guidance.
