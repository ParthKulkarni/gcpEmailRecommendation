We don't build radeonfb for arm64, since it only supports old Radeon
chips (up to about 2004).
For current AMD chips the only native driver is amdgpu; for older chips
it's radeon.  Both of them will need some firmware just to light up the
display.

This also needs firmware to drive recent chips.  It's possible the
driver can set up the display controller without it though.

I really don't think it makes sense to try to support this case.  It
seems to be that the proportion of ARM64 systems booting with UEFI
*and* using a plug-in graphics card *and* using that card for display
(rather than off-screen rendering or GPGPU) is likely to be vanishingly
small.
