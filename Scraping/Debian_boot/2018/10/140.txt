Package: debian-installer
Hello maintainer,
i'm currently trying to install debian on a new Olimex A20 Lime 2 Rev. K.
This board uses a new ethernet-PHY, which seems to be unsupported by
current debian images. (I tried stable, as well as the installer daily
build from 2018-10-21).
The hardware-changelog says:
A20-OLinuXino-Lime2_Rev_H
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. Ethernet PHY changed to commercial variant - KSZ9031RNXCC-TR;
I found bugreport #864562, where it is stated that one could change the
state of GPIO-Pin 17.
That however does not do anything on my board. Ethernet still does not
work.
I'll send syslog / dmesg-output when i get screen to finally save a log.
Thank you and best regards,
Dieter
