Hello,
i have not had a lot of time to look into this today.
However, i found this line in the syslog:
Jan  1 00:00:27 kernel: [    7.327358] Micrel KSZ9031 Gigabit PHY
stmmac-0:01: attached PHY driver [Micrel KSZ9031 Gigabit PHY]
(mii_bus:phy_addr=stmmac-0:01, irq=POLL)
And the kernel seems to detect the ethernet also:
Jan  1 00:00:27 kernel: [    7.002010] sun7i-dwmac 1c50000.ethernet: PTP
uses main clock

Jan  1 00:00:27 kernel: [    7.184237] sun7i-dwmac 1c50000.ethernet:

And of course, network auto-configuration fails.
It does not work in u-boot either.
Thanks and best regards,
Dieter
