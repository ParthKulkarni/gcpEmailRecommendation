This is not an error; ppc64el systems do not need yaboot.

Debian 7 "wheezy" did not include the ppc64el architecture.  Since you
successfully installed wheezy, you presumably used the powerpc
architecture.  ppc64el is only meant for systems with IBM POWER 8/9
processors running in little-endian mode.
The powerpc architecture was not included in Debian 9 and is not
covered by Debian 8 LTS, but you can install Debian 8 and then upgrade
to the unstable distribution hosted on ports.debian.org:
