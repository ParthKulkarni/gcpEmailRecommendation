Hi Bastian - do you mean you intend to request removal of grub-legacy
from debian?
I don't know how many others are in my situation, but my VPS provider
has some kind of centralised grub-legacy that requires me to keep its
config files updated, and grub-legacy is currently the easiest way to do
that.
Cheers,
Richard
