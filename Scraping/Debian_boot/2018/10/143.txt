Dear ladies and gentlemen,
I downloaded a debian squeeze live xfce4 dvd and booted the
iso-file with unetbootin. There is one (small) thing, I wanted to
tell you:
when you restart, the system does not reboot in the boot-sequence
like other operation systems (os), but it only restarts itself. In other os
when you boot from a burnt cd/dvd, at reboot the cd rom drive opens,
you can take out the cd/dvd and reboot continues. In squeeze the
cd rom drive opens only for 2 seconds and is closed again.
I know, that this is an old version. Possibly this is no longer of any 
interest.
But I wanted to inform you.
Yours sincerely
C.Mielech
