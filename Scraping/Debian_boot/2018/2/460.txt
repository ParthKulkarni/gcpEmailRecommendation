Package: udhcpd 
Version: 1:1.27.2-2
I noticed that the copy of /etc/udhcpd.conf installed by the udhcpd
package includes a section describing the "remaining" option:
=====
# If remaining is true (default), udhcpd will store the time
# remaining for each lease in the udhcpd leases file. This is
# for embedded systems that cannot keep time between reboots.
# If you set remaining to no, the absolute time that the lease
# expires at will be stored in the dhcpd.leases file.
#remaining      yes             #default: yes
=====
However, this option was actually removed from the udhcpd program many
years ago, in commit 0416e3dde17ea9295635c52183b30fe3d7172333  (See,
e.g.:
  https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit?id=0416e3dde17ea9295635c52183b30fe3d7172333
or
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/busybox.git/commit/?id=0416e3dde17ea9295635c52183b30fe3d7172333
), and from the examples/udhcp/udhcpd.conf file in the upstream source
in commit 2b0e95780863da44f6a9244699ece8620a599e19 .
(Comparing those two files quickly I don't see any other obsolete option
still listed in the Debian /etc/udhcpd.conf file.)
