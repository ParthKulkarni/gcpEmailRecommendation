Dear Tobias,
There is no a .po file yet to send.
Could you please, send me the needed file(s) with country names to translate into Tajik.
Thank you so much,
Victor

Sure, I'll be happy to do this! Victor, do you have a .po file which you could send to me? Then I'll integrate this into iso-codes so that the country names are available in Tajik as well.
If you do not have a .po file yet or if you need further help from me, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Regards,
Tobias
