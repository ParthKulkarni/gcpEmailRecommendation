Hi there,
I was able to get Grub working as the default boot-loader. Turns out
Win10 by default always tries to boot up.
* First I Switched off the Fast restart option from the settings menu.
* Then from the BIOS changed the boot order to Debian BOOT LOADER.
Thanks for getting back to me.
Debian freezes though, something I did not expect Debian to do. I
might soon make a separate bug report for it.
I boot up: sometimes it freezes right off the login screen, keyboard
mouse or key combinations(ctrl+alt+f1, ctrl+alt+*) don't work.
At other times the wicd(I use xfce desktop) cannot connect to my wifi,
then the system hangs and freezes. On both the occasions restarting
works. Most of the times I'm clueless and have to manually shut down
the laptop. Is their any event viewer or log where I can see what
happens during these events?
Thank you
Regards
