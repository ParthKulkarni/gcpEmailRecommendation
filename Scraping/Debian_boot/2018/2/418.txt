I think this is not a good idea. The location of the scripts file is part
of the public interface since debootstrap takes a script file
as 4th parameter.
Or maybe it's a good idea because we are going to have collisions one day
between codenames of the various distributions but then you have to keep
the current files for a little longer and you probably should consider
further changes so that we can pass "debian/sid" or "kali/kali-rolling"
as 1st parameter (suite).
But this is also not required to implement this:

This part looks fine from a cursory review.
