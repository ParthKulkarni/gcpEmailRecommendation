Hi Martin,
I sincerely apologize for setting the wrong severity to the wrong
package in the original report.
(I thought the system could be in a state where it would not reboot at all)
I am sorry to inform you that changing to MODULES=dep in
initramfs.conf did not help.
(driver-policy already had MODULES=dep).
And no, I am not using LVM or RAID (just a standard ext2-partitions
for /, /boot, /home/ and one for swap on a single SATA drive).
The good thing is that the system reboots properly and seems to work
fine with the old 3.16 kernel.
There is no
/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/compress
I will try it out and get back.
Thank you very much!
