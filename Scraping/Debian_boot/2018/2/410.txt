The entry which Debian is adding to the UEFI boot menu is really a
pointer to the Grub (so a more technically correct title for the entry
would be "Debian's Grub bootloader"[0], but that would be terrible from
a UI perspective).
If Debian didn't install Grub into the UEFI boot menu then nothing else
in the system would know how to read and interpret the Grub menu. So
installing Grub is needed for:

The system probably has a Windows bootloader preinstalled (probably
labelled "Hard Drive" in the UEFI menu) but that is not as flexible as
Grub and Debian does/will not mess around with its configuration files.
Ian.
[0] In the same way I suggested earlier that "Hard Drive" was just what
MS (or the system builder or whoever) has decided to call the entry
which points to the Windows bootloader. That's a reasonable choice for
an ecosystem where some large majority of users do not install an
alternative (either replacement or dual boot) OS. In Debian's case a
more specificly named entry makes sense.
