Hi,
I'd like to make a stable upload for systemd fixing a couple of issues.
An annotated changelog follows.
Full debdiff is attached.
systemd (232-25+deb9u2) stretch; urgency=medium
  * networkd: Handle MTU field in IPv6 RA (Closes: #878162)
https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd/commit/9f134218fa5ed60a4d7b0a2282d86ab56f52a3e9
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=878162
It's a cherry-pick of an upstream commit which is already in
unstable/testing.
This change was requested by Julien Cristau who already confirmed that it
fixes the issue for stretch.
  * shared: Add a linker script so that all functions are tagged @SD_SHARED
    instead of @Base.
    This helps prevent symbol collisions with other programs and libraries.
    In particular, because PAM modules are loaded into the process that is
    creating the session, and systemd creates PAM sessions, the potential
    for collisions is high. (Closes: #873708)
https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd/commit/bd33312f7fcf660f568bf2bac288b5ceec6981ab
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=873708
It's a backport of an upstream commit which is already in
unstable/testing.
I'd consider this the most important fix, as we have seen segfaults in
systemd when e.g. libpam-heimdal was used.
  * resolved: Fix loop on packets with pseudo dns types.
    CVE-2017-15908 (Closes: #880026)
https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd/commit/5a469751160af8334ca4748ee00ee9b7e1a3efe3
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=880026
It's a cherry-pick of an upstream commit which is already in
unstable/testing.
The security team suggested to fix this via a stable upload, as the
issue was not considered severe enough for a security upload (resolved
is not enabled by default in Debian)
  * machinectl: Don't output "No machines." with --no-legend option
    (Closes: #880158)
https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd/commit/9c22320c9d012bb515fb91752795fa4a6649dc5f
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=880158
It's a cherry-pick of an upstream commit which is already in
unstable/testing.
The fix is trivial and has very low regression potential, so I decided
to include this patch as well. I'm fine with dropping it though, if you
have concerns.
The changes don't affect the installer. That said I've CCed debian-boot
for their ack.
Please let me know if I can proceed with the upload.
Regards,
Michael
