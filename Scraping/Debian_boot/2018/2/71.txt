(I'm not affected by this so just a drive-by comment).
For most applets this seems like sound logic, but for the `chroot`
applet specifically the likely purpose would seem to be to switch into
a new, non-broken, root and execute commands there. Switching into the
chroot and then reexecuting the busybox from the host instead of the
command from within that chroot seems rather counter-intuitive to me.
The patch given only seem to affect the command executed post-chroot
and not any other internal execing (including not the execution of
`chroot` itself).
Ian.
