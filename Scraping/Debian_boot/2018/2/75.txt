Hi Joe,
That commit (d035528261eb9304e9e448c7d8847095b8e8c7c5) was included in
the Busybox 1.26.0 upstream release, and therefore included in the
Debian upload for 1:1.27.2-1 back in September.
I realise that busybox doesn't currently build for kfreebsd-*, but
that's a separate issue (and any help is gratefully received).
Regards,
Chris
