Hello everyone,
because this bug report is still not closed, I would like to check the status of this bug report after more than a year and after the release of Debian Stretch.
When is it planned to replace the VLC Media Player with Xfce's own Media Player Parole?
And no, the VLC player is not a good alternative, as mentioned above due to the Qt dependencies and of course because this player often has security vulnerabilities.
It is therefore advisable to replace the VLC Media Player with the Media Player Parole.
Regards
Jürgen
