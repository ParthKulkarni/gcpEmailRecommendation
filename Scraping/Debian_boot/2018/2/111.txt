Hmmm. That's odd, but most likely a firmware issue on your machine. I
see you have an HP Notebook, but a model I don't recognise. It's quite
possible that it has broken Windows-specific support in the firmware,
or some other bug that causes it not to use more than one boot option.
In Debian, we've seen lots of buggy UEFI implementations I'm
afraid. There are workarounds available for some. What *might* help
here is installing grub to the removable media path too. Either boot
the installer into rescue mode to do that, or run
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow grub-efi-amd64
on your system and turn it on that way. Please let us know if it helps!
