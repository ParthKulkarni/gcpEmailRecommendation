Regis Boudin <regis@debian.org> has not been working on
the cdebconf package for quite some time.
We are tracking their status in the MIA team and would like to ask you
to remove them from the Uploaders list of the package so we can close
that part of the file.
(If the person is listed as Maintainer, what we are asking is to please
step in as a new maintainer.)
Thanks.
