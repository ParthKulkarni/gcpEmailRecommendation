Once again, I have strictly no advice about this. Formerly in the bug
report, Yves-Alexis didn't really object but argued about VLC being
kind of the reference player which "everybody" expects. On the ther
hand he gave no advice *against* having Parole specifically in the
Xfce task.
Finally, as we were late in the release process, the change didn't
seem a good thing to do at that moment....but now is maybe a better
moment.
Xfce developers in Debian (if some are left), do you have objections ?
