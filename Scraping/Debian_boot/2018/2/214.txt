Problems:
GRUB boots OK. Choosing any boot menu entry (graphical install, install, etc.) the system freezes completely. I tried run commands manually as following:
linux /install.i386/vmlinuz
initrd /install.i386/initrd.gz
boot
Then got same effect without errors. I also tested vmlinuz and initrd.gz from each image except live in qemu-system-i386. Both 9.3.0 continuously print error message after "fast init done". The testing one boots here without errors
