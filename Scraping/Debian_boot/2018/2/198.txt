It seems to me that there are two bugs:
1. flash-kernel gave a useless hint to use MODULES=dep, when that was
already the current configuration.
2. It didn't give the useful hint to use COMPRESS=xz, or make that
configuration change itself.
Now that I think about it, initramfs-tools does allow other packages to
override the configuration for mkinitramfs through shell scripts in
/usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf-hooks.d.  This seems like a good reason
to do that.
