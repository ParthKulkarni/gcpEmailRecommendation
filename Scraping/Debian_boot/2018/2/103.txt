Also, having the translation complete does *not* mean that you'll
immediately see it when testing D-I. It needs each individual package
to be uploaded with the included translation, whether it is ofr levels
1, 2 or 3. For level 1, that depends on uploads I do on a semi-regular
basis. For levels 2 and 3, it depends on each package maintainer.
Moreover, given the way D-I works, several packages that are used are
used from testing, so it needs those packages to also migrate from
unstable to testing.
