The question more is whether Check-Date=false should only disable
Checks on the "Date" field or not. DonKult said it makes more sense
to have it be a one stop that also sets Check-Valid-Until=false
(and that's implemented in my branch).
So basically you either have to set just Check-Date=false or you
have to set both of them. In either case, you'll have option(s)
to disable date checking :D
