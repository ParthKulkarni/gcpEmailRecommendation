As Lennart said: "adding an entry to the boot meny is what you do when
you install an OS you want to be able to boot". Adding an entry in the
UEFI boot variables *is how UEFI is meant to work*. If you don't add
an entry there, a correctly-working UEFI won't know how to find the OS
you just installed.
There's more information about Debian and UEFI in https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI
