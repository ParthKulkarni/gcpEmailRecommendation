Hi,
Creating this file with COMPRESS=xz worked fine
/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/compress
Obviously, with xz there is plenty of space left. There was a little
warning though (see below).
Generating kernel u-boot image... done.
Flashing kernel (using 2050440/2097152 bytes)... done.
Flashing initramfs (using 2870792/4194304 bytes)... done.
W: APT had planned for dpkg to do more than it reported back (0 vs 7).
   Affected packages: flash-kernel:armel initramfs-tools:armel
Yes, this system has been upgraded several time. I think your web page
even said that that is the correct/only way to do it.
I guess installing Stretch does COMPRESS=xz on its own.
Thank you so much. My problem is now solved. But perhaps xz could be
part of the upgrade process.
