Hi Linus,
I believe this bug is fixed with upstream commit
d7bfee1edb551d3503c7b616702a73192ba069a9, which is included in the
upstream 1.24.0 release. I cannot reproduce your test case in
1:1.27.2-2, currently in testing and unstable, so I believe that the bug
is indeed resolved in Debian.
Best regards,
Chris
