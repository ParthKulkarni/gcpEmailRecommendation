Source: debian-installer
Version: 20171204
Severity: normal
Tags: sid buster

Usertags: c_rehash
This package is using the c_rehash command which is part of the
openssl package. The c_rehash script is considered by upstream as a
fallback script and will disappear at some point. The recommended way
is to use the "openssl rehash" command instead which appeared in
1.1.0. Please make sure that this package does not use the c_rehash
command anymore.
The "openssl rehash" command creates half that many symlinks (one per
certificate instead of two) because it uses only the newer hash.
There is also the -compat option which creates both symlinks (and
behaves like c_rehash currently does). The hash changed from md5 to
sha1 during the 0.9.8 to 1.0.0 transition so I doubt that the
"compat" mode will be required.
Should the c_rehash script be mentioned in the source code or script
of this package but is not used during the build process or in the
final package then feel free to close the bug saying so.
