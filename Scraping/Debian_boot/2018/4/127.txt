"gutsy" and "intrepid" are typo'd here.

I don't think you should include the kernel version check here, because
this is a configuration change made in Debian that may be made in
different versions (or not at all) in kernel packages for Debian
derivatives or custom kernels.

This is slightly strange wording.  And that documentation file might
not be installed.  Can I suggest the following instead:
    You're trying to create an old amd64 release, which may segfault
    on later kernel versions.  You may need to add 'vsyscall=emulate'
    to the kernel parameters to avoid this.
Ben.
