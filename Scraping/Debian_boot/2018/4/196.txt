Your patch will try to umount /proc even if it has not been mounted by
debootstrap. That's wrong. If you detect that /proc was handled outside of
debootstrap, then you should also not umount it.
And the handling of /sys should be entirely separate from /proc. Even if
/proc was already mounted, you want debootstrap to ensure that /sys is
mounted too.
