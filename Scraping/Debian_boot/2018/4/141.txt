Disclaimer:
- I'm a perl team member, but not a DD (nor a DM).
- I'm definitely not the best perl expert available in the team, but
hopefully other members can have a quick look too.
- I use debootstrap a lot, but it's the first time I actually looks at
its code and I might miss some stuff regarding that.
So, now that it's out of the way...
I had a look today. It looks good to me, at first glance I had concerns
(like using hash keys in boolean context without the exists function),
but everytime I checked further, it looked fine in context. That for the
perl part.
Other than that, if I may give my opinion, the commit messages make the
patches pretty self explanatory, and the portability concerns are
adressed (you still need grep -E but busybox can provide it, if your
grep doesn't implement it). The changes make perfect sense and the
performance boost is impresssive.
Barring any concern from someone more knowledgeable, I would definitely
apply this :)
Cheers,
