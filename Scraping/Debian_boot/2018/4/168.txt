That looks like a request to close the bug, so that's what I'm doing.
For future reference, you could have done that yourself by adding the
-done after the bug number, as I do now.
BTW it sounds like you've got another DHCP server somewhere on your
network, that's answering faster than the proxied server -- normally the
DHCPACK gets logged, along with the IP address of the server than sent
it, so that ought to tell you where it's hiding.
Cheers, Phil.
