Comments/Problems:
Switched BIOS settings to allow legacy boot and make USB drives first, attempt was made to start from USB drive, got "Grub Loading Stage 1.5, Error 17" Cannot boot from this drive.
I will try writing the image to a different USB drive to see if the problem might be the partition table of the installer drive, which is what Error 17 would seem to point to.
