With version 2.12~rc3 (currently in unstable), qemu-user-static doesn't
require copying the qemu-ARCH-static binary into the chroot.
You can simply call:
  debootstrap --arch=ARCH sid CHROOT
... and it just works now, without any debootstrap --foreign or
qemu-debootstrap wrappers!
You might still want the binary copied into the chroot to make it easier
if moving the chroot to another machine, but that seems well outside the
scope of what debootstrap should worry about.
