Not by default, no.

You could save the information in a clunky way by using "logger" on
the command line, something like (untested!):
  # logger -t my-script "<commands>"
  # <commands> | logger -t my-script 2>&1
That way you'll have to issue each of your commands twice, first to
log what you're sending and secondly to run it, with output redirected
to logger. "logger" is a tool to put things in syslog.
