Hi,
by the way apt-key belongs to the package apt:
root@bionic-test:/home/kollstedt# apt-file search apt-key                                                          
[...]
apt: /usr/bin/apt-key
[...]
It is installed when the error occurs and is exitting with the error mentioned 
above.
But there is indeed another way to add the public key without using "apt-key 
add".
 
They can simply be copied to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d, with the ending *.gpg if 
it's binary format. With the ending *.asc for ASCII-amored format.
Please find a patch attached that use this way to add instead of the old way 
with apt-key.
The two following Debian Bugs for this lead me tho this:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=851774
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=886473
I also sent this message to the first one I considered to be the main one. 
For the ones reading the debian bug, this was mainly send to 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg/+bug/1754075
Since this also found it's way to Ubunut 18.4 bionic (unreleased LTS).
But there is some (more or less) usefull disscussion but as far as I can see 
no patch, yet. So I prepared one. Thanks to Marga Manterola and Philipp Kern 
for the idea.
One of the most important errors in stuff discussed there is IMHO the lack of 
"-- " which is necessary to prevent grep from interpreding the leading --. I 
also decided not to filter for things that are not relevant. Since comments 
describing the Publickey or it's origin might be placed above the -----BEGIN 
PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- (without hitting gpgv), and we would not be able to 
prevent all possible syntax evil here, without having gpg to import and export 
the public key to and from a temporary keyring.
I'm also trying to assign a useful name to the key added this way. 
This patch should IMHO work, but I have no opportunity to test it without your 
help, since we're in udeb and testing preseed issues. ;-)
Kind regards,
	Lars
