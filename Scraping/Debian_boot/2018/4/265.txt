It sounds like a great approach. The port should be allocated randomly
from available ports instead of the VPN IP form step #2 above. This
random port together with the random root password will be displayed on
newbie's monitor. Both credentials he will pass by phone to the profi.

This should be no problem: there will be two accounts (with known
private/public keys) - newbie and profi. On the newbie account you'll
block absolutely every possible command (with *) via `visudo`. For the
profi you'll block via `visudo` almost everything except for `ssh`
command with very strict possible arguments which enable only utilizing
the reverse tunnel established by newbies.

There is nothing to implement here - if a profi tries to connect to some
other newbie - he will fail, since he doesn't know his local root
password.
I think something like this could be made a part of Debian
infrastructure not just for Installation purpose, but also at any point
of time. One might implement some sort of "SOS! Need help!" button in
Gnome, or elsewhere which will allow profis to help newbies in the same
way.
This design is also easily scalable/made failure proof by providing
several SSH servers for reverse tunnels within one DNS A entry. Newbie
will establish connections to _all_ known SSH servers, while profi will
pick up any random one.
While digging into this I found that `autossh` might be useful here for
keeping the tunnel alive for long periods of time.
So what do you think about this idea? Should I file a feature request
for this? If yes - where?
Thank you!
