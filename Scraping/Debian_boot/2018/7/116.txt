Hello
I'm trying to install a Stretch system from network in an automatted
way with preseed.
As some things aren't working, I'd like to send the output of
everything via syslog to some server of mine.
How can I do that? I now that I need to add DEBCONF_DEBUG=5 to the
grub command line, but that won't send the messages off the server.
Thanks a lot,
Alexander
