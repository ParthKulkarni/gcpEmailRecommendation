Right, I had seen the successful builds earlier but dinstall was missing
still; I've verified the build goes fine, included the patches for
#902226, opened #903618 to keep track we could be even better there, and
proceeded to a source upload.
Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
Cheers,
