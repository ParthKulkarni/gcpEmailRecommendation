Subject : [PATCH] scripts/gusty: move /proc symlink logic to stage_one
From : Alex Bennée <alex.bennee@linaro.org>
Date : Fri, 13 Jul 2018 11:20:07 +0100
Message-id : 20180713102007.24942-1-alex.bennee@linaro.org


This affects all post gutsy Ubuntu releases and now more closely
mirrors the behaviour in debian-common. The recent changes to
container detection broke QEMU's debootstrap for Ubuntu guests as
setup_proc_symlink would attempt to delete the real containerised
/proc in a stage 2 context causing the bootstrap to fail.
I've added in_target /bin/true to more closely align, it's simply a
check to ensure stage two can execute commands. There is probably
scope for more re-factoring as the remaining differences are mostly
dealing with code names, mirror locations and some minor and possibly
out of date init differences.
