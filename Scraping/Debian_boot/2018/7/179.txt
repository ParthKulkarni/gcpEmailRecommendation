Thanks for the check (and the cc), much appreciated!
Yes, my automated tests will need to receive an extra alternative for
the boot screen, but that's really no big deal.
Regarding accessibility, the one thing that must work is:
  s <enter>
(This starts speech synthesis.)
I think other shortcuts were added over the last few years, but tweaking
menu margin, width, or label shouldn't affect them in any way?
Looping in debian-accessibility@ for extra feedback.
Cheers,
