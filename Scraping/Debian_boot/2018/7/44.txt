You mention netinst a few times, but you seem to be talking about
netboot really. netinst is an ISO image with a bunch of packages, enough
to configure everything needed to pull the rest of the system from a
network mirror; netboot is kernel+initrd for PXE boots and similar
minimalistic approaches.

So it seems we're talking about kernel/drivers/char/virtio_console.ko
that could be added to either the serial-modules udeb or the
virtio-modules one. Kernel maintainers, what do you think?
This might be worth backporting to stretch too. I can send patches when
you've selected the udeb we should be adding this module to.
Cheers,
