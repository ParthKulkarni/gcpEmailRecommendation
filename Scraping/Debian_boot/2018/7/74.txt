No argument here, I'm totally with you.

Thanks for your valuable input. Based on the fact you've made several
attempts already, I decided patches were good enough to include them in
the dini upload for this point release, instead of spending more time
to get a perfect solution (esp. with the next point release coming up in
a few days).
I've opened #903618 to keep track of the improvement over this set of
patches.
Cheers,
