In the end I've been out longer than I thought I would, so I only managed
to give it a go during the night. Being bugged by the perspective of only
build-testing d-i before the upload, I've gone ahead with the whole ‚Äúhack
an archive‚Äù game, and it looks like test cases like plain disk, encrypted
LVM, plain disk with XFS don't regress. Those usually let us (dis)cover
kernel-related fun, so I guess green lights means we can merge this kernel
ABI bump without too many second thoughts.
If that upload gets accepted and built during the day, I can probably take
care of dini this evening.
Cheers,
