I'm finding the need to apologize for neglecting to communicate to the
debian-installer development community over some BoF sessions at the
last two DebConfs regarding alternatives to and possible replacements
for debian-installer.
In retrospect, it was a terribly obvious oversight in communication, and
doubly so that it happened two years in a row. I can even see that the
language used in the talk descriptions could be interpreted poorly. All
I can really do at this point is apologize and promise to do better in
the future, for whatever that is worth.
I hate the thought that I've contributed to anyone's demotivation. Truly
sorry.
I admire and benefit from the work of the debian-installer
developers. I've used it regularly for many years, recommend it to
others. Despite seeing some issues with it and dreaming of alternatives,
I'll continue to contribute to d-i where and when I can, and intend to
continue to do so for the forseeable future.
live well,
  vagrant
