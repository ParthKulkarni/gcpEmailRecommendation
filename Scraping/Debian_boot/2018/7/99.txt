While it does no much harm at first if you select C during installation, 
it immediately screws up C.UTF-8 selected during installation. In that 
case the installer still adds the lines above without any warning, 
therefore if root logs in, he gets C insead of C.UTF-8. Good luck for 
finding these lines in /root/.profile.
The workaround is to remove the lines or to select en_US.utf8 during the 
installation and change locale to C.UTF-8 later. en_US.utf8 does not 
result in the lines being added.
