Hi,
libreoffice-kde got removed from the kde-desktop task once because it
was not built anymore because it was for Qt4/KDE4.
Now with LibreOffice 6.1 it's available again (as libreoffice-kde5, -kde
was readded as a transitional package). So please (re)add
libreoffice-kde5 to the task.
In alioth I had commit rights but in salsa I don't have (yet) so this
bug and:
Patch/MR at http://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/tasksel/merge_requests/2
Regards,
Rene
