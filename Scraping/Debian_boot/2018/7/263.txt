It feels like fstrim should have a mode that looks at volumes 
referenced
by /etc/fstab (just like mount -a, that it wanted to mimic according 
to
I filed https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/issues/673 upstream 
about this.
And the amazing util-linux upstream author Karel already fixed it in 
https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/c5b8909f13d29d066ee9882fe0e3129d2f3bcffc
and now provides an -A option that just looks at fstab. I guess I'll go 
and file a separate bug once that's in a release to make that enabled by 
default.
Kind regards
