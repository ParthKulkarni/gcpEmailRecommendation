Package: partman-crypto
Severity: normal

Dear Maintainer,
partman-crypto does not include the discard option and hence TRIM is disabled for partitions within a LUKS container.
This has been fixed in Ubuntu's partman-crypto since March 2014:
https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/partman-crypto/ubuntu/revision/736
Could the Ubuntu patch please also be included in Debian?
Adding this patch also partially solves bug #869897.
Thanks,
Michael Schaller
