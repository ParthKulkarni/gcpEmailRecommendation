Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.106
Severity: normal
Tags: patch
Since commit https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap/commit/48d77abf3a4209f7cff72aec20f618e086169aa7
debootstrap no longer saves repo list files in an apt compatible
format. A side effect of the old debootstrap.invalid setup was that
the mv_invalid_to function renamed the downloaded repo lists to files
that apt uses. Before you'd get the following:
var/lib/apt/lists/deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_InRelease
Now you get
var/lib/apt/lists/http:__deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_InRelease
That means that you're required to run apt update after debootstrap
finishes since apt will ignore the downloaded lists.

Subject: [PATCH] Strip URL scheme from apt lists
Apt saves the repo lists without the URL scheme, so when debootstrap
keeps the URL scheme in the name they're not usable by apt. That means
you need to run apt update in the completed target even though the lists
have already been fetched. Without this change the default InRelease was
saved as http:__deb.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_InRelease.
This is a regression from commit 48d77ab since the old
debootstrap.invalid setup would rename the lists to the proper name in
most cases since it stripped the leading http://.
