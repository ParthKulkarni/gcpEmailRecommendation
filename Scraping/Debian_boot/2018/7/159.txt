On webpage

There are a bunch of links that are claimed to be for draft release notes for Buster.
Unfortunately, all of them wind up at “Page not found”.
Is this deliberate?  Or is it possibly a result of some recent change of servers, or the like?
I would submit a bug report if I knew what package name to use for it.
Thanks!
Rick
