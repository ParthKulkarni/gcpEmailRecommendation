Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.95ubuntu0.1
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
QEMU's build system has support for debootstrap using binfmt_misc and
QEMU's linux-user emulation. Since commit 9a6ebf628 this is broken as
it checks for the presence of wget which isn't available in the
second-stage environment.
If the user is doing a --second-stage it shouldn't matter that wget is
missing as all the packages have already been downloaded on the host
system.
For reference the wrapper script is:
  https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=tests/docker/dockerfiles/debian-bootstrap.pre;h=56e1aa7a21418437b5b0fbaf473a8686338d9014;hb=cee35138b59c6d6b0808c5fa644e3f063832860f
And you should be able to debootstrap on QEMU's master with a line
like:
  make docker-binfmt-image-debian-ubuntu-xenial-arm64 DEB_ARCH=arm64 \
    DEB_TYPE=xenial DEB_URL=http://ports.ubuntu.com EXECUTABLE=./aarch64-linux-user/qemu-aarch64~
There is also a bug in QEMU's own script which means it always falls
back to the SCM version of debootstrap, but that is mine to fix ;-)
