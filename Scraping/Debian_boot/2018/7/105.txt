I'm not sure this is correct; choose-mirror was updated in June for the
D-I Buster Alpha 3 release. I see those mirrors for HK in choose-mirror
2.91:
| Site: ftp.hk.debian.org
| Site: mirror.xtom.com.hk
| Site: openbsd.hk
So it seems the rackspace mirror hasn't been registered?
FWIW the list is updated from this URL:
  https://salsa.debian.org/mirror-team/masterlist/raw/master/Mirrors.masterlist
so you might want to get in touch with the mirror team to get it
considered for inclusion?
If you're asking about stable, we haven't been updating choose-mirror
for point releases. I think I'm fine with discussing whether we could or
should do it, but that would mean being extra sure no typos or extra
fields could make choose-mirror misbehave in stable. I'm not sure we
have such guarantees at the moment.
Cheers,
