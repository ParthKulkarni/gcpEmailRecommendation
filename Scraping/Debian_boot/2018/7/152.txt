This is quite complete. Also, the installer now does LVM encrypted
install with a simple click. So I think this bug report can be closed :)
I usually say "feel free to reopen or ask me to do it if you see the bug
again", but in this case I think the improvements to the doc should
start from the current situation.
Cheers,
