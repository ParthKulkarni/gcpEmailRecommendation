Source: debian-installer-netboot-images
Version: 20170615+deb9u4
Severity: wishlist
Hi,
As a first stab at fixing dini's FTBFS in stable after a point release
has happened (we build against s-p-u before the point release, but d-i
disappears from there after the point release), I've implemented a fall
back to stretch if stretch-proposed-updates doesn't have the requested
d-i version.
More details in the original report:
  https://bugs.debian.org/902226
Right now, this fallback will take place for each build, that is: for
each architecture.
It would be way better to have an early detection, and to stick to the
relevant distribution all way through. We could have an early test with
a given arch (say, amd64), maybe?
Setting severity to wishlist at the moment, even if that's about adding
a notable improvement over a bug fix for a(n admittedly) serious bug.
Cheers,
--
