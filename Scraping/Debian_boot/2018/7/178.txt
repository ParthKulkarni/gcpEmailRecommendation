Hey folks,
Discussing with highvoltage earlier in the week, we thought it would
be helpful if the isolinux boot menu that d-i starts with was more
explicit about being BIOS mode. The Grub equivalent for UEFI boot
already explicitly mentions UEFI. So, I'm looking at the following
change:
diff --git a/build/boot/x86/menu.cfg b/build/boot/x86/menu.cfg
index 2e270f306..207934e8c 100644
--- a/build/boot/x86/menu.cfg
+++ b/build/boot/x86/menu.cfg
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@

+menu hshift 4
+menu width 70
 
-menu title ${BEEP}Debian GNU/Linux installer boot menu
+menu title ${BEEP}Debian GNU/Linux installer menu (BIOS mode)
 include ${SYSDIR}stdmenu.cfg
 include ${SYSDIR}gtk.cfg
 include ${SYSDIR}txt.cfg
I've had to change the sizing and positioning of the boot menu to make
things fit. Before I commit the above, I just want to see if anybody
objects! (Worried I may be breaking accessibility or automatic testing
things that care about the specific layout/text of the boot menu.)

 occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them
 unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary."  -- James D. Nicoll
