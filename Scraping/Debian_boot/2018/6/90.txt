Your package has been put into the NEW queue, which requires manual action
from the ftpteam to process. The upload was otherwise valid (it had a good
OpenPGP signature and file hashes are valid), so please be patient.
Packages are routinely processed through to the archive, and do feel
free to browse the NEW queue[1].
If there is an issue with the upload, you will receive an email from a
member of the ftpteam.
