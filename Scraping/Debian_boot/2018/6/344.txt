I think this is a glitch in the l10n-sync script. Given that these
strings are in sublevel 1 in the package's POT files AND in the master
files, they are NOT automatically moved to SL2.
My aadvice would be to :
- manually drop them from the package's templates.pot file
- run debconf-updatepo in the paackage (not mandatory, just helps
checking that the proper comments go to the templates.pot file)
- manually drop them from the sublevel 1 POT file
- run l10n-sync script again
--> then they should be moved to sublevel 2 POT file and PO files
