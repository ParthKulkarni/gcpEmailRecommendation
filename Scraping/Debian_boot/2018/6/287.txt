The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the third alpha
release of the installer for Debian 10 "Buster".
Improvements in this release
============================
 * apt-setup:
    - If installing from a single-desktop single CD image, comment it out
      from sources.list after installation like we do with the netinst
      images, along with an explanation in comment as well.
 * cryptsetup:
    - Upgrade to upstream version 2.0.0.
 * debian-installer:
    - Bump Linux kernel ABI from 4.13.0-1 to 4.16.0-2.
    - Replace c_rehash with openssl rehash (#895074). That should only
      affect builds with SSL_CERTS enabled; regular HTTPS support
      comes from ca-certificates anyway.
    - Ensure stricter separation from host's apt configuration by
      setting APT_CONFIG during the build process.
    - Tweak Acquire::Languages, Apt::Architecture, Apt::Architectures
      and disable both apt.conf.d and preferences.d snippets.
    - Drop libnewt0.52 from Build-Depends, the library now provides
      an udeb.
    - Run fc-cache when /etc/fonts or /usr/share/fonts exist (for gtk
      targets), to avoid having to generate UUIDs at runtime, which
      can be hard because of missing entropy (#898468).
 * debian-installer-utils:
    - Fix "list-devices partition" to also report LVM logical volumes
      (#868848).
 * debootstrap:
    - Add support for bookworm.
    - Add Acquire-By-Hash support.
    - Too many other improvements to list them all here.
 * espeakup:
    - Fix path to voice definitions, which fixes language auto-switch
      in the installer.
    - Configure debconf frontend to readline on the installed system
      for better accessibility.
    - Improve console/X11 VT switches.
 * flash-kernel:
    - Fix issues in handle_dtb (#870430).
    - Add option to allow "any" in Kernel-Flavors (#883547).
    - Warn when ubootenv.d snippet will be ignored (#884376).
    - Adjust sunxi boot script to prefer prefix variable if defined.
    - Add support for relative paths for DTB-Id (#860304).
    - Add compatibility symlink to dtb in vendor sub-directory.
    - Add support for root device specified by PARTLABEL.
    - Provide hook to start EFI application (#873390).
    - Fix when no Kernel-Flavors are defined (#887803).
    - Add support for Boot-Kernel-Path-Version,
      Boot-Initrd-Path-Version, and Boot-DTB-Path-Version
 * iso-scan:
    - Detect LVM logical volumes so that they can be used to find the
      ISO image being looked for (#868859).
    - Copy the ISO image into RAM before mounting it when debconf
      question iso-scan/copy_iso_to_ram is true. This makes it
      possible to use the disk that provided the ISO image for
      (automatic) partitioning (#868900).
 * localechooser:
    - Use iso_3166-1.mo filename instead of the compatibility symlink
      (#889963).
    - languagelist: Enable Georgian and Lao in bterm.
    - Enable all languages when using speakup_soft, which supports any
      UTF-8 language.
    - Enable all languages when using speakup_dummy too, which can
      also support any UTF-8 language.
 * mdadm:
    - Use the same udev rules in the installer and in the installed
      system.
 * partman-lvm:
    - Make device_remove_lvm() detect errors, so as to stop early if
      anything goes wrong.
 * ppp:
    - Use /bin/ip instead of /sbin/ifconfig in the interfaces
      configuration for the installed system (#889295).
    - Consider interface names using udev predictable interface
      naming (#873391).
 * rescue:
    - Make sure to not provide duplicate entries in the list of
      possible devices for the root partition.
 * util-linux:
    - Ship fallocate in util-linux-udeb (#882001).
 * wide-dhcpv6:
    - Build against static flex library to avoid a runtime dependency
      on libfl2 (#893988).

Localization status
===================
 * 75 languages are supported in this release.
 * Full translation for 9 of them.
Known bugs in this release
==========================
 * The installer will be using the Stretch theme until the artwork
   selection for Buster has happened.
 * The translation-status file wasn't updated for this release, so the
   language selection step might misrepresent the actual translation
   status for some languages.
See the errata[2] for details and a full list of known issues.
Feedback for this release
=========================
We need your help to find bugs and further improve the installer,
so please try it. Installer CDs, other media and everything else you
