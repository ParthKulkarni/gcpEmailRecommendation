Hi,
just noticed there are two scripts at dillon
	~d-i/bin/generate_l10n-stats
	~d-i/bin/push-www
which are also in our d-i repo, but at dillon they are regular files, but with 
identical content (so being duplicates).
Is there a reason, why that's no symlinks to
	trunk/scripts/bin/generate_l10n-stats
and
	trunk/scripts/bin/push-www
instead ?
Holger
