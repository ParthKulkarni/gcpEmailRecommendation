Ok, thanks.
How can find out, if there are more such packages?
(brltty is missing in our l10n statistics, so more translators may be
not aware of such waiting translation work for d-i.)
I cannot search for "udeb" at packages.d.o
Is there a complete list of packages, on which d-i depends/which are used
by d-i?
Holger
