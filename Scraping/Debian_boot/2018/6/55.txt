That's exactly what's needed to reverse the check! :)
The original/final lines are a bit strange, though, instead of having:
  if $($git foo bar); then â€¦ fi
I suppose it should only be:
  if $git foo bar; then â€¦ fi
Since $() is used to introduce a command substitutionâ€¦
(e.g. echo "I'm working on $(hostname)")
Also wondering if it makes sense to keep $git a variable instead of just
using git everywhere. Maybe we used to require a specific $svn, but I
won't be doing any archeology tonight.

I'll handle this (repo+relevant jobs) when I have some spare time, don't
worry about those.
