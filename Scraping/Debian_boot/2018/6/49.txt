I've seen your commit but this isn't live yet. ;)

Modifying the git repository isn't sufficient (as we might want to tweak
the crontab entries without a commit; at least we've been doing that
from time to time). We would need to update the copy on dillon in d-i's
home directory; switching it from svn to git in the process. I can't
really commit to doing so right away though. Note there's ‚Äúmake check‚Äù
and ‚Äúmake install‚Äù available thanks to scripts/Makefile, to list the
diff between what's in dillon's crontab and what's in $VCS.

Right. You should get at least this:
| User kibi may run the following commands on dillon:
|     (d-i) ALL
which will let you do things like ‚Äúsudo -u d-i -s‚Äù, which means working
as the d-i user on dillon.
For this you'll likely need to open a ticket on RT:
  https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DSA/RTUsage
Feel free to cc me when requesting getting added to the d-i group, I'll
confirm with a reply (which I think was kind of needed/appreciated last
time I've been in that process).
Thanks for joining!
Cheers,
