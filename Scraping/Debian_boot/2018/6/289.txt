To be honest, I did include this particular version bump to see if that
was sparking any reaction/interest. I happened to notice Matthew Garrett
has been working on some merge requests[1,2] to fix some issues popping
up in d-i specifically.
 1. https://salsa.debian.org/cryptsetup-team/cryptsetup/merge_requests/2
 2. https://salsa.debian.org/debian/argon2/merge_requests/3
I guess you could start by documenting what such a plan should look
like, in a bug report against partman-crypto (which should be a good
starting point I suppose)?

Such a blocker shouldn't last long, enabling an option is usually done
rather quickly if there's no obvious issue/conflict with it. Drafting a
sound plan, then implementing it would be the hard part.
