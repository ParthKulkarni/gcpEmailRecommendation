Dear maintener
I have in posses of the mainboard asus h81m-c witch integrateth ethernet  controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
RTL-8110SC/8169SC Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10).
During the installation the network card is detected but I am unable to
go on because in the iso firmware-9.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso the r8169
firmware is missing as specifically reported in my dmesg of which I copy
here 'under the email.
I request that the missing firmware is inserted in the iso.
Thank you and good day.
This is part of dmesg:
