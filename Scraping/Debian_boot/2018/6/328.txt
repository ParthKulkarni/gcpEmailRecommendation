Right, that allows us to build from s-p-u when catching up with d-i
changes staged into s-p-u, which happens for each and every point
release where d-i gets updated (I don't remember any where it was
skipped, but my memory is not to be trusted), starting right after r0.

Right, see commit 5a0d0847c8a12e2dd3f13ce86aff797f4472dbd6 for stretch;
previous releases should have something similar.

Well, I've seen a fair share of “complaints”, but no solutions, so I
fear this isn't going to be fixed any time soon indeed. Needless to say,
I'm not a huge fan of this specific requirement / policy violation, but
I have yet to see actual, viable solutions. From my rather self-centered
point of view, d-i releases are a sufficient burden already that I don't
wish to make this worse by adding some extra layers of complexity or
indirections.

At first glance, it seems to me this bug could be addressed in two
different ways, which don't seem to be too convoluted. The first way
would be to try the s-p-u download and fall back to s download, for each
and every download. But this could (probably only theoretically) lead to
inconsistent downloads, mixing bits and pieces from s-p-u and from s.
Plus plenty of errors when the default location isn't the right one.
I suppose a better way would be to figure out with an early test if the
target version is available in s-p-u or in s, and then pick the right
suite for all downloads. Patches for this second approach are welcome.
(Currently travelling, not easy to test things needed network access.)
Cheers,
