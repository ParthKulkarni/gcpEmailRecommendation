Attached is a patch which tries to do that.  Unfortunately I could not
test it, since I don't have a local mirror where I could swap the
priorities of mawk and original-awk (or gawk).

Subject: [PATCH] Handle case where some other awk than mawk is required
Set up original-awk or gawk, if they had been downloaded instead of
mawk.  This should make it possible to let either of those have
"Priority: required" and downgrade mawk's priority.
