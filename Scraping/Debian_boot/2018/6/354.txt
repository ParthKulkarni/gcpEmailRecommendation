I don't have the necessary information now. I think the problem was
that when the debootstrap process failed (like say a 404 HTTP error for
any one of the packages), it would later bail out. The logs used to get
stored under the chroot target path, but as part of the clean-up, the
target path used to get wiped.
But there's a comment from Cyril about --keep-debootstrap-dir option.
Maybe I didn't pay close attention to the options back then.
And I can't reproduce it right now. So let's close this for now. If
this is really a common bug, it'll show up again.
Thanks,
Ritesh
