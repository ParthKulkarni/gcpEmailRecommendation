Some options that I'm aware of
* upon boot add "mirror=my.local.mirror" parameter
* have a preseedfile that contains (at least) "mirror=my.local.mirror"
* use expert mode, it will ask everthing, including which mirror to use
* configure a DNS that says[1] ftp.nl.debian.org is at my.local.mirror
Extra benefit of the last option is when the laptop is away from
the local mirror, it can still use what is in /etc/apt/sources.list
