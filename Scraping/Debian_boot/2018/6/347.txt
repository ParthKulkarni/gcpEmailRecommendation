Package: task-desktop
Version: 3.44
Severity: wishlist
Hi!
As much as many of us consider emojis to be a big mistake on part of the
Unicode consortium, it's undeniable that these characters see quite wide
use these days.  Thus, at least one font that convers this range should
be installed by default.
Of these, it seems there are only two general-purpose fonts:
* fonts-symbola (nice)
* ttf-unifont (ugly and pixellated)
There are also fonts that have colourful images instead of glyphs, but these
are unfit for most programs, and are not supported by our current libraries. 
It's an issue of so-called "text presentation" vs "emoji presentation" that,
according to the Unicode standard, programs should select based on
environment being "informal like texting and chats" vs "formal like word
processing" (TR51 ยง4 and ยง2).  Text presentation is also needed when the
character's color is to be set via metadata such as CSS or ANSI SGR.
Thus, even library support issues aside, we need at least one font that
provides text presentation.  Package firefox-esr includes
/usr/lib/firefox-esr/fonts/EmojiOneMozilla.ttf which provides emoji
presentation, but is not available to other programs via fontconfig
for the above reasons.
Thus, please add "Recommends: fonts-symbola" to task-desktop.
