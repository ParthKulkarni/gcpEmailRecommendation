Package: console-setup
Version: 1.184
Severity: normal
console-setup uses 'lsmod' in config script but does not depend on kmod (or a depend package). Thus 'lsmod: not found' messages are thrown when installing console-setup on a minbase install.
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
debootstrap --variant=minbase --include='inetutils-ping,iproute2' sid http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
apt-get update
apt-get install -y dialog libreadline-dev apt-utils
apt-get install -y console-setup
