Using a serial console I was able to get a shell, and to try and start
Xorg manually, which resulted in a symbol error:
| Xorg: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/fbdev_drv.so: undefined symbol: shadowUpdatePackedWeak
Michel Dänzer kindly pointed to this bug report against the fbdev
driver, which is fixed upstream in 0.5.0:
  https://bugs.debian.org/900613
I've merged the new upstream release locally and rebuilt d-i against it,
and I've verified the bug fix is OK; meanwhile, Julien uploaded the new
upstream release:
  https://tracker.debian.org/news/963445/accepted-xserver-xorg-video-fbdev-1050-1-source-into-unstable/
Keeping this bug report open for the time being, until the fbdev driver
migrates to testing, so that I don't try to upload d-i too soon…
Cheers,
