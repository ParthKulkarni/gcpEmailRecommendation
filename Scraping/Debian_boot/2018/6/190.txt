ca-certificates-udeb is used during a debian-installer build, so it
should be fine to unblock it now that the debian-installer upload and
builds have happened, while we're building and checking installation
images.
It seems the block-udeb isn't the only blocker though:
    Migration status: BLOCKED: Rejected/introduces a regression
    Updating ca-certificates introduces new bugs: #895482
and I see no severity downgrade in that bug report?
Also, I should have mentioned this in my dda@ mail I suppose:
    63 days old (needed 5 days)
If a given package has spent that much time out of testing, it probably
can wait a few days while we're going through the late stages of the d-i
release process. It should only be a matter of days or hours now. ;)
I'll get back to your package later if we spot any issues that would
need to be addressed before we release; or it's going to be unblocked
automatically when I unfreeze udebs.
And thanks for following the process. :)
Cheers,
--
