https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Studien/ZufallinVMS/Randomness-in-VMs.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3
has an interesting discussion of the various problems in VMs, but sadly
is also quiet in a bunch of areas because they could not conclusively
deduce *from documentation* what happens with certain hypervisors. On
the other hand they list a bunch of sources we should probably all try
to mix in, on both real and virtualized hardware.
>From a threat model perspective we should not try to defend against an
actively malicious hypervisor. And if people want to very accurately
emulate the hardware so that virtualization is not detectable, they
might not want randomness either / should arrange for it differently if
they need it. So the question is if we can prevent people from shooting
themselves into the foot and making their life actively worse with this
change.
