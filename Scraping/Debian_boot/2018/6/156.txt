I think it is a good idea.

This I don't know, I've run rmadison with no -s parameter in
www-master.d.o and it shows:
installation-guide | 20130503        | oldoldstable       | source
installation-guide | 20150423        | oldstable-kfreebsd | source
installation-guide | 20150423+deb8u3 | oldstable          | source
installation-guide | 20170614        | stable             | source

I think it's a good idea and the script could benefit with this
improvement, and also it may make other improvements easier too
(unhardcode release names, build installation manual for testing and
also for stable).
Shall I create a bug report about "general improvements in the
installation manual script"? (I don't feel I can put time on writing the
patches in the following weeks, but I could try to review, test and/or
deploy if other people contribute them and need/want a second pair of eyes).
Cheers
