Control: tag -1 - pending
Control: tag -1 + patch
Please stop marking bugs as pending as long as they are not merged. The
existence of a merge request is similar to the existence of a patch, it
does not mean that the it has been applied to the git repository.
I told you so twice now, please pay attention to this.

and --unpack-tarball and I'm not sure if your changes are sane. In
particular, I would have expected to not have to modify all scripts
