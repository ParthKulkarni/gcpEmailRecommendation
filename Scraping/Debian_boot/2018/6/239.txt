I'm not sure. ISTR having seen mentioned on IRC that one of the hosts
behind static hit ENOSPC. It might be that some jobs failed to detect
that and are hanging forever since? (ps says started Jun 15.)
Anyway, AFAICT, alioth shouldn't be on the push-to-static path.

Apparently we can only kill the master processes (which I just did),
which then forks and sudoes to staticsync. I don't think child processes
will notice or care, and they might hang aroundâ€¦ I'll get in touch with
debian-admin@ later today.
