Since this version of cryptsetup adds support for dm-integrity
(https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/DMIntegrity), are
there any plans to eventually support it in the installer so that I
can have a root partition with checksums on all data and metadata?
However, unfortunately for now bug #896649 would be a blocker anyway
since the kernel option CONFIG_DM_INTEGRITY is not yet enabled in
the standard Debian kernel.
