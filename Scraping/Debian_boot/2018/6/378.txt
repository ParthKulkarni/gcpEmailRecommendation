Hi Rapha√´l,

ACK, thanks for the notice.

I think it really should get reviewed through the usual channel
(debian-l10n-english@ if memory serves, but don't trust me on this), so
that we avoid common errors.

The use of ‚Äúyou‚Äù seems to be one of the common errors I mentioned above.
We tend to avoid pointing fingers at users.
Hrm. Grepping across our packages' templates, I see a lot of ‚Äúyou‚Äùs so I
might just be misremembering. Or maybe we've tried hard not to introduce
new occurrences while not actively fixing pre-existing entries.
Cheers,
