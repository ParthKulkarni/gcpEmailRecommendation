Hi Cyril,
Thanks for the clarification.
I am subscribed to the debian-announce list, and I read the message you mention when it first came out.  It doesn’t (at least to my eyes, I may be missing something) say anything specific about security.debian.org.
What do you suggest I do?  Should I just comment out the security.debian.org line in my sources.list?
Thanks,
Rick
