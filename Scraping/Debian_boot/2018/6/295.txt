It happens whenever the kernel gets updated with a new ABI; we don't
re-upload d-i every time, the mini.iso in buster will therefore only
work until that first update.

If you really want to use mini.iso, you can pick dailies (built against
unstable) from:
  https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/
> Note: I can't install from kvm too:
> $ kvm -m 1024 -vga std -drive file=debian10.raw,format=raw -cdrom
> mini.iso -boot d
Using a released netinst image (instead of netboot) would give you
greater reliability. You'll find those linked from:
  https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
Latest alpha for buster (D-I Buster Alpha 3) was released a few days
ago. Direct link for the amd64 image:
  https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/buster_di_alpha3/amd64/iso-cd/debian-buster-DI-alpha3-amd64-netinst.iso
Since what you reported is a known limitation, closing this bug report.
