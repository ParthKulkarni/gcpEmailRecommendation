This would benefit from an extra comma before "as".  I'd like to make
it clear that it's the installing rather than the reviewing that's
done "using standard package management tools", but I don't think a
comma helps with that... maybe instead it should have an explicitly
contrasting "before manual installation [...]"?

Comma-spliced sentences; make the second one a subclause, "which will
install".

Another complicated unpunctuated sentence.  Make the two kinds of
"rare case" more parallel - instead of a "where" and a "when", make
them both "where"s.
"Backwards compatible" is slightly commoner in en-GB and "backward
compatible" in en-US; for debconf prompts the d-l-e standard is to
prefer en-US.  Either way, a hyphen would help.
So:
_Description: Updates management on this system:
 Applying updates on a frequent basis is an important part of keeping the
 system secure.
 .
 By default, security updates are not automatically installed, as security
 advisories should be reviewed before manual installation of the updates
 using standard package management tools.
 .
 Alternatively the unattended-upgrades package can be installed, which will
 install security updates automatically. Note however that automatic
 installation of updates may occasionally cause unexpected downtime of
 services provided by this machine in the rare cases where the update is
 not fully backward-compatible, or where the security advisory requires the
 administrator to perform some other manual operation.
