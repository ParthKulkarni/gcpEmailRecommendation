Package: src:debian-installer-netboot-images
Severity: wishlist
Hi,
The debian-installer-*-netboot-* packages currently explicitly filter
out mini.iso by way of an explicit "grep -v mini.iso", which according
to git history has always been the case.
One use case for having mini.iso files on hosts would be to have them
available on a VM host, to allow for easy installations of the VM guests
(just point to mini.iso as the file to boot from, and pronto). Having
them be installed by package by the VM host would mean they're always
up-to-date.
I'd like to see that filtering out of mini.iso removed. Downside is that
it would approximately double the size of the packages, since the
mini.iso contains everything that's in the netboot.tar.gz, but I think
the advantage outweighs that minor downside.
Thoughts?
