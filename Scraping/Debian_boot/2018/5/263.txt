Please don't mark the bug as pending when you submit a merge request. It
means that the bug has a patch but not that the fix has been committed to
git.
BTW, I enabled a webhook that will do this automatically when commits
are pushed to master and when they contain a "Closes: #xxx" in the commit
message.

Done. It's not the same as suggested in the bug.
