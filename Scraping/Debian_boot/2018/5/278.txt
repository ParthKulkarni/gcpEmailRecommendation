Package: debian-installer
Severity: serious
Justification: unresponsive d-i
Hi,
Trying a build against the new linux ABI, I've just discovered another
issue with the graphical installer. It just shows a black screen, which
is tracked in #898468 already (which reminds me I need to follow up
there with my findings). Unfortunately the issue seems more severe now
as X doesn't react to ctrl-alt-fN key strokes, making it hard(er) to
debug what's happening.
Going back to the previous linux ABI shows the same behaviour (so both
4.16.0-1 and 4.16.0-2 are affected), so I suppose it could be due to the
new X server. It seems to start at least, since I'm briefly seeing its
startup logs.
Interested people could look at images from the last few days and check
the differences in build logs for further suspects:

For this bug:
 - OK = ctrl-alt-fN can switch ttys. You'll likely see messages about
        “random” things (see #898468).
 - KO = ctrl-alt-fN doesn't seem to have any effects.
Cheers,
