Hello,
I just enabled two things for all our repositories:
- "Emails on push" integration with tracker.debian.org so that
  one can receive git commit notifications through the vcs keyword
  with usual package subscription on the package tracker
- the "tagpending" webhook which marks bugs as "pending" when you
  push/merge commits that contain "Closes: #xxx" in their description
Cheers,
