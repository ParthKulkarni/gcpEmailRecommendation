Package: preseed
Version: 20180504
Severity: wishlist
The preseed file I have been using (for quite a few releases now) relies
on the behavior documented at
 https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/apbs02.html.en#preseed-auto
where if url= does not list a protocol then http is assumed, and does
not end in / then default path is added.
I was trying to debug something and was looking through the preseed
source and realized that package/preseed/01-auto-install.t could use a
couple more test cases:
1) url= with a bare hostname like "url=server.example.org"
2) url= with a bare IP like "url=10.0.0.5"
3) I guess IPv6 is possible too? "url=fd00:9:152:48:1822:ffff:162:199"
(or maybe it's "url=[fd00:9:152:48:1822:ffff:162:199]"?)
Thanks,
