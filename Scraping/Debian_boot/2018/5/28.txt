Hi again,
so it's 2018 and I've already booted quite a few machines with this patch, so 
it comes the time to ask, whether it could be included in netcfg now?
As posted above, if the switch is configured in 802.3ad active mode, the 
machines has to reply to the config frames before the link can be used to send 
regular data.
Without it, the machine is unfortunately not auto bootable.
Cheers
Michal
