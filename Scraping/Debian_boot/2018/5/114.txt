Hi Miroslav,
your Czech translation for the Debian installation-guide is still xml-based,
while most other translations have been converted to po file format in the
meantime.
The workflow for xml-based translation is based on the svn revision numbers, 
which are no longer available now, since the repository has been moved to git.
Because of that, there is now a problem to get this workflow running again
for git.
Do you have any objections against the conversion to po format for Czech?
For po format we have a possible way to get the workflow running again.
Regards
Holger
