I'm fine with any pick.
I don't think we have any pending ABI bump for linux (this time), and
the stretch branch in debian-installer.git seems quiet, so binNMUing d-i
might be sufficient. I might have missed pu requests for d-i components
though, but hopefully debian-boot@ will correct me if I'm wrong on this.
Cheers,
