Package: installation-reports
Boot method: CD
Image version: 
https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/buster_di_alpha2/amd64/iso-cd/debian-buster-DI-alpha2-amd64-netinst.iso
I'm not yet finished to install, but I want to report a possible 
understanding problem.
When I was asked to set the proxy I have write all the http string and 
probably I have made a typo in that string. The error that I have 
(Ctrl-Alt-F4) was that the mirror selected is not supporting the buster 
repository. So I have try different mirrors, then I try to see if there 
is some problem with the DNS, I try to set the proxy in a console and 
try to execute manually the command (wget ... Release | grep ...),  etc, 
etc, and finally I have checked the proxy string; it seem correct to me 
so I have try again other things... and last I have deleted and 
rewritten the proxy string and all have start to work.
I think that this error message is not correct/complete. I think, if it 
is impossible to detect if the proxy work, it must have alternative 
causes that can cause this problem, something like: probably the mirror 
you have selected do not support buster or you have insert a wrong proxy 
string or...
Ciao
