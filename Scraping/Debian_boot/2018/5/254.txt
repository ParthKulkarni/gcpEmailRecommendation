Package: console-setup
Version: 1.164
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***
   * What led up to the situation?
I rebooted the computer.
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
Not sure what is meant by this question, but if I set the font
via dpkg-reconfigure console-setup then reboot the computer the
font settings are not kept and I have to do another dpkg-reconfigure
to get it back.
Please note that before filing this report I had already done a dpkg-reconfigure console-setup.
