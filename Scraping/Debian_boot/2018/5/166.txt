Hi Moritz,

No worries, I know the feeling; and thanks for the detailed answer!
Replying only briefly (for similar reasons):

Sorry about the fallouts. I can't say for sure but ISTR I only found out
about this change when preparing a release announcement, even if there
were prior discussions in other channels (debian-devel@). The security
team should have been looped in, and I'm sorry I didn't think of it at
the time, even after the fact (= right after a D-I Alpha was published).
debian-boot@: the requested revert looks fine to me, bonus points if it
comes with a (short) summary of these reasons in changelog, so that they
can be emphasized in the release announcement. :)
Thanks to everyone involved.
Cheers,
