Package: console-setup
Version: 1.184
Tags: patch
Hi,
After upgrading the console-setup package to version 1.184 to get the fix for 
bug #895047 [1], I found that the issue was still there. I had to remove the 
cached font in /etc/console-setup and then run 'setupcon --save' in order to 
finally get rid of it.
It turned out that findfile() function used 'ls' to get available file matches, 
and then simply picked the first one. But 'ls' sorts its output alphabetically 
by default, hence the cached font in /etc always won despite the normal one 
being available in /usr. As the result, setupcon never updated the cached font 
while always using it for setting up ttys, rendering font updates (like the 
one in #895047) useless.
A proposed fix is attached.

Subject: [PATCH] setupcon: Make findfile() respect location priorities
findfile() used 'ls' to create a list of available file matches, and
then picked the first one. But 'ls' sorts the result alphabetically
which led to findfile() always picking the cached version in /etc even
if the normal one was available.
As one of the consequences, the cached font was not updated on package
upgrades. Given that the cached version was used all of the time, any
font updates in the new version of the package had no effect until one
manually removed the cached one.
This commit makes findfile() respect the given order of possible file
paths, which fixes the issues. It moves away from using 'ls' (which
doesn't have a usable and portable way to switch off sorting) to a
POSIX-compliant for-loop.
