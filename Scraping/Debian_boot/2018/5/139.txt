 While I had fixed some bug reports and added some bugs ;) in 
debootstrap,
 Any comments? If there's no objection, I'll set it to debootstrap 
repo.
I think what would be useful is coming up with a bunch of test cases and 
adding them to Gitlab's CI feature.
Personally I think that for changes you are not sure about, you propose 
the merge request and assign it to a reviewer. This might or might not 
require some liberal adding of reviewers to the project, though. I know 
Debian doesn't usually roll on code reviews, but of course I don't 
disagree that they would be useful. But I don't think the solution is 
"allow to push" -> "no one". Gitlab doesn't stop you from doing the 
reviews anyway even if that's not set.
Kind regards
