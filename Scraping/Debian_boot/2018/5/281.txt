Hi,
I noticed that apex and nis are currently testing despite the
auto-remover wanting to remove them (#865585 and #862778).  At the
moment, they are (only) retained due to a constraint that ensures that
d-i's packages are all present and installable.
Please have a look at these packages and let us know if this constraint
is still relevant.  Particularly, apex looks rather concerning with the
bug (#865585) being filed in Jun 2017 with no maintainer follow up at all.
Thanks,
~Niels
