Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.110
Severity: wishlist
Tags: patch
User: md@linux.it
Usertags: usrmerge
As discussed in <https://bugs.debian.org/913229> and the debian-devel
thread starting at <https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/11/msg00299.html>,
buildd chroots should not be generated with merged /usr. However, this
is now the default in stretch-backports' debootstrap, which buildds
apparently use.
Avoiding merged /usr for buildds mitigates a frequently-seen class of
bugs in which packages end up with wrong executable paths hard-coded,
for example /usr/bin/bash or /bin/apt-get (which would both work fine
on a merged-/usr system, but not on an unmerged-/usr system).
I've proposed a patch to dsa-puppet that explicitly disables merged /usr
for buildd chroots (#914204) and I already had a similar patch accepted
into sbuild-createchroot, but I think it might also be wise to make
--variant=buildd default to --no-merged-usr? That would avoid having to
patch everything that creates a buildd chroot.
In the attached patch, --variant=buildd produces an unmerged-/usr chroot,
but --variant=buildd --merged-usr still produces a merged-/usr chroot.

Subject: [PATCH] Disable merged /usr by default when making a buildd chroot
Merged /usr is known to cause multiple packages to be misbuilt. As long
as we support unmerged /usr for user systems, we should mitigate
this class of bugs by using unmerged-/usr chroots on official buildds,
resulting in binary packages that work equally well on merged- or
unmerged-/usr user systems.
