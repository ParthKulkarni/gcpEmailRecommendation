Hi,
Busybox provides a dhcp client (udhcpc) and a dhcp server (udhcpd).
On packages website, first is referenced as :
https://packages.debian.org/stretch/udhcpc
The server udhcpd have not specific debian package. Is it possible to 
create a virtual package as the client udhcpc ?
It could help to solve a mistake in french webpage of udhcpc.
Best regards,
Luc Novales.
