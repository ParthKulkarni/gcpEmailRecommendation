Hi I confirm that bug exists also in my environment.
Addtionaly if I change parmline to init=bin/sh, reboot and try to list
files - only one line is displayed. Doesn't matter how many files
exists. 
For example: 
ls -1 /
gives only 
bin
and 
ls /
displays  only
   bin     etc     initrd  media   proc    run     sys     usr
and 
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
displays only first line of the file.
Boot was done from Debian 9.5 ISO, hercules version 3.12.
Hope that it helps
Piotr
