This seems to go into more technical detail than is necessary, and the
use of long parentheticals makes it hard to read.  I would like to
suggest a shorter explanation:
--- BEGIN ---
Unless you chose not to use a network mirror, you will be presented
with a list of network mirrors based upon your country selection
earlier in the installation process. Choosing the offered default is
usually fine.
The offered default is deb.debian.org, which is not a mirror itself but
will redirect to a mirror that should be up-to-date and fast. These
mirrors support TLS (https protocol). This service is maintained by the
Debian System Administration (DSA) team.
--- END ---
- Not using a network mirror is very unusual, so I worded the first
sentence accordingly rather than going into detail.
- "Redirection" is not very precise but is far more likely to be
understood than "SRV record".
- From reading the bug log, I think that TLS is not supported by all
mirrors behind deb.debian.org, but if you try to use it you will only
hit mirrors that do support it.
- "TLS" is not as widely understood as the (strictly obsolete) "SSL". 
Adding a mention of "https" should make this clearer.

I have a daily image from October 26th which prompts again for country
before the mirror selection.  The option to specify a mirror by hand is
at the top of the country list.

--- BEGIN ---
The offered default is deb.debian.org, which is not a mirror itself but
will redirect to a mirror that should be up-to-date and fast. These
mirrors support TLS (https protocol) and IPv6. This service is
maintained by the Debian System Administration (DSA) team.
--- END ---
I.e. add "and IPv6" to the second sentence.

Definitely - httpredir.debian.org is now a deprecated alias for
deb.debian.org.
