Dear Hideki, dear src:debootstrap maintainers,
tl;dr: debootstrap maintainers; can you agree to disable "merged /usr" by 
default now, or are you OK letting the TC decide on this subject?
Longer version:
As you might be aware, #914897 (initially filed on src:debootstrap) has now 
been reassigned to the Technical Committee.  As, formally, the Maintainer of 
src:debootstrap is "debian-boot@l.d.o and the current Uploaders", I would like 
to make sure that the TC is not going to overrule unnecessarily.
Hideki, if I read the debootstrap history correctly, you enabled "merged /usr" 
by default in debootstrap 1.0.102.  Given the recent discussion in debian-
devel@ (starting at [0]) and on #914897, could you (or anyone speaking as with 
a "debootstrap maintainer" hat on) state if, either of:
* you would be willing to toggle the "merged /usr" default in debootstrap in a
  subsequent upload;
* you maintain that the "merged /usr" default (to yes) is here to stay.
Many thanks in advance for your consideration,
    OdyX

P.S. I'm aware that this might sound formal, or dismissive of Julien's
     statements.  I just _really_ don't want the TC to eventually overrule
     "the debootstrap maintainers" without need.
