The present "6.3.5.1.3. Choosing a network mirror" at
https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/i386/install.txt.en
has four paragraphs. Each paragraph is treated separately in what
follows and the proposals are based on #797340, #907704 and the daily
i386 testing netinst for 2018-11-09.
Paragraph 1
-----------
Split into two for readability. There should probably be a link to
deb.debian.org.
======================= Patch begins =======================================
If you have selected to use a network mirror during the installation (optional
for CD/DVD/USB installs, required for netboot images), you will be presented with a
list of geographically nearby (and therefore hopefully fast) network mirrors
based upon your country selection earlier in the installation process. Choosing
the offered default is usually fine.
The offered default is deb.debian.org, which does not have packages itself, but
the name has SRV records in the DNS that lets apt find places that do, and then apt
is redirected to an up-to-date and (hopefully) fast host. Note that this mirror also
supports TLS and is under the umbrella of the Debian System Administration (DSA) team.
======================= Patch ends =========================================
Paragraph 2
-----------
There isn't any facility to specify a mirror by hand. This paragraph is
redundant if this is intentional.
Paragraph 3
-----------
I don't know anything about IPv6. If deb.debian.org is IPv6-capable it
could be mentioned in the second half of the first paragraph.
======================= Patch begins =======================================                                           
The offered default is deb.debian.org, which does not have packages itself, but
the name has SRV records in the DNS that lets apt find places that do, and then apt
is redirected to an up-to-date and (hopefully) fast host. Note that this mirror also
supports TLS and takes into account the protocol you connect to it with (if you use
IPv6, it will refer you to an IPv6-capable mirror). deb.debian.org is under the
umbrella of the Debian System Administration (DSA) team.
======================= Patch ends   =======================================
Paragraph 4
-----------
Appears to be redundant.

Brian.
