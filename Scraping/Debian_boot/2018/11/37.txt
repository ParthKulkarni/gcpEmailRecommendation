Hello,
I have the same problem. It seems to be still present in the installer
for Debian 9 (Stretch). If you use preseed_fetch it does not use a
relative path to the URL used for the main preseed script. Instead the
absolute path is used from the file system.
Seems that the patch from John Morrissey could fix it.
