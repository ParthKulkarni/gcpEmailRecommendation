Package: os-prober
Version: 1.76
os-prober writes a lot of hard-to-get-rid-of debug messages into
/var/log/messages. 2 problems:
- The syslog lines lack a common pattern, e.g. "os-prober". Instead
  they log entries for 40grub2, 83haiku, 10qnx, macosx-prober,
  20microsoft, etc. This is extremely difficult to filter and doesn't
  support a dedicated log file. I am forced to disable logging DEBUG
  entries completely.
- The environment variable to disable this (OS_PROBER_DISABLE_DEBUG)
  is neither documented (AFAICS), nor does os-prober support a config
  file to set it.
This should be improved.
Regards
Harri
