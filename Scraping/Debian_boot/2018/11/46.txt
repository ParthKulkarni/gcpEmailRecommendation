package: task-kannada-desktop
version: 3.47
severity: serious
Hi,
task-kannada-desktop depends on 'firefox-esr-l10n-kn | firefox-l10n-kn', which
is not installable on mips and mipsel, because the latest firefox doesn't
build there (yet).
Please move this dependency to recommends, as is done with (most) other
language tasks.
Thanks,
Ivo
