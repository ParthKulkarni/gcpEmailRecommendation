hd-media/boot.img does not contain a partition table, it is just an fs:
$ file boot.img
boot.img: DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x58+2, OEM-ID "SYSLINUX",
sectors/cluster 8, Media descriptor 0xf8, sectors/track 63, heads 255,
sectors 1953120 (volumes > 32 MB) , FAT (32 bit), sectors/FAT 1904,
serial number 0xdeb00001, label: "Debian Inst"
I tried to find support that a partition table is required. The best I
could find this this:
"The following list outlines the advantages of using the GPT disk
layout over the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) disk layout: ..."

And these comments from IRC:
waldi: well, if you boot something without efi partition, it will only
work with csm
"In November 2017, Intel announced that it planned to phase out
support for CSM by 2020."

CarlFK: is there a reason why hd-media/boot.img.gz does not have a
partition table?waldi: maybe because no-one bothered to change it?
