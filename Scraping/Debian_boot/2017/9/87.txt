I'd be happy to do that when rebuilding for translation (I have a
bunch of pending builds to do, because of recent updates for two
languages).
I can probably start doing so as soon as my next race is over and I'm
back to work (it is suppsoed to start in.....6h30...and end on next Sunday).
Of course, it won't cover all D-I packages, but once done for those
with translated material, I can continue with others.
