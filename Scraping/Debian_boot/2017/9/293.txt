And now I have the issue pinned down.
If I do a network install, and I use the ethernet port as the interface 
of choice, the install goes fine.  I can finish up the process overall 
by adding the firmware-realtek package, which provides me with some 
connectivity (actually, sufficient connectivity, even though there 
should be a new wifi driver coming out to accompany the new kernel).
However, when I try the firmware_9.1.0_amd64_netinst.iso image, the wifi 
card is not autodetected on install.  It should be, because 
firmware-realtek comes from nonfree, is supposed to be present to 
support unusual hardware, and the install should just work.  It doesn't.
If my understanding of Debian's organization of these three install 
media (netinst without nonfree firmware, netinst WITH nonfree firmware, 
and debian-live - offline installation with nonfree firmware) as I've 
been using them is correct, then the problem exists in the difference 
between the versions.  Since firmware-9.1.0-amd64-netinstal doesn't work 
as expected, neither will debian-live.  Netinstall should do a basic 
install without potentially extra hardware drivers, the firmware 
derivative of netinstall should add the package firmware-realtek, and 
debian-live should also include the firmware-realtek package while 
enabling offline installation.
I can make where these currently sit work, but it ain't user friendly, 
and I'm dependent upon firmware-realtek being present, which will change.
