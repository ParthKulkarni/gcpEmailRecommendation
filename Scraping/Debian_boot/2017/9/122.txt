Package: partman-auto
Severity: wishlist
When people select the guided partitioning, the list of possible
partitions is very restricted (all in one, root+home or root+home+var+tmp)
It would be useful to have an extra option, "custom", where the user can
see a list:
/ (root)   100%
/home      0%
/var       0%
/tmp       0%
and edit the percentages or replace them with sizes in GB
If they put 0% or 0, that partition/LV would not be created.
For tmp, it would also be useful to have some way to indicate that tmpfs
/ ramdisk should be used (see also bug #245465)
This screen would also show the amount of space free if they don't use
it all.
This would aim to help people with a single disk (or single RAID volume)
and wouldn't need to try and cover use cases where they want to assign
different mounts to different physical volumes or choose individual
filesystem types.
