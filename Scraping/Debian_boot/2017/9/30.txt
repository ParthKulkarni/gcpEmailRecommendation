I don't know which of the errors are fatal.
* usb 1-4 device descriptor read/all, error -71
* Superblock last mount time is in the future.
* tpm [firmware bug] acpi region does not cover the entire
command/response buffer
* wifi firmware failed to load repeated many times.  (I don't have
wifi)  ethernet and it worked during install
* bluetooth hci0 firmware failed to load.  I don't care about
bluetooth.  Everything is wired.
Would appreciate which error(s) are fatal so I can try to address it.
