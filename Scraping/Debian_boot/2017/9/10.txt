thanks for starting the work on the installer that early in the release
process.  Considering our face2face discussion at DebConf I would like
to ask how we could approach a sensible solution for Blends showing up
at install time on the Buster installer.  Do you see any need for
contributions (besides testing) from the Blends team?  Please let us
know how we can contribute.
Kind regards and thanks again for your continuous work
      Andreas.
