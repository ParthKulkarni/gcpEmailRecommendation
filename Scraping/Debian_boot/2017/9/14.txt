Hi,
And thanks for your commits on the l10n side! The following issue was
noted in jenkins/#debian-boot:
| msgfmt -c --statistics -o locale/sq/LC_MESSAGES/win32-loader.mo po/sq.po
| po/sq.po:111: 'msgid' and 'msgstr' entries do not both end with '\n'
| msgfmt: found 1 fatal error
| 66 translated messages.
| Makefile:25: recipe for target 'templates/sq.nsh' failed
Julien marked this entry as fuzzy[1] so that it's no longer a blocker,
but then we've got this issue instead:
| Error: can't load same language file twice.
| !include: error in script: "l10n/templates/all.nsh" on line 2347
| Error in script "main.nsi" on line 21 -- aborting creation process
| Makefile:144: recipe for target 'win32-loader.exe' failed
| make[2]: *** [win32-loader.exe] Error 1
which I've fixed by setting the filename for sq.po to "Albanian.nlf"[2].

 2. https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/win32-loader.git/commit/?id=65148a6
It'd be nice to double check other languages as well, along with fixing
the newly-fuzzy entry. The following files look fishy:
| (sid-amd64-devel)kibi@armor:~/debian-installer/packages/win32-loader$ grep -A1 English.nlf l10n/po/*.po|grep 'msgstr.*English'
| l10n/po/bn.po:msgstr "English.nlf"
| l10n/po/dz.po:msgstr "English.nlf"
| l10n/po/km.po:msgstr "English.nlf"
| l10n/po/ta.po:msgstr "English.nlf"
KiBi.
