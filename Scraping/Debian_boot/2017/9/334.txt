I wonder if fontdiff [1] might help compare renders. The existing tool
would not be usable for this bug, as it compares two fonts (probably two
different versions of the same font is the intended usage). But it does
the comparison using two generated image files. So if you have two
images (one from the old installer, one from the new installer) maybe
there is code in this tool that you could expose to the command line to
compare the already generated images.
