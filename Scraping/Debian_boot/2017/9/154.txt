Ok, so here's my set of patches. Relevant to this bug are the first and
the last one. The other commits are other random improvements that I merged
from Ubuntu that looked like useful.
I tested the attached patches on modified mini.iso where I force-injected
pkgsel and bootstrap-base (because I could not manage to get anna to
reload the modified templates if I installed the new pkgsel manually once
the installer was started up to the configure network step).
Reviews are welcome.
Cheers,
