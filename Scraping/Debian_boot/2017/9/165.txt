Doh. Some history is vanishing out..... Admitedly, I could have tried
some negotiation and propose to add "kibi" and "lamby" to this list
but let's face it: I'm no longer a heavy tester of D-I and I also
think that tbm will not whine either. I didn't even remember about
this hack...:-)
IIRC, there are a few other Eater Eggs here or there in D-I, but I
won't help finding them (mostly because I don't remember about them).
Patch applied. I'm rebuilding user-setup (it had to be done for i18n
pruposes anyway) and will upload it ASAP.
