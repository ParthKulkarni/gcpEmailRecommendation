Yes, let me explain. That was just because at that point it was clear
that the bugs are in that version, no checks for older versions were
made. Then you did further work, and found the jessie and stretch
version as well as affected. So only later updated the BTS with the
repsective other found versions. Hope this explains. But we are maybe
side-tracking the SRM now, so I shut up!
Regards and thanks for your work!
