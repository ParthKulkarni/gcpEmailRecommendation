Package: libxmlrpc-core-c3-udeb
Version: 1.33.14-7
Severity: grave
Tags: d-i
Justification: renders package unusable
Hi,
Your recent udeb addition (which isn't explained in the changelog save
for a link to a lengthy launchpad entry) is broken anyway, your package
depends on:
| Depends: libc6-udeb (>= 2.24), libcurl3
which can't be satisfied in a udeb context.
Also, it would be nice to contact debian-boot@ (x-d-cc'd) before semi
randomly adding udebs, so that we know about them in advance rather than
after the fact.
Also: What purpose is this udeb supposed to serve? (Keeping the delta
between Ubuntu and Debian minimal isn't an appropriate answer.)
KiBi.
