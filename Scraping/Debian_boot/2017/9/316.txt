This was fixed in the recent upload to unstable/sid which already
migrated to testing/buster. Since the ntpd module is not enabled in
Debian's busybox build, it's basically a change in unsued sources that
wasn't worth being mentioned in the changelog. For the same reason this
will not be handled in (old){0,2}stable.
Now closing.
