Package: debian-installer
Severity: wishlist
The installer currently asks the user to select their keyboard layout
from a list.
Sometimes the user or person doing the installation doesn't know the
name/country for their keyboard layout.
It would be useful to offer some type of keyboard identification wizard
that takes them through a series of questions to identify their keyboard
and then asks them to press some keys (like "z" and "/") to see if they
are correctly recognized.
