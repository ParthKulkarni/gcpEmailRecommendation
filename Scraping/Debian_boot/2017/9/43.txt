What about the following:
  $ make -C d-i/source/console-setup/Keyboard $(pwd)/d-i/source/console-setup/Keyboard/KeyboardNames.pl
The full path is required because of the following.  I found that it is 
very difficult to guarantee that a parallel build of console-setup with 
recursive make invocations is bug-free.  Therefore console-setup no 
longer uses recursive makefiles but includes all makefiles into one huge 
Makefile.  In order to guarantee that no target collisions will appear, 
the targets include the full path.
