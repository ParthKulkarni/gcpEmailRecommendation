Package: debian-installer
Severity: normal
this is a follow-up to #873862 , see there for most details.
So, the outcome is, when the installer fails with the problem mentioned
there, I can still reboot the system.
But then, the d-i is basically stuck at the same step. The LUKS
partition is not displayed as LUKS or crypto but "unused". There is no
way to tell it "this is crypto, unencrypt it only". The only
sensible option in the usage types is apparently "PV for encryption". But
then, nothing asks me for the password, instead it presents me a list of
cryptsetup parameters. Hard to tell for a normal user whether it did
detect LUKS or not.
When I go to the main partman menu, there is the option "configure
crypto volumes".  But it does NOT configure the existing one. It only
offers me the choice "create a new crypto volume" and "go back". This is
pretty ... useless if I want to keep existing data.
So apparently the d-i is inept to use the same device setup that it has
created before or there is maybe no LUKS detection whatsoever?
When I try to investigate later with Ubuntu Live, the file manager shows
the encrypted volume and lets me unencrypt it with a a double-click and
it even detects and scans the LVM and registers LVs there). It doesn't
redisplay the discovered PVs in the filemanager, though, but I can mkfs
and mount them manually.
Regards,
Eduard.
