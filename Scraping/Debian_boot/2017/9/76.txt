I didn't used a profiler. I just look at the code and saw that the
/var/lib/dpkg/available files is read several times, and that often
only certains lines are needed. Using grep is much faster that doing
this with perl. I also replaced a loop with a perl hash and moved an
expression which always evaluates to the same value out of a loop.
But read the commit mails of the patches, they explain a lot in
detail.
I also tried to optimize some perl regex, but my tests didn't gain a
notable improvement, so if left the regex unchanged.
