Hi,
Recently I have noticed that there is no login prompt on my consoles.
X11 starts and I can use my system (I can also start a gui console).
I have upgraded my system to Debian 9 and hoped to get this issue solved 
seamlessly. However, there is still no prompt.
I googled and found only one possibility: something stays in the 
foreground at startup. But I do not find anything.
Thanks for your suggestions,
Tamas
