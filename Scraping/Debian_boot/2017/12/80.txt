Package: console-setup-linux
Version: 1.160
Severity: wishlist

I am trying to configure a framebuffer with 720 pixel width to have
exactly 80 columns in text mode.  The perfect font width would be 9
pixels.
Digging into console-setup, I found that it actually ships with 15x9
BDFs.  Quoting Fonts/Makefile:
Fixed15-BDFS := 9x15-IL2.bdf+9x15.bdf+9x15c.bdf
However, all variants with Fixed15 face actually have a width of 8
pixels:
$ file Lat15-Fixed15.psf
Lat15-Fixed15.psf: Linux/i386 PC Screen Font v1 data, 256 characters, Unicode directory, 8x15
This is because Fixed15 is not in ALL_FB_FONT_NAMES and therefore,
bdf2psf is *not* called with the --fb argument when generating the psf
from the BDFs.
I sort of wonder if this is actually a bug/oversight?
Is Fixed15 supposed to have size 15x8?  If no, the fix would be to add
it to the list of FB fonts.  However, such a "fix" would change the size
of a font which is likely in use by users, and would result in their
screen dimensions changing on them.
Therefore, I suggest to add a new face called Fixed15x9.  The only
difference to Fixed15 is, that --fb is passed to bdf2psf, which avoids
cropping the width down to 8 pixels.
