Forwarding this to Ubuntu-l10n-mar list <ubuntu-l10n-mar@lists.ubuntu.com>:
Hi,
maybe someone on the list has some time to spent on debian-installer 
translation?
I know this is a Ubuntu list, but since Ubuntu is based on Debian, Ubuntu would
benefit from Debian translations as well. So maybe someone here is willing to 
help us?
You can use the Weblate webfrontend for translating:
