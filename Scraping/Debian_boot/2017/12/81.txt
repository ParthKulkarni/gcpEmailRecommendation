When Fixed15 is used while the graphic card is in text mode (not 
framebuffer), the font works as 15x9.  However, it has to be packaged as 
15x8 because of the way the hardware/the kernel driver work.

Indeed.  These days people most likely use framebuffer so it makes sense 
to improve the framebuffer support.  Fixed15 is not the only x9 font.  
TerminusBoldVGA is another nice font which is developed as x9 font but 
is packaged as x8.  Also all x8 VGA fonts and the non-bold Terminus font 
are designed to look ok if they are used as x9 fonts.
