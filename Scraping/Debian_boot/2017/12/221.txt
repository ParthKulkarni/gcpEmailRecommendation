Hi,
Indeed - the above was done exactly so people could tinker with it and
submit bugs/patches to (among other) d-i.
  Please note that at the moment the packages still contains the
original keyring files in the original locations, so the existing setup
should still work as usual (except that the deb + udeb are "slightly
larger than they need to be").
Thanks,
~Niels
