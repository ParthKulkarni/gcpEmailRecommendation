Hi Christoph,
Expanding a bit on my quick replies from yesterday on IRC, while I was
debugging & fixing a critical regression for the upcoming D-I Buster
Alpha 2 release (see #883361).

Mailing debian-boot@ for changes affecting d-i is definitely the right
thing to do, but cc'ing kibi@ as well is a good way to make sure I
notice any given notifications, requests, patches, etc.
Now, for these specific requests (which I noticed because I was already
a recipient of the stretch-pu and jessie-pu bug reports), there was
definitely no time for me to process them in time for the *-pu freeze
happening this week-end; reasons include travelling to mini-DebConfs,
release team sprint, debugging the busybox vs. environment variable
issue, the LVM one, and also testing glibc changes.
Handling those bug reports is on my short-term todo list, along with the
brand new systemd one; hopefully I'll manage to get stuff tested next
week.
Thanks for your work & for your patience.
KiBi.
