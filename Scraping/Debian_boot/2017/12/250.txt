I am a atypical user.
I currently multi-boot among five instances of Jessie and Stretch.
The only OS with access to Grub is the one on sda1.
I just did a fresh install of Stretch (Debian 9.1) to sda1 using a 
purchased DVD.
*HOWEVER* I do not recall ever having been asked any questions about 
internet connectivity.
Before doing anything with/to/relating to the copy of Debian on sda1, I 
wish to preserve the *MAXIMUM* amount of installation related data 
related logs.
I will access any file on sda1 via root user of install on a different 
partition.
Having been "Customer Service" in another field, I prefer to "think 
first" rather than "repent at leisure".
P.S. *NOT* using the install on sda in the short term does not cause any 
hardship.
