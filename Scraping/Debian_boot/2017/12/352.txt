Package: libdebian-installer4-udeb
Version: 0.110
Control: affects -1 = anna
Dear Maintainer,
libdebian-installer currently fails when parsing 'Packages' files with
multiple versions of some packages. It results in anna trying to
configure these packages several times and a fatal error.
This error doesn't show up with the patch below applied.
As far as I understand, libdebian-installer parses the stanzas of a 'Packages'
file and store the properties of each package in the fields of a 'package' 
structure. The fields are overwritten when a new stanza describes the 
same package (say, another version) - the last one wins.
libdebian-installer collects references to these 'package' structures in 
two places : a hash table and a slist. 
There is only one element of the hash table for each package. But a new stanza
in the 'Packages' file causes a new pointer to be appended to the slist - even
if the package was already seen.
The patch below avoids appending a seen package to the slist.
Regards,
JH Chatenet
