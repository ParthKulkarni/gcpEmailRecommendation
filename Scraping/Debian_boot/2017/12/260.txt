Hi list,
This mailing list seems more appropriate for this type of questions than 
debian-user.
Press <ENTER> to see video modes available, <SPACE> to continue, or wait 
30 sec"
However, vga=* is deprecated in grub2 and will make your newly 
installation unbootable.
I would prefer not to have to manually correct this issue using rescue 
mode or so on...
Does anyone has any idea on how to avoied that prompt while keeping 
grub2 happy?
In other words: how can I use kernel boot parameter if they are 
deprecated in grub2?
