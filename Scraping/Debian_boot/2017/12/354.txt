Hi,
I realized that bug #885866 just submitted is a duplicate
of #562398 and #801161 - and a special case of #345408
and #345419 (and #389430). 
Perhaps it should be merged with #562398 and #801161.
The behavior of anna and the underlying cause in libdebian-installer
were described in details in :
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=562398#15
and
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=562398#20
The purpose of my patch was to avoid a fatal error in anna - I
assumed that policy ("which version of a package to install ?")
would be enforced somewhere else.
Regards,
JH Chatenet
