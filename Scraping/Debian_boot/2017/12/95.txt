Package: pkgsel
Version: 0.46
Severity: important
Hi,
This commit looks like something that should be been discussed, rather than
something I get to discover while preparing the release announcement:
| commit fdc3d5a6cf5d2af0ca67494321faf4088170362a
| Author: RaphaÃ«l Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>

| 
|     Run updatedb by default when a locate implementation has been installed
|     
|     This can be disabled with the pkgsel/updatedb preseed.
|     
|     This change has been taken from Ubuntu.
Especially with such a description:
| Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
|  If mlocate is installed, update its database after installing packages.
|  This is time-consuming, so you may wish to set this to false to disable it.
If you're concerned about users expecting to be able to run *locate without
waiting for the cron.daily entry, I think it'd be better to have
implementations mention that the DB is empty and how to initialize it
instead.
Currently, locate returns nothing with an empty DB, while mlocate's error
message could be improved:
| locate: can not stat () `/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db': No such file or directory
Also, we seem to have a dlocate implementation too.
I might flip the default to false for the next release, as I don't see why
every user should pay this price for no obvious gain.
Cheers,
