Please don't ship dtb files at all, including the kernel images.
If firmware does not come with hardware description, that is a
shortcoming of the firmware. If a newer kernel cannot be booted with
an existing device tree, then that is a bug and the kernel should be
patched.

Ok, so in your world a distribution should not ship any dtb files, 
because the manufacturer's firmware is bug-free and feature complete on 
day one.
That tree is the sum of the dtb files of the corresponding kernel, which 
this bug report is about. Those may not adhere to your definition of 
verified, but please don't forget that there're two separate worlds out 
there: upstream and downstream. Debian's current way of booting a kernel 
release with its dtb ensures those world never collide, and I think that 
is a very wise choice.
I don't know what devices you work on, but I have a couple of different 
consumer armhf and arm64 devices, spread out over different 
architectures. All their device trees are updated every single kernel 
release. Often it's for new drivers like mmc, pci, net, dri etc., which 
obviously the installer could make use of. Bindings are merged with the 
driver, so of course I want the dtb matching its kernel!
