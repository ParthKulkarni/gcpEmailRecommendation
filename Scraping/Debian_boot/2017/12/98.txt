Hi,
RaphaÃ«l Hertzog enabled unattended-upgrades support by default in pkgsel,
which is first shipped with the D-I Buster Alpha 2 release (#875858).
It would be nice to document this change in the release notes, along with
possible configuration changes users might want to perform, if only how to
opt out in case one doesn't wish to use this feature (I figure removing the
package entirely is the easiest, but it could be pulled through recommends,
so advice on configuration variables might be valuable).
Thanks for considering.
Cheers,
--
