Package: lvm2-udeb
Version: 2:1.02.145-4
Severity: grave
Tags: d-i
Justification: renders package unusable

Hi,
Current netboot buster images have broken LVM support (selecting normal
LVM or encrypted LVM leads to a freeze of the d-i UI) and have had that
since the switch from the 20171114T160649Z to the 20171115T035204Z
dinstall, which contain these updates for amd64 udebs:
  dmsetup-udeb, libdevmapper1.02.1-udeb, lvm2-udeb = from 2:1.02.145-1 to 2:1.02.145-4
which matches the lvm2 source update from 2.02.176-1 to 2.02.176-4.
This is blocking the Buster Alpha 2 release, so an urgent fix would be
appreciated.
Changes like “* Enable udev rules in udeb. (closes: #504341)” might have
been requested years ago, but some kind of heads-up on debian-boot@ about
upcoming changes to lvm support in d-i would really have been appreciated…
KiBi.
