This shouldn't happen, since freetype uses x.y.z as major.minor.patch.
So a release incrementing z should only fix bugs, not alter the API.

Yes, but it is conservative, perhaps. 'dh_makeshlibs -V' then depends on 2.8.1.
Given what we know about freetype's versioning, this doesn't seem necessary IMO.
On another note, I was wondering if using 'cut' is simpler than 'sed'?
$(shell echo "$(ver)" | cut -f-2 -d'.')
Thanks,
Hugh
