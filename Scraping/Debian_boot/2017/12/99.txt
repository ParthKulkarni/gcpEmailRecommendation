The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the second alpha
release of the installer for Debian 10 "Buster".
Important notes for this release of the installer
=================================================
 * The unattended-upgrades package is now installed by default through
   the pkgsel component. The intent is to ensure the automatic
   installation of security upgrades. Feel free to help documenting this
   in the release notes! (#883715)
 * The important issues with the mips64el architecture (mentioned in
   the previous release announcement) seem to have been resolved, and
   installation images are back accordingly.
Improvements in this release
============================
 * busybox:
    - Use a temporary workaround to keep exporting invalid variable
      names (e.g. rescue/enable=true) until a better solution is
      implemented.
    - Enable fgrep, blkdiscard, bzcat, lsssci for the udeb flavour.
 * choose-mirror:
    - Update Mirrors.masterlist
 * debian-installer:
    - Bump Linux kernel ABI from 4.12.0-1 to 4.13.0-1.
    - Add support for building against snapshot.debian.org to help
      debug regressions.
 * debootstrap:
    - Add (Ubuntu) bionic as a symlink to gutsy.
 * espeakup:
    - espeakup-udeb.start: Fix case where card 0 does not have an ID
      or where cards have non-contiguous indexes.
 * finish-install:
    - Handle serial console configuration for systemd.
 * live-install:
    - Make sure localechooser is able to configure locale during the
      installation process.
 * pkgsel:
    - Merge pkgsel/update-policy preseed from Ubuntu to offer the
      installation of unattended-upgrades.
    - Install/enable unattended-upgrades by default (#875858).
    - Optimize update-initramfs calls through a temporary divert.
    - Run updatedb if a "locate" implementation is installed
      (see #883711).
    - Run a final "apt-get clean" call at the very end.
 * s390-tools:
    - Fix path for udevadm (#852572).
 * syslinux:
    - Add support for the ext4 64bit feature (#833057).
 * user-setup:
    - Remove support for kdesudo (dropped from stretch).
    - Stop special-casing of some logins (#875909).
Hardware support changes
========================
 * debian-installer:
    - Add udebs to the hd-media image to help detect ISOs in LVM
      logical volumes (#868852). Note: More components need patches
      to support this feature.
 * flash-kernel:
    - Add machine db entries for: Marvell Armada 8040 DB board,
      Marvell 8040 MACHIATOBin (#878570), SolidRun HummingBoard
      Solo/DualLite, FriendlyArm NanoPi M1 Plus, and Olimex
