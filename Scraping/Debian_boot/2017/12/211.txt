I booted using the install disk and used the rescue option
Trying to install grub again from the mounted drive, it reported this 
error:
grub-install: warning: Attempting to install GRUB to a disk with 
multiple partition labels.  This is not supported yet..
grub-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be 
installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are 
UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..
grub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.
a quick search yielded this:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/666527/install-grub-claims-that-i-have-multiple-partiton-labels-and-that-embedding-is
The first partition was indeed 2048 so I ran the command as suggested:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX seek=1 count=2047
and then grub successfully installed and it all boots correctly
Not sure if that helps...
