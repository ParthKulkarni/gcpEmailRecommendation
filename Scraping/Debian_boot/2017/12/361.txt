I have refreshed patch series once in a while, but never got around to
merging them.

The current idea is to pick (3).

Implementation would look like: selecting what packages to pick from
backports at d-i build time, and implement the appropriate merging from
different Packages files in net-retriever, based on this ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù.
I'll try to get back to this during January, and post updated patch
series/status/etc. once I've done a first pass on it.
Cheers,
