It is limited to updates *within the release you're running*. That is,
it won't change your sources.list, but it will upgrade packages that
you've already got installed.
The largest part of that is "security updates", yes, but there will
sometimes also be non-security updates of high-severity bugs in there
(for an example of such a non-security bug that I worked on a while
back, see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=787398).

It's only meant to be a default that can be changed. If you don't like
it, as an informed user, you can switch it off (and we would encourage
you to do so if you have other ways of keeping your systems up-to-date
and secure).
It's only meant to help those who don't care about manually applying
updates.

Please educate yourself on what Debian allows for stable updates
(answer: very very very little)

Yes, in general. Debian prefers to backport security fixes rather than
upgrading to "the newest version", whatever that is. However, sometimes
that isn't possible (e.g., for webbrowsers), and then we do
(reluctantly) upgrade to more recent upstream versions.
