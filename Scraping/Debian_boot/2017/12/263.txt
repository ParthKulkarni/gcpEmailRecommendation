Yeah, that would look good to me, provided there's nothing added in a
x.y.z version that would make the udeb depend on x.y (in the metadata
section) while it actually depends on a feature introduced in a x.y.z
(on a shared object level).
FWIW dh_makeshlibs supports being called with a -V option. Excerpt of
its manpage:
| If -V is specified with no dependency information, the current upstream
| version of the package is plugged into a dependency that looks like
| "packagename (>= packageversion)". Note that in debhelper compatibility
| levels before v4, the Debian part of the package version number is also
| included. If -V is specified with parameters, the parameters can be
| used to specify the exact dependency information needed (be sure to
| include the package name).
That might be a safer approach?
