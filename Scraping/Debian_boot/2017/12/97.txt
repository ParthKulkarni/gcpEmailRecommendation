Well, I opened this bug report to keep track of a change in default
behaviour, to make sure people reading the release announcement for D-I
Buster Alpha 2 would have a pointer to an actual discussion about this
change; which never happened in the first place. I'm not sure it is to be
considered a complaint or passive aggressive though. That's standard
procedure.
It's been repeated over and over again: developers are supposed to discuss
changes impacting the debian installer on the debian-boot@ mailing list, or
in a bug report. Some contributors have not followed that, repeatedly, and
I've on occasion not be the nicest person in the world as a consequence,
e.g. while dealing with the resulting breakages. Sure, I could have been
more patient, etc.; no, I'm not perfect. But there are two sides to every
story.

Again, the “what do people think?” part should have been the first step.

As explained in my first paragraph, that's not the intent.

[ I'm fine with hearing about your feelings. I'm not sure I can do much
about people not following guidelines in the first place, and then
finding it offensive to see bug reports get opened afterwards to try and
figure out whether to keep such changes enabled. ]

Ah, I hadn't realized how little *locate are depended on, especially by
desktop tasks, thanks. I'm guessing the existence of the preseed setting
is a bit strange then, if users getting those packages did actually ask
for it…
Anyway, let's keep that change as it is.
Cheers,
