Hi,
The recent addition of some templates in a package happened in a rather
uncoordinated way, without following best practices. That triggered some
initial work for translators, trying to catch up with the new strings to
translate; until those issues were spotted and fixed. Then translators
have had to update their translations, meaning wasted efforts.
So here goes the reminder: Best practices regarding l10n/i18n are
documented in the “Internationalization and Localization Guide” which
can be found at [1], and which is the first link on the team's home
wikipage [2].
