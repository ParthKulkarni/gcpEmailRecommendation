Just to make sure, grub is showing up and booting your Linux kernel, but
the initramfs fails to find LVM devices, right?
Please share your installer's syslog (/var/log/installer/syslog in the
installed system). You might find d-i's rescue mode helpful to grab such
files.
It might be worth attaching the contents of your initramfs as well:
  lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img* | sort
