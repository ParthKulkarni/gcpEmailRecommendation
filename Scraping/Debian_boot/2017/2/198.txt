This is frequently reported.....and, as usual, plain wrong. en_DK is a
longstanding locale in glibc that is indeed a tweak and that shouldn't
exist.
By design, locales are meant to represent real use cases, which is why
they're nearly always limited to language/country combinations that
indeed *really* exist.
English has no specific status in Denmark (except by being spoken by
many people....but that's also the case in most countries) and the
fact that a en_DK locale existts is only historical.
For that reason, d-i does not directly support tthe en_DK locale and
does it only exactly as you did, through the expert install. Whichis
logical as nobody would choose such combination in normal installs
This is commonly argued by a few people, from time to time.....and
none of them managed to convince the D-I team to do something
else..:-)
So, well, reassigning and tagging accordingly....
