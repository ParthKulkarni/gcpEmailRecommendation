That seems reasonable.

It *is* odd.  I think the assumption was that normally you carry on
using a simple device node atÂ /dev/ptmx but you can opt-in to using
/dev/pts/ptmx through mount options.

Yes, I think so.  ('newinstance' is always enabled in recent kernel
versions, but must be enabled explicitly for older kernel versions.)

I don't think so.  I don't see why that would happen.
