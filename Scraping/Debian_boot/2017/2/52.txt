Hi,
right after replying to the bug report I decided to re-install, just for 
the fun of it. This obviously deleted the install logs, sorry.
But this time I did not have the microSD card in my internal card reader 
like I usually do (/dev/mmcblk1 from my fdisk output) and the 
installation finished without os-prober getting stuck. So my guess is 
that the SD card may have been the culprit even though it does not 
contain any OS, just a plain ext4 file system (no partition table) that 
has some mp4 files on it.
If you want me to I could re-install once again, with the SD card 
inserted, and check the logs. Let me know if that would be of any use.
Cheers!
