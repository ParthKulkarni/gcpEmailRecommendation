AFAICT from the current manpage, when this option is not specified, WWID
are used instead, so there's no need to keep the [0-9] part in the
check, right? This seems confirmed by my reading of #806900 so I think
I'll push the patch to master right away.

Unfortunately lack of manpower means patches are sometimes not reviewed
or merged for a long time. :(

I'll try and look at the various patches after Mathieu's reply in
#806900. I might even propose them through proposed-updates if the next
RC looks good for multipath support.
