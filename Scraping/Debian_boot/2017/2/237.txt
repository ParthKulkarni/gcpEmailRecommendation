As a default option, each installation &quot;formats&quot; the SWAP partition (if SWAP partitions are used) as far as I understand. This changes the UUID of the SWAP partition(s). In /etc/fstab, the UUID of the SWAP partitions is referenced as a constant. In other existing installations, the old UUID of the SWAP partition (overwritten by the new installation) is no valid or found during boot (systemd timeout).</div>

Don't format swap if you want to keep the UUID.
Of course reusing swap would be a very bad idea if you ever tried to
use suspend to disk.
Personally I don't understand wanting more than one system installed,
since that's the one I use.  What would I use another system for?
Experiments and testing I do in chroots or virtual machines.
