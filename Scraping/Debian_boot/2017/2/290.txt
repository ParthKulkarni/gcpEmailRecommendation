Package: clock-setup
Version: 0.131
Severity: serious
Justification: Policy 10.7.3
Upon installation with current d-i (stretch RC 2), clock-setup produces an
empty /etc/default/rcS with 000 permissions.  This breaks subsequent
upgrades from systemd to sysvinit, unless the user knows how to fix this
manually.  Well, answering 'i' to conffile conflict prompt is not rocket
surgery, but it's not possible when unattended/etc, and such prompts for
conffiles unmodified by the user are considered RC.
Moreover, because of "set -e", clock-setup then fails to process the
remaining of the script, which would set the hwclock.  This failure is not
displayed to the user.
The first part is caused by #854923 in busybox, but even if that bug is
fixed, "set -e" will make the second part fail.
