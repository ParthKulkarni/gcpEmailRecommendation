Hi,
Again, I hope this is the right place to raise the above observation.
I got a bad media or corrupted file message when installing Stretch 
testing onto my IBM R60e notebook. This was when I selected "Print 
Server" at "Choose software to install" process and the image was i386 
DVD iso image generated on Jan 23, 2017. I was able to successfully 
install Stretch when I deselected "Print Server" in the process.
After which I decided to run the Check the Integrity of CD-ROM disk on 
the USB stick I used and found out that it was the file 
texlive_latex_extra_doc_2016.20170123-2_all.deb file that failed the MD5 
sum check. At this point I decided the run the same test on the amd64 
USB stick (also generated on Jan 27, 2017) and encountered the same 
error message.
I deleted the two iso files on my hard disk, reformatted the USB stick 
and  downloaded a fresh copy of both the i386 and amd64 DVD images 
generated on Jan 27 to start afresh again. I encountered the same 
failure on exactly the same file on both disk images.
I then waited for the Feb 13 DVD iso images, downloaded them and checked 
them for integrity before I start a fresh install. I encountered the 
same error message at exactly the same file on both the DVD iso image.
I used jigdo-lite to download all these iso images and there were all good.
Has anyone came across this?
Regards,
Lee
