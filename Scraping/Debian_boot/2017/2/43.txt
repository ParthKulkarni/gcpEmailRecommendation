Yep - at least, the title of the bug shows the command that was blocking
(I waited 5 min or so for it before killing it..)

A couple more data points:
I've used the Stretch RC1 installer without issue on another workstation
with a somewhat similar disk layout - the difference being that it had
only one physical drive (one LVM physical volume on a single crypto_LUKS
device).
I've also installed Jessie on several machines with a very similar
partitioning layout as in this bug report (two drives) without issue.
