Basically the article's statement is wrong.
There is no such thing as explicit itable initialization IO bandwidth
restriction in MB/s. itable initialization rate is controlled by init_itable=N
see: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt
"""
The lazy itable init code will wait n times the
number of milliseconds it took to zero out the
previous block group's inode table.  This
minimizes the impact on the system performance
while file system's inode table is being initialized.
"""
By default init_itable=10, so it use 1/10th bandwidth of the disk.
And if we back to original article this means author used generic
HDD with 160Mb/s sequential write performance.
My patch was fix for bug which was spotted on large disk arrays,
36 in my case. So itable initialization was active all the time
while holding global lock.
