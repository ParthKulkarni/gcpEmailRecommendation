For some reason the necessary modules for USB HID or storage to
work are not detected or installed on Banana Pi. They are present
in the initrd though.
I also tried the "Installing from a USB stick" method (
https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Allwinner#Installing_from_a_USB_stick
), but it also failed due to not being able to mount the USB
stick after the installer started. It also did not recognize an
USB keyboard, but I had a serial console at that point.
Installing stretch to a Banana Pi with the SD-card image
(netboot) and a serial console works, but using a USB keyboard
and HDMI output would be far more convenient.
