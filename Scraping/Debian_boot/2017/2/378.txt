It's rather late in the release cycle to be cleaning up things like
thatâ€¦ but since it's being pulled due to:
  [others] â†’ udev (Priority:important â†’ propcs (Priority:important)
  man-db (Priority:standard) â†’ bsdmainutils
  openssh-client â†’ libedit2
I think we should be able to do that nonetheless. Adding debian-cd@ to
the loop to make sure this wouldn't break image building and stuff we
need to put into various images.
