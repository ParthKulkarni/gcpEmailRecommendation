Package: src:debian-installer
When append an console option like:
      console=ttyS0,115200n8
and close vga by
      vga=off
We can redirect the installer output with serial cable.
So we can see the installer interface with minicom or SecureCRT.
For most keys, it seems works well, while when press
arrow keys "up"/"down"/"left"/"right",
they are recognized as 'ESC' key.
I also test it in PMON2000, it seems not having this problem.
aka arrow keys works well.
