Tried to reproduce on a different PC. Installations with graphical
installer with Wheezy and Jessie DVDs both worked fine, complex keys
were accepted.
Can't easily repeat on the affected PC, AMD M4A89GTD USB3 mainboard.
This mainboard has a PS2 keyboard connector. The keyboard used was a
Cherry USB keyboard with a PS2 adapter. Same problem with a native PS2
Cherry keyboard, switching to the PS2 keyboard did not fix the problem. 
Maybe the issue is dependent on some HW boundary conditions.

Unfortunately not reproducable.
