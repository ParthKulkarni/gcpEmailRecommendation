Package: debian-installer
Version: 20170127_amd64
I have installed Debian test image from 1. Feb 2017:
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/stretch_di_rc2/amd64/iso-cd/debian-stretch-DI-rc2-amd64-netinst.iso
During installation i select Danish / Denmark for my Language/Locale.
However after installation gnome-terminal (GNOME Terminal 3.22.1 Using VTE version 0.46.1 +GNUTLS) refuses to display on screen after install due to incorrect locale settings (trying to start from xterm):
rosted@debian:~$ gnome-terminal
(process:2846): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.
        Using the fallback 'C' locale.
^C
rosted@debian:~$
It hangs until I press Ctrl-C (the ^C). Next I tried to read the locale information - and I got the information:
rosted@debian:~$ locale
locale: Kan ikke sÃ¦tte LC_ALL til forvalgt lokale: Ingen sÃ¥dan fil eller filkatalog
(translation) Can't set LC_ALL to chosen locale: No such file or directory.
LANG=da_DK.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=
LC_CTYPE="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC=en_DK.UTF-8
LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8
LC_COLLATE="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY=en_DK.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGES="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER=en_DK.UTF-8
LC_NAME="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT=en_DK.UTF-8
LC_IDENTIFICATION="da_DK.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
rosted@debian:~$
The suspicion at this point is that the install of some locales are missing.
I tried to install "locales-all 2.24-9" from synaptic package manager.
After that the problem is solved - gnome-terminal starts successfully.
Please check locales installation during installation.
Please advice if more information is needed.
