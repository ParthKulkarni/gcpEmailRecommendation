Hi!
Attached are proposed debdiffs for anna, cdebootstrap and their
dependency libdebian-installer (Bug #856210).
Would the release team be willing to grant unblocks for these?
(It would also require an ACK from the d-i release manager).
In the installer, net-retriever verifies the Release file with SHA256,
but anna only validates the .udeb files with MD5, which was surprising.
The .udeb files are extracted and then their contents may be executed
with full privileges during the install (Bug #856211).
netboot images typically fetch .udeb files over unsecured HTTP.  Other
install media bundles those so they need not be downloaded, but it could
still happen if networking is configured during the install and a
network mirror has newer versions of any required .udeb files.  (Some
.udeb files are retrieved later, after installing the base system).
If not already considered a grave security flaw, it might be during the
lifetime of stretch (-2022?).  Even if fixed in a point release, any
install media created before then would remain vulnerable.
cdebootstrap - not used by the installer, but available in stretch - 
only verifies Release files using MD5 (Bug #856215), which is an
unintended regression since jessie.
The changes to libdebian-installer are ABI-compatible, such that only
reverse-dependencies that use the md5sum field should be affected
(thought to be just anna and cdebootstrap).  They would FTBFS until
patched, and already-built binaries would report a "md5sum mismatch" if
they used this new version of the library at run-time, since the new
SHA256 hashes would not match the MD5 hashes they expect.
unblock libdebian-installer/0.109
unblock anna/1.58
unblock cdebootstrap/0.7.7
Thanks!
