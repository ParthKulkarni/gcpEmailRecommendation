So that was reported as:
  #852431 -- installer broken: multipath-udeb depends on missing libmpathcmd.so.0
and fixed, that's why I'm stealing the bug report for the dm-emc part.

Yeah, that seems to be matching an old bug report in other components:
  https://bugs.debian.org/567014
I think I'll go for removing dm-emc right away; we can add other things
if needed.
