Ok.  I'm then surprised that you have any issue.  I have just tried
this:
â‚¬Â kvm -cdrom debian-stretch-DI-rc2-amd64-netinst.iso -serial pty -m 1G   
char device redirected to /dev/pts/8 (label serial0)
and in another terminal
â‚¬ minicom -D /dev/pts/8
and things work just fine, arrows work as expected, minicom being
configured in VT102 mode.
