We already have several bugs for this behaviour:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694068
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=727740
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=777439
and likely more.
Users installing with a wireless connection do not have network after
first boot, unless a -desktop task pulls in network-manager _and_
network-manager is not blocked by rdnssd.
I can fix the latter by removing the conflicts and changing the hook
again to be a no-op if network-manager is installed. But I think a
proper solution would be to warn the user at the end of the installation
that he will not have network access after boot and offer to write a
complete /e/n/i or forcibly install network-manager .
