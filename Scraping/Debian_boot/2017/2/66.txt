I see you've submitted Korean translation, so you must be qualified to
figure out what works best. :)
I'll update the other bug report (#853921) accordingly, thanks.

I must confess that I'd prefer not adding new packages at this point
(and the release team as well), so if just switching to
DroidSansFallback.ttf is sufficient, I think we'll do that for Stretch,
and we can revisit the topic for improved rendering for Buster.
Thanks for your input!
