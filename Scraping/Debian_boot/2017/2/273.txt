Knowing nothing about multipath, I first read the multipath-tools commit
message as ‚Äú[0-9] ‚Üí [a-z] only when user friendly names are enabled,
[0-9] otherwise‚Äù, which I why I was wondering whether we were losing
support in the non-user friendly names case; but that doesn't seem to be
the case.

Feel free to let me know once you've done so, since I've just uploaded
hw-detect_1.123_source and partman-base_191_source. I suppose what's
been just uploaded could be pushed to jessie, while what you'll be
pushing in a moment would only be for stretch?

I meant it as: thanks to your reply to me in that other bug report, I
know what packages I should be looking at, not as ‚Äúplease do more work
for me‚Äù. Apologies for the confusion.
