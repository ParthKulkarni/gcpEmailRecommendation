Well, I've only been doing d-i releases for a few cycles, but base-installer's
history shows no cdebootstrap-udeb in its Depends, ever; granted, history
starts at this point:

The only reference I see in debian-installer's history is its being added in
post-sarge goals, before being removed again, so it looks to me it would only
be put there by people who are supposed to know what they're doing?
Adding to this my initial comments about anna and net-retriever, I think it
might have made sense to be a little less clickbaity with the whole ‚Äúdebacle‚Äù
title. While there's clearly room for improvements in various components, I'm
not sure the installation process is as broken as you made it to be.
