I'm interested in knowing which partition(s) it was hanging on. Do you
remember? Or can you check your installer's syslog (you'll find it as
/var/log/installer/syslog on the installed system).
Thanks!
(I'll be trying to reproduce this issue with various configurations, but
the more I know about the broken one, the quicker I'll figure it out.
