Has anyone taken a look recently at the wifi portion of the install process?
I have an old HP convertible laptop running with an Intel ProWireless 
2200 wifi chipset.  I tried using a debian live install a few days ago 
on it.  When the install process came to configuring the wifi for the 
installation process, it looped. Specifically, it allowed me to select a 
wifi network, specify encryption, and specify a key.  It then looped to 
selecting a wifi network.
The expected behavior would have been to loop back to the beginning of 
the network configuration stage, confirm the wifi network as operational 
by attempting to pick off a DHCP address from the ethernet port and the 
[configured] wifi, and continue with the install when it connected to 
the wifi network.
