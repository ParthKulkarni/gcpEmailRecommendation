It is quite likely that the bios swaps the device ID of sda and sdb when
you choose to boot sdb, which then means grub would get confused since
it was installed expecting sdb to be the second disk, but when booted
it is suddenly the first disk instead.
I suspect to make it happy would require convincing grub that sdb is in
fact the first hd in the system (In older grub versions one would do
this by changing the device.map file in /boot/grub but I don't recall
if that is still used).
Or you could change the order of the disks in the bios (somehow) before
booting the installer and hopefully sdb would be the first disk then
from grub's point of view.
This is my guess at the problem at least.
