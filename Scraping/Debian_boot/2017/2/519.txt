Just FYI, since it's not clear from
https://wiki.debian.org/InstallerDebacle that you know this, the
installer in fact uses debootstrap rather than cdebootstrap to install
the base system.  AFAIK debootstrap has supported SHA256 since version
1.0.28 in 2011.

Checking both adds only negligible security (look up "multicollisions")
and is a waste of time.
The usual reason to keep support for older hash algorithms is just to
make transitions to newer ones less painful.
