This is great news, thanks for following up.

Looking at the current sid branch of linux.git:
| kibi@armor:~/debian-kernel/linux.git$ git grep CONFIG_DRM_AST
| debian/config/config:# CONFIG_DRM_AST is not set
| debian/config/kernelarch-powerpc/config-arch-64:CONFIG_DRM_AST=m
| debian/config/kernelarch-x86/config:CONFIG_DRM_AST=m
Kernel team, it seems it would make sense to enable this module as well
for arm64?
KiBi.
