I'll wait to see a resolution for this upload, then I'll probably stash
a few changes to the jessie branch since we're going to need translation
updates as well (I've got changes locally already but branching in svnâ€¦).
I've just pushed a mass commit to po/*/install-methods.po for trunk, so
that at least the informalexample part is correct: r70504. It'd be nice
to include this in a further jessie update, but probably only after
what's currently in trunk has been uploaded to unstable (which we should
do at some pointâ€¦).
