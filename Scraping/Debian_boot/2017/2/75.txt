Ah yes, I should have diffed the whole tree looking for deltas. I got a
little too laser focused there.

It's been awhile since I've done those ops by hand, but I have used the
Ubuntu installer and it does to the right thing, so those changes can be
safely included.

Their patch does seem inconsistent with the upstream style (eg: I see

could drop their patch.

In the grand scheme I don't think it matters, but there may be security
implications of which I'm not aware.
Should I work up another patch or would you like to take a pass at
massaging the changes from Ubuntu?
