This one comes from src:brltty, and I suppose it might be needed to add
it to some file under [1] if we want to keep an eye on this package.
 1. svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk/scripts/l10n/l10n-stats/config/
This shouldn't be too much of an issue anyway, since that step should be
automatic and need no input, and only users going back to the menu would
see it?
(Adding debian-accessibility@ to cc for good measure.)
