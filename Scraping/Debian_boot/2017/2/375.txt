Package: tasksel
Version: 3.39
tasksel is currently at Priority: important and thus installed in every
installation, including chroots installed via debootstrap.  It doesn't
seem a useful package to install in chroots though.
It would be nice if d-i would install tasksel (and maybe remove it at
the end of the installation again?) so the priority of the tasksel and
tasksel-data packages could be downgraded.
