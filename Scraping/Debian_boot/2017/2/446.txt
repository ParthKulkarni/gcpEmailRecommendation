I've reworded the patch a little, see attached file.
diskutils/sfdisk.c was rewritten anew in v2.26-rc1 and support for the
old shortcut was dropped when --activate was added again after they
restarted from a fresh main(), with getopts.
Pointers:
 * Switch to basic main(), old code deletion

 * (Re)addition of--activate

Old comments:
    /*
     * Activate: usually one wants to have a single primary partition
     * to be active. OS/2 fdisk makes non-bootable logical partitions
     * active - I don't know what that means to OS/2 Boot Manager.
     *
     * Call: activate /dev/hda 2 5 7       make these partitions active
     *                                     and the remaining ones inactive
     * Or:   sfdisk -A /dev/hda 2 5 7
     *
     * If only a single partition must be active, one may also use the form
     *       sfdisk -A2 /dev/hda
     *
     * With "activate /dev/hda" or "sfdisk -A /dev/hda" the active partitions
     * are listed but not changed. To get zero active partitions, use
     * "activate /dev/hda none" or "sfdisk -A /dev/hda none".
     * Use something like `echo ",,,*" | sfdisk -N2 /dev/hda' to only make
     * /dev/hda2 active, without changing other partitions.
     *
     * A warning will be given if after the change not precisely one primary
     * partition is active.
     *
     * The present syntax was chosen to be (somewhat) compatible with the
     * activate from the LILO package.

Awaiting test results from the reporter before pushing.

Subject: [PATCH] Reverse the order of arguments to sfdisk -A, and switch to
 --activate.
During a massive overhaul in util-linux 2.26, sfdisk -A accidentally
changed meaning to --append. This change was later reverted, but the
parsing was also reworked, and support for shortcuts like "fdisk -A2
/dev/hda" instead of "fdisk -A /dev/hda 2" was dropped.
So switch from -A to --activate for safety, and use the expected
argument order.
Submitted-by: Adam Borowski <kilobyte@angband.pl>
Commit message amended based on some util-linux history digging, and
quotes added to all arguments.
