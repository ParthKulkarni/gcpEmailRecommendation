Comments/Problems:
I normally use FAI to install Debian. In order to prepare a stretch
system for forthcoming upgrades, I installed a stretch instance under
a KVM virtual machine. I used the non-graphical advanced mode.
I did not initially realize that the timezone selection list is a hard
dependence on my location and had to go back to configure the locale.
While everything turned out smooth eventually, I recommend an extra
option in the timezone list which would lead to all available timezones.
This may be especially relevant when installing virtual machines in
remote locations via networking.
The bigger problem came when I got to the tasksel step. By accident
I selected "continue" before I had made my selections and the installer
proceeded to downloading 1500+ packages which I did not intend to install.
I have two suggestions here:
1) The system should ask for extra confirmation just like apt-get does:
"You are about to install 1508 packages, taking 345 megabytes of disk
space. Do you want to continue?"
Remember, we are in "advanced" mode, so the user should know what this 
means.
2) The software installation screen should include an interrupt option, 
at least for the initial time when packages are being downloaded and 
interruption would not result in a half-installed unconfigured system. 
I tried the normal keys (Esc, ctrl-C, ctrl-G) but they were ignored.
It would also be nice (given we are in "advanced" mode) if the lists
of packages behind, eg "standard system utilities" were available for
review before the user commits to the install.
In my situation, I just killed the virtual host and started all over.
The second time around, everything was very smooth and I got a bootable
minimal system (no options selected in tasksel) just fine.
