Thanks for the quick insight into this, Karsten!

Hmmm, interesting! Yes, I had not noticed it is finding the card as
mmcblk1. Checking the kernel boot messages, I see the following
messages:
# dmesg |grep mmc

So... Well, mmcblk1 is mounted at mmc0 (don't know what mmc1 is), but
other than that, I see nothing too suspicious.

I would say this makes sense. Even if I had multiple MMC units in my
system, installing on a MMC card should not clobber a preexisting
U-boot image; an option would be for d-i to install the matching right
flavor of the pre-boot environment for the current Debian release, but
of course, that would not enter in Stretch (if it was deemed desirable
at all)

Yes, I have rebooted the machine several times over from other environments.
