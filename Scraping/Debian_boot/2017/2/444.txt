Indeed, we're very happy with bug reports for successful installations,
thanks! This helps us compare what works and what doesn't, which usually
help pinpoint root causes for some bugs.
Since everything was perfect, I'll do what we do for successful
installation reports: close them. :-)
Thanks again.
KiBi.
