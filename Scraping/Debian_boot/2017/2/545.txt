I just ran across this from Martin's instructions on how to install
Debian on a Jetson TX1 and this sounds familiar. I ran into a similar
bug not long ago that turned out to be caused by e2fsprogs 1.43 which
enables the 64bit (-O 64bit) feature by default. U-Boot (before 2016.07
I think) can't deal with such filesystems and will read bogus data.
Newer versions of U-Boot have support for this. Another solution was to
create filesystems with -O ^64bit to disable the offending option.
Given that the last entry in this bug report is rather old, I'm not sure
this is still an issue, but I thought I'd bring it up in case this still
doesn't work properly.
