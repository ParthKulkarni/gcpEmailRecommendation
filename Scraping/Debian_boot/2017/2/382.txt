The Debian Project is a volunteer run organisation, and as such does not
have a legal existence that might be expected to be the issuer of such
certificates.
Also, this mailing list ('debian-boot') is devoted to the activity of
building the Debian-Installer, so even if it is possible for the Debian
Project to come up with such a certificate, this is not the right place
to ask.

Since The Debian Project is a volunteer organisation (not a company),
we're _all_ here with no salary, and you are welcome to join us. :-)
I suppose you could ask the security team for a note of thanks, or maybe
the publicity team.  Would either of those suffice?
The contact information for the parts of Debian can be found here:

Cheers, Phil.
