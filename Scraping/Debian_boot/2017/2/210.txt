Hi,
I'm using Wayland, and I would like to remove X.Org from my system.
I don't care much really, for my own use case: I can live with the
disk space cost. But once GNOME switches to Wayland by default in
Debian (uninformed guess: in Buster), perhaps we can trim down a bit
the (default) desktop installation images by not including X.Org
in there. Removing xorg, xserver-xorg and the packages automatically
installed because of them saves 8 MB on my system, so granted that's
not much and may not be worth the effort.
I see:
  $ aptitude why xorg
  i   task-gnome-desktop Depends task-desktop
  i A task-desktop       Depends xorg   
What can possibly go wrongâ„¢ if we replaced:
  Depends: tasksel (= 3.39), xorg, xserver-xorg-video-all, xserver-xorg-input-all, desktop-base
with something like:
  Depends: tasksel (= 3.39), xorg | wayland, xserver-xorg-video-all | wayland, xserver-xorg-input-all | wayland, desktop-base
?
FWIW, task-desktop seems to have no reverse-build-deps, so this should
not affect buildds (that don't prefer the first alternative) for
existing packages.
Cheers,
