Eww, we have this code right now already:
| 	# If we need SSL certificates, copy them in now.
| 	if [ "$PROTOCOL" = "https" ] && [ -d /etc/ssl/certs ]; then
| 		if find /etc/ssl/certs/ -name \*.crt | grep -q .; then
| 			mkdir -p /target/usr/local/share/ca-certificates
| 			cp -a /etc/ssl/certs/*.crt /target/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
| 			chroot /target update-ca-certificates || true
| 		fi
| 	fi
â†’ It's likely not getting run with netinst imagesâ€¦
I think I'll file this as another bug report for reference.
