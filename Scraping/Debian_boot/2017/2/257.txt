That makes sense. Maybe it could still output commented-out
configuration into /e/n/i, to make it easier in case people do end up
editing the file to set up their network, for whatever reason.

I think trying to manage this conflict between two basic packages is
asking for trouble. rdnssd doesn't depend on /usr, I think in some
cases it can still be beneficial for bootstrap when network-manager
might not be available. There is already a distro-specific patch for
/etc/rdnssd/merge-hook to add a resolvconf by-pass, another one could
be added checking if network-manager is installed/available/running/in
charge of /etc/resolv.conf. I've never used network-manager personally
so I wouldn't quite know what's best to check exactly.
