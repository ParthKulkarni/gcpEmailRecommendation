I test Debian 9 with debian-testing-amd64-DVD-1.iso.
During "Set up users and passwords" i can set "Root password:" and "Re-enter
password to verify:".
Under each of these inputs there is a check box with "Show Password in Clear".
I don't se why it would be neccesary to have two check boxes with "Show
Password in Clear".
Why not just one?
In what senario would you want to only see one of the passwords in clear and
hide the other one?
Also when you type the first password and hit TAB the focus goes to the first
"Show Password in Clear".
It would be better jo one have one "Show Password in Clear" and have it below
"Re-enter password to verify:".
That way when you press TAB after typing the password the first time the focus
will go to the second input.
Also the same for the screen where you create a new user that is not root.
