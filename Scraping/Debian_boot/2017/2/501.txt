Comments/Problems:
After copying the firmware and installer to the SDcard, I set the
environment and booted the installer in uboot using:
| setenv console tty1
| setenv bootargs console=tty1 fb=false
| boot
The kernel boots, the syslogger starts, I get prompted with the
'Select a language' dialog, but my USB keyboard does not work in d-i (it
did in uboot).
