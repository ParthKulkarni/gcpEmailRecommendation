Switching from the Full to the non-Full variant of this font seems to be
the way to go, at least at the moment, see Changwoo Ryu's reply and mine:

You'll find attached a patch against sid to implement this change. I've
initially worked with your git repository, but I think it's missing at
least a tag for the recent upload.
I'm fine with NMUing your package if that saves you time. Please let me
know what you prefer.
