Hi,
I hope this is the right place to raise the above observation.
I used the Stretch testing dvd image generated Jan 23, 2017 and observed 
that whenever I chose Chinese locales (all Singapore, China and Taiwan 
variants selected) in addition to the main system default locale 
en_SG.UTF-8 (along with all en_US, en_GB and en_SG variants selected), 
the Installer would start in English but first jumped outputing progress 
information in Chinese at and after the subprocess of "Drivers to 
included in the initrd" of "Installation the base system". Eventually 
even the dialogue for the installation process itself were all in Chinese.
When I chose only the English variants for all US, GB and SG and 
selected en_SG.UTF-8 as system default the installation process when 
were all in English.
Has anyone came across this?
Regards,
Lee
