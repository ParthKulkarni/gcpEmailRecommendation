Hi,
	I tried installing RC2 (netboot) on my ASUS TP200SA yesterday and ran
into a similar issue, os-prober hang during the install-grub phase. The
thing here is that I'm neither using LVM nor any crypto, just the plain
eMMC with a couple of partitions (see below).
I could successfully finish the installation by manually killing the
os-prober processes (there were multiple running) and then trying the
GRUB re-install again via the install menu. The second time it worked.
After I finished the installation I decided to try again, restarted a
fresh installation and same thing - os-prober would hang on the first
attempt but finish without any issues after killing and re-trying.
Not sure if this any useful info but I thought I'd mention it b/c I
don't see any reports for plain, non-encrypted, non-LVM disks showing
this issue.
But maybe it's a completely different problem?
FWIW:
