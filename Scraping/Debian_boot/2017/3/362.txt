With all due respect, 99% of the build code for the debian-installer
is yours. As well as the build pulls 99% UDEBs from official debian
repositories.
i.e., this is a Debian issue, not mine -- as I did not even touch that
code and/or modules -- which 1 month ago actually did work smooth:
Netboot debian-installer was unable to load firmware from second USB
for wifi connection;
accordingly, in another virtual screen, I mounted the 2nd USB and
manually copied the firmware
directory onto the installer environment /lib. d-i then detected the
wifi signal, etc.
Second, report on this unofficial jessie-backports kernel
4.9.16-1+reiser4.0.1 sheds light on the fact I experienced *no issue*
with module i915, as had been reported by (maintainer?):
< https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=858078 >
thus, in a collateral manner, I am contributing to official debian development.
Finally, I am not requesting *any* support. I am simply reporting that
your d-i pulling official UDEBs actually have been successful, with
minor modifications and a few extra UDEBs of mine, in my installation
experience, following Debian documentation guidelines:
"We also encourage installation reports to be sent even if the
installation is successful, so that we can get as much information as
possible on the largest number of hardware configurations."
< https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch05s04.html.en#submit-bug >
If you are still 'bothered' with my sporadic submissions, I encourage
you to modify the documentation to specifically exclude the glaring
omission.
Best Professional Regards.
