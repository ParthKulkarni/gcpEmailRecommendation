Subject : Missing virtio modules for sparc64

Hi all,
Recent versions of the debian-installer for sparc64 no longer contain
the virtio-modules included in the kernel used to boot the installer.
This makes it impossible to install Debian directly from a virtio CDROM
device.
Currently I have a set of patches of OpenBIOS (as used by QEMU) to add a
virtio-blk driver which will enable this functionality for both SPARC64
and PPC architectures, with the hope that I will be able to add
virtio-net support at a later date.
Please can you consider the attached patch for inclusion in the
debian-installer so that it becomes possible to perform a complete
sparc64 installation from virtio devices under QEMU?
Note: I also see that there is a related patch for PPC at
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=767487 which hasn't
been applied yet. Is there any chance that this could also be applied in
order to aid with my testing?
Many thanks,
Mark.
