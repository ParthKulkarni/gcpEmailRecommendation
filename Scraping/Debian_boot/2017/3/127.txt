It can if the network card's 'expansion ROM' provides an iSCSI driver
for the system firmware (BIOS/UEFI).

I disagree, as this is not always necessary.  However I don't know how
the installerÂ can tell whether it is necessary.  When an x86 system is
booted from iSCSI, there should be an iBFT (visible under
/sys/firmware/) specifying the configuration that was used.  I don't
know if that is still present when boot-from-iSCSI is supported but was
not used.
