Please go ahead.  There may be some users that set module options at
installation time and don't want them set in the installed system.  But
they are likely to be outnumbered by those who do want them set.  If
the installer can boot with those module options then the installed
system very likely can too.

This is a good point.  Is there a list of things to check during each
release cycle?
