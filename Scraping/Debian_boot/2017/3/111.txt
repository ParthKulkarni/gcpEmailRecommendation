Dear Maintainer,
Please reassign to the relevant package when necessary.
I used the alternative 'expert' installation, happens both remote or
with gui or text only. When the time came to choose my mirror for apt
sources, I could pick between http, ftp and https. With the first two, I
got a nice big mirror list to choose from (or add my own), however, the
https one was empty and I could only add a link of my own. The list on
https://www.debian.org/mirror/list doesn't make it easy for me to filter
out mirrors that offer stretch and are serving over https.
Would it be possible to add a default one or list? I understand that
httpredir is a failed project, so some choices besides the infamous
fastly cdn would be most welcome. Bonus kudos for adding an onion option
as well and preseeding that too ;-)
