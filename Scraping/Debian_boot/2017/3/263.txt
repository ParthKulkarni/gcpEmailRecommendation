I tried to use the daily snapshot of 16th March on an acer Aspire one HAPPY-2DQuu (Model No. PAV70) but after the line
syslinux [...]
I only get an text cursor in the upper left corner and the fan spins wild. I used an USB stick with 
boot.img.gz
and
debian-testing-amd64-netinst.iso.
This stick works on my lenovo ThinkPad E135.
Do you have any idea what happened there?
