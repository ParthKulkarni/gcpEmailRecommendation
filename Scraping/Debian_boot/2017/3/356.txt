If you wanna install Debian Sarge with kernel 2.6 through 
debian-installer on old machine with 32MB memory, debian-installer 
crashed (looping forever).
Debian-installer working well till he ride on "fdisk-udeb" at 87%. Then 
he restarted from the beginning and working till he ride on 
"xfsprogs-udeb" at 8%. Then he restarted from the beginning and working 
till he ride on "xfsprogs-udeb" at 8%. And looping forever from 
beginning to "xfsprogs-udeb" at 8%.
I pushed ALT+F3 and last *.ko module was isofs. I pushed ALT+F4 and 
watching looping, but not so interested i mean.
! If i install Debian Sarge with kernel 2.4 through debian-installer on 
the same machine with 32MB memory, everything working good and 
instalation successful !

Installing Debian on 32MB RAM machines is over for several releases, so
there is no point on this bug report, closing it.
