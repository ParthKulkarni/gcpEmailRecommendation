Hi,
since the Dutch translation currently has chapter 1 - 5 translated now,
I would propose to activate that language in the package for Stretch.
I think it gives enough benefit for Dutch readers now, even if not fully
translated.
(I expect Frans to finish the chapter 6 before the release of Stretch,
which would mean all "important" chapters, 
	Welcome to Debian
	System Requirements / Hardware
	Before Installing Debian GNU/Linux / Preparing
	Obtaining System Installation Media
	Booting the Installation System
	Using the Debian Installer
being translated then.)
What do you think?
Holger
