Well, we could close the bug, but it strikes me that this is still a
bug, since the stick could have saved you the wasted time if it had
detected the lack of RAM and told you that it wasn't going to work, or
failing that we could at least add a note about it to the manual.
Do you happen to know how little RAM was enough for it to work, or how
much you had when it wasn't working?
Cheers, Phil.
P.S. you can close bugs yourself by mailing e.g. 855396-done@bugs.debian.org
