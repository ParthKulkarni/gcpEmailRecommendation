Package: installation-reports
Boot method: CD/DVD
Image version: debian-8.7.1-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso, 
debian-8.7.1-amd64-netinst.iso, debian-8.7.1-amd64-DVD-1.iso
Comments/Problems:        My goal was to install Debian on a portable 
USB hard drive while leaving my Windows hard drive untouched.  Near the 
end of the install, it asks if it can put Grub on the main hard drive: I 
said “no”.  The next screen presents a menu, an example of which is 
shown below.
    I selected the third item in the menu and the install completed 
without apparent errors.
    In order to use this Debian installation, I must invoke the 
computer's Boot Menu as it is started.  I then select the USB hard drive 
as the boot device and press ENTER.  The screen blanks, the USB hard 
drive activity light blinks about 3 times, and the computer is found to 
be unresponsive to everything except the off button.
    I have tried installing with three different Debian versions on two 
different computers with two different USB hard drives.  I have tried 
various partitioning arrangements, but the result is always the same, a 
failure to boot.
    However, I have found that I can get a successful installation by 
doing one thing differently.  When I'm asked if Grub can be put on the 
main hard drive, I still say “no”.  On the next screen I choose the menu 
item “Enter device manually”.  On the next screen I type in “/dev/sdb” 
(from the example shown above).  This small change will give me a 
bootable installation.
    So my question for you is: why would typing in information give a 
different result than selecting that same information from a menu?  If 
this is your desired behavior, then I suggest that additional 
instructions or information would be helpful at this stage.
