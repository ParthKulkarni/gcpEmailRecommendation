Hm, the times of these three are too recent. I can see two possibilities:
  1. either the bug no longer exists in this system, in which case we 
have to find out what caused these files to be created, or
  2. the bug still exists and each time the system boots, it recreates 
these three files.  In this case we have to find out the cause of this.
Can you check if the times of these three files change each time the 
system boots?  And what about the files 
/etc/default/{keyboard,console-setup} -- do their times change too?

These look ok to me.  I was kind of hoping to find something wrong here...

This line creates an empty file /run/console-setup/font-loaded which is 
used by /lib/udev/rules.d/90-console-setup.rules to make sure the script 
/etc/console-setup/cached_setup_terminal.sh is not run before 
/etc/console-setup/cached_setup_font.sh.

These look ok as well...
