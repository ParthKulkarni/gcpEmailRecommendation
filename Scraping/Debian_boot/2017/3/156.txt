Source: busybox
Version: 1:1.22.0-19
Severity: wishlist
The dumpleases utility would be made more useful on a system with an SSD if 
FEATURE_UDHCPD_WRITE_LEASES_EARLY were set at build time, because then you 
wouldn't need to set a low auto_time (udhcpd.conf option) to get up-to-date 
lease information from an unprivileged account, without having to first send 
a signal to udhcpd from root. Please set this build option.
