Hello -boot people,
(Cc debian-doc for information)
I don't know if there will be a d-i Stretch RC 3, but I would like to
complete the "installing" chapter of the release notes.
I have already done some easy update [1]:
* ports: mips64el added and none removed
* i586 bumped to i686
* Graphical installer by default in supported arches
* No new languages
I have seen some important news:
* multiarch default is now amd64
* ifname instead of mac address
* Full CD sets were removed
* Almost all alternative options for CD#1 were removed,
  since the installer gives en easy choice of desktop selection during
  task selection, since Jessie. 
  Only Xfce CD#1 remains as a single-CD desktop system. 
* Produce two beeps when booted with grub instead of one,
  so the user knows he has to use the grub way to edit entries.
* Install MATE desktop by default when brltty or espeakup is used in
  d-i.
* Add HTTPS support
Please comment if I forgot something you think is important, or if I
add something that is not.
Also, I'd like to know if the sentence about UEFI:
"Note that this does not include support for UEFI Secure Boot." is
still valid.
I intend to send the attached patch in the ddp svn next week-end if
nobody complains.
Thanks for your feedback.
Baptiste
