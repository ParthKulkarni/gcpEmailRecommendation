Thanks for weighing in. Phil, let's do that; note: we have a couple of
days at least before Stretch RC 3 but the sooner it gets uploaded, the
better.

There isn't yet (at least that I know of), but there should be. There
are a list codenames in various components (if not only src:d-i), bits
for the website, probably the installation guide etc.
But it would be nice if we could just automate doing so on a regular
fashion, e.g. using some cronjob on dillon (see also detecting missing
git pushes for branches/tags). I'll probably deal with this specific
bit, but documentation could be added to the wiki I suppose. Wiki pages
should probably get a review at some point, too, but that's another
topic.
