Hi,
Recently I have hit into the issue of automatic partition done during the
installation of Debian jessie
creating too small root (/) partition, and tried to find out where to report
this and found the following post which is quoted below.
Sorry I am not sure how to quote a post to debian-boot mail archive, which I
found at
https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2014/10/msg00115.html.
The subject was "root-fs too small [was: Re: Debian Installer Jessie Beta 2
release]".
So I simply copy and paste the web page below.

Does the recent netinstaller for jessie I downloaded last weekend contain
the fix for above?
I doubt it because I just hit the too small root partition issue
after I was upgrading and doing some installation stuff on a new installation.
I think in today's bloated kernel (and other related stuff) world, we should
set aside 20G for root (/)
[maybe much more. I found the suggestion for 32GB which may be a tad too
large, but...] at the minimum during automatic partition.
We probably should warn the user if the installer finds the root partition
too small.
I would rather live with smaller /home partition and larger /root partition.
There was enough space in /home to make /root bigger in my case.
I got bitten with this issue three times on different machines in the past
three years and so decided to the manual partition for a fresh install based
on my experience, but I was in a hurry this time
and tried netinstall with automatic partition and hit into this problem again.
The machine is in limbo because I cannot even remove packages. (I tried
setting TMP, TMPDIR, etc. to point to a non-root partition, but to no avail.)
I will try re-installing this weekend, but I wanted to report the issue to
debian bug system.
Where should I report this?  Since the installation of Debian GNU/Linux
system is NOT in usable state [the partition filled up and many commands
refused to run.],
I cannot send the bug report from THAT machine.
Thank you in advance for your attention.
