https support is rather new, and I'm not sure how choose-mirror deals
with it. The update I was about to upload yesterday failed to build
anyway, so some investigation is in order.

Some quick notes:
 - d-i syncs its mirror list from what's in mirror/mirror-masterlist.git
   so if you're not happy with the list of mirrors present there, submit
   new, non-infamous (whatever that means) mirrors.
 - preseeding is an entirely different concept in d-i:
