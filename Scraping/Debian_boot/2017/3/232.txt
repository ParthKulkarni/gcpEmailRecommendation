As you know, I added your prerequisite patch but I never added this
patch and didn't explain why (apart from hoping someone else would
take ownership).
Basically, it seems to me like an hack to add this specific boot
script when work is going on to support Odroid-C2 properly upstream.
I don't have such a device, but I looked at the u-boot list a few
weeks ago and it seems there has been a lot of progress recently.
So I'm wondering whether this approach makes sense:
* In flash-kernel, add an entry that uses the generic boot script
* Get an u-boot-armlogic (or whatever) package into unstable using 2017.03
* Document the install process on wiki.deban.org, i.e. take the u-boot
  from unstable and then install stable.
What do you think about this approach?  Do you know how well u-boot
2017.03 works on this device?
