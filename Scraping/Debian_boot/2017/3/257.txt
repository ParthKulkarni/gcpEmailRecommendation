It seems that I should have waited for that to completely finish before
firing of the mail ... that run had a race condition in the test.
The test now waits for grub.cfg to exist before looking at it:
  http://78.137.97.249:8080/job/lvc_debian-miniiso/340/console
The interesting bits are the line:
  And I intend to boot with options: wibble.foo=bar fsck.bar=baz
(wibble should be assumed to be a module, whereas fsck should not)
and the lines that start with:
  And running "...
where I'm grepping various files to make sure that they contain what I
expected.
Cheers, Phil.
P.S. You'll note that the "wibble.foo=bar" option is assumed to be a module
and so ends up setting things in /target/etc/modprobe.d/local.conf, but
it also gets into the grub.cfg -- perhaps we should not be letting these
assumed-to-be-module settings through to the installed grub.cfg, but
that's more in-line with the idea of simply dropping the dot filtering,
so seems the least intrusive change for now.
