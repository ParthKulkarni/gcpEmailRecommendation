Hi,
I'm not sure debian-boot is the right place to ask this, so sorry if I'm
making a bit of noise.
On Openpower machines, it would be nice to have opal-prd package
installed at install time because it provides opal-prd daemon which load
and run the OpenPower  firmware's Processor Recovery Diagnostics binary.
This is responsible for runtime maintenance of Power hardware.
The criteria is the existence of the directory
/sys/firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,opal/diagnostics 
I already asked about it for Ubuntu :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/skiboot/+bug/1555904/comments/6
but I'm not sure this enablement will be done in the same place on both
distros.
What would be the best place to implement this check and then add
opal-prd in the list of packages to install.
Thanks for any tips,
F.
