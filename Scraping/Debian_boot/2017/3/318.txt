There might be a third possibility which seems to happen on one of my
systems: the cached_setup_font.sh script does not work correctly when
run during boot by udev.  Because this is what I am observing here, I
even added some debug messages to it to see if it is run at all (as
intended by /lib/udev/rules.d/90-console-setup.rules), and indeed it
does run but the font still remains unchanged.
Manually running /etc/console-setup/cached_setup_font.sh (or
setupcon -f, for that matter) works fine, so I'm a bit at a loss here.
Cheers,
