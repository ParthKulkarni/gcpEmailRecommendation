Well, a quick grep of the d-i source reveals that we mention rcS in:
  clock-setup/finish-install.d/10clock-setup
and
  flash-kernel/debian/flash-kernel-installer.postinst.in
and that in both cases, each mention is guarded by first checking for
the existence of the file.
My next guess would be that some postinst of another package that was
installed is doing it.  However, looking at sources.debian.net didn't
show that up -- I might have missed it, or the thing doing it might not
contain the full path, say.
BTW Is this reproducible?
Cheers, Phil.
