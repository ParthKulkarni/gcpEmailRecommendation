Package: installation-reports
Severity: serious
Justification: ?
Dear Maintainer,
   * What led up to the situation?
	installing Debian 8.6 from the netinstall disk and confiuring LVM with encrypted root, swap and var logical volumes. Then, reboot as soon as the system has booted for the first time.
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
	I've tried re-installing the system several times, deleting all of the partitions and setting everything up again from scratch. The same problem applies if you reboot immediately after booting the system for the first time.
   * What was the outcome of this action?
	the system boots the first time, and you are prompted for the swap logical volume password. Then, without making any changes, if you reboot, the system hangs with an "a start job is running" message, referring to swap. When this times out, the system boots, but with no swap disk.
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
	for the system to boot with an encrypted swap, as with Debian 7 (which I've tried on the same system, sucessfully).
