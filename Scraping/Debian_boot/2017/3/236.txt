Hello.
I've trying to get rid of task-english in my preseeded installation. At 
first i select none option for tasksel (tasksel tasksel/first 
multiselect none). However, tasksel install task-english anyway. I've 
searched these options to skip language support installation:
But it doesn't work. So what's the right way to avoid task-english 
installation?
