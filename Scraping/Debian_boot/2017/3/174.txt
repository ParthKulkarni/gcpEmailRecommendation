That's a very reasonable request and I am pretty sure there is no problem merging
your patch into the debian-installer repository. One of our sparc64 users requested
the same change for that architecture as well.

There will most likely images available in the near future. Debian Developer James
Clarke has improved support in debian-installer for Ports architectures and the
next upload should actually build fine on most of these architectures, including
ppc64.
I suggest sending your patch to the debian-boot mailing list. From my experience,
trivial patches like this one usually get merged quickly. I assume it was just
overlooked.
Thanks,
Adrian
