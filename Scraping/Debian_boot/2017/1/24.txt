Hi Philipp,
Thank you for the clarification, and sorry for my tardy reply.

Oh, there!  I had already checked that out in
debian-installer/packages/rescue.  :-) From what I gather, DTRT looks
something like one of the following:
1. Use existing choose partition menu
  * select partition menu
  * test if selected partition is a btrfs volume
    -  if there are no subvolumes, use present behaviour
  * if subvolumes exist
    - install btrfs-progs udeb
    - use btrfs subvol list to read subvols
    - present a menu
How is this currently handled for LVM?  There is very little code in
"rescue" itself, and I haven't yet managed to figure out how
everything fits together.
2. Alternatively, duplicate the existing LVM code, then modify it for
   btrfs.
If you could point me to whatever 'rescue' ties into for LVM support I
would be very grateful!  From what I've gathered so far, "rescue"
dependency on the btrfs application is provided by the btrfs-progs udeb and
not through initramfs
Cheers,
Nicholas
