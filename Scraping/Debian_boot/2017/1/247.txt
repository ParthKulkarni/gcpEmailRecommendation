os-prober assumes that there is no space around '=' sign for append 
directive in yaboot.conf, while there can be. Therefore, both 
append="some options" and append = "some options" are valid in 
yaboot.conf. This patch fixes this parsing bug.

Description:

 os-prober-udeb - utility to detect other OSes on a set of drives (udeb)
Closes: 648208 674561 698598 698733 701814 776275 784709 787418 794409 801631 803155
Changes:
 os-prober (1.72) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * Improve logging of mounting and setting partitions to ro/rw (thanks, Ivo
     De Decker).
   * Use a read-only device-mapper entry if possible rather than setting the
     underlying device to read-only (thanks, Ivo De Decker; closes: #701814).
     Note that this introduces a dependency on dmsetup on Linux
     architectures.
   * Remove the "blockdev --setro" code path entirely, since the read-only
     device-mapper arrangement supersedes it and should be safer (closes:
     #648208).
   * Make os-prober-udeb depend on grub-mount-udeb on all Linux and kFreeBSD
     architectures, now that it's available on them all (thanks, James
     Cowgill; closes: #776275).
   * Make os-prober depend on grub-common on Linux and kFreeBSD, in order
     that grub-mount is consistently available.
   * Fix detection of /usr/ partition as a GNU/Linux root partition when
     /lib* directories are moved to /usr/ completely (thanks, Hedayat
     Vatankhah; closes: #698733).
   * Make the yaboot parser more tolerant about the syntax of "append"
     options (thanks, Hedayat Vatankhah; closes: #674561).
   * Disable debugging if OS_PROBER_DISABLE_DEBUG is set (thanks, Hedayat
     Vatankhah; closes: #698598).
   * Replace basename/dirname with shell string processing (thanks, Hedayat
     Vatankhah; part of #694668).
   * Call dmraid only once (thanks, Jeff Mahoney).
   * Fix typos in README (thanks, Nyav; closes: #803155).
   * Add os-release support (based loosely on a patch by Török Edwin; closes:
     #794409).
   * Add Devuan detection (thanks, David Hare; closes: #801631).
   * Work harder to avoid trying to mount extended partitions (thanks,
     Philippe Coval; closes: #784709).
   * Drop " (loader)" suffixes on Microsoft operating systems (thanks, Chris
     Lamb; closes: #787418).
