Package: partman-base
Version: 189
Severity: normal
Hello,
The typical scenario is this: a new computer with pre-installed windows
which we do want to keep as such (and thus guided partitioning using the
whole disk is a no-go), and install Debian in an LVM or encrypted LVM.
The way I would do it is: first go to the manual menu, set up an LVM
volume group, or setup up an encrypted volume and set up an LVM volume
group, and then select guided partitioning to let d-i partition the
available volume.  This is how it works with RAID, for instance.  But
while in the RAID case, the md volume shows up in the list of disks, in
the LVM case the volume group does not show up.
More precisely, for instance:
create example disk with existing partition:
- dd < /dev/zero > disk bs=1M count=1 seek=10000
- /sbin/fdisk disk
  n
  p
  2048
  +1G
  t
  c
then boot the installer and at partitioning step:
- Manual
- Configure the Logical Volume Manager
- Create volume group with the free space on the disk
  (do *not* create logical volumes since the idea is that it's guided
  partitioning which does it).
- Finish
- Guided partitioning
- Guided - use entire disk
- the presented list only shows SCSI1, while it should also list the LVM
  volume group
The LVM+crypt scenario is a matter of inserting this between "Manual"
and "Configure the Logical Volume Manager":
- Configure encrypted volumes
- Create encrypted volumes
- Use the free space on the disk
- Finish
and using the encrypted volume.
For an instance of the RAID case where things do work as expected, with
two physical disks:
- Manual
- Create empty partition tables on both disks
- Configure software RAID
- Create MD device
- RAID1
- 2 active devices
- 0 space device
- select both disks
- Finish
- Guided partitioning
- Guided - use entire disk
- There we can select RAID1
