Package: debian-installer
Version: stretch RC1
Severity: normal

Hi,
I am trying to reinstall a Debian machine which had an older version of
Debian on it, but now I want a slightly different partitioning scheme
for Stretch. The Debian installer offers me to delete the RAID
partitions, but then it continues to force me to have them and does not
allow me to make any changes to it. I already nuked the front part of
the disk with dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1G count=1, and the same
for sdb, but the RAID still persists (should then be mdadm 0.9, because
that's at the end of the disk). It would be great if you could include
code to reliably kill pre-existing RAID partitions.
TIA!
Cheers,
--Toni++
