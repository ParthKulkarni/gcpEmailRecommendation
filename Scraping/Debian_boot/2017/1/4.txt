Package: preseed
Version: 1.76
Severity: normal
Hi,
Noticed this issue in the lintian archive wide processing (runs stable
w. -backports):
"""
N: Processing source package preseed (version 1.76, arch source) ...
[...]
ERROR: xgettext failed to generate PO template file because there is non-ASCII
       string marked for translation. Please make sure that all strings marked
       for translation are in uniform encoding (say UTF-8), then ESC[1m*prepend*ESC[0m the
       following line to POTFILES.in and rerun intltool-update:
           [encoding: UTF-8]
command failed with error code 1 at /srv/lintian.debian.org/lintian/checks/po-debconf.pm line 192.
internal error: cannot run po-debconf check on package source:preseed/1.76
warning: skipping check of source:preseed/1.76
"""
Note due to this error, the lintian report for preseed is currently
incomplete.
Thanks,
~Niels
