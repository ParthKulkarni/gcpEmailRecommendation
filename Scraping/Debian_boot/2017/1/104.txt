Package: keyboard-configuration
Version: 1.156
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***
   * What led up to the situation?
Update of either keyboard-configuration or console-setup causes the problem ONLY in the running Linux session. Is gone after reboot or possibly restart of the service.
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
Happens only in running Linux session where the update of the package took place.
   * What was the outcome of this action?
As an example. In Firefox I often use ALT-Cursor-Left to navigate to the previous page. But right after an update of keyboard-configuration or console-setup this shortcut switches back one TTY (here from 2 where X with Gnome runs to 1 where is a login prompt).
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
Not switching consoles.
Btw. this is the third or fourth time that this happens just after keyboard-configuration or console-setup were updated and I didn't reboot betwen. Because it happens in X I suspect keyboard-configuration rather than console-setup. But I'm only guessing here.
