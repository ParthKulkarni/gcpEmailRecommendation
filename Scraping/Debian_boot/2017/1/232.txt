Comments/Problems:
I downloaded debian-8.7.1-amd64-CD-1.iso and made an UEFI bootable USB Flash Drive (UFD) via RUFUS 2.11. I booted from UFD and chose "Install" (Result is the same if I choose "Install graphical"). The next screen appeared in color stripes like a rug. I tried to change any available video options in GRUB, editting the command line with 'E'. It didn't help. I tried to switch off the discrete video controller (AMD Radeon HD 7500/7600 series) from UEFI BIOS and install with Intel HD 4000. It didn't help. I have had the same issue with previous versions of Debian too. With Ubuntu I haven't had that problem, but I want a classic Debian. I tried to install it on HP EliteDesk 705 G1 booting from the same UFD with the same boot method. The installation was successfull.20170119_152531.jpg20170119_152625.jpg
