Package: partman-md
Version: 77
Severity: wishlist
Hello,
partman-md doesn't warn when disks to be used for RAID are partitioned
with GPT without a bios boot partition for embedding (and I haven't seen
documentation about the issue in the installer manual).
To reproduce:
dd < /dev/zero > disk1 bs=1M count=1 seek=3000
/sbin/fdisk disk1
g
w
dd < /dev/zero > disk2 bs=1M count=1 seek=3000
/sbin/fdisk disk2
g
w
kvm -drive file=disk1 -drive file=disk2 -m 1G -cdrom debian-stretch-DI-rc1-amd64-netinst.iso -boot d
at partitioning step:
- request manual partitioning
- configure software RAID
- keep current partition layout
- create MD device, e.g. RAID1, with the two disks
- write the changes
- finish RAID menu
- set up / partition on the MD device
- install Debian with default options
- let it install grub on sda
This brings an error. syslog shows:
this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition: embedding won't be possible
grub-install: error:
embedding is not possible, but this is required for RAID and LVM install
That's a bit late for noticing thig. Perhaps this should just be
documented in the manual, but the installer could also warn e.g. at the
"keep current partition layout" stage above that there is no device
which has some place to embed boot (but let the user discard it in case
that's on purpose).
