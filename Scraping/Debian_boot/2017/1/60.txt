It should be evident to you, that the device has VIA-graphics and so in fact
openchrome-driver should be workable on it.
Indeed none of my thin-clients with VIA-graphics currently works with Debian and
openchrome, but this particular mobile thin-client is a special case, because of the term
'mobile'. It means, that is resembles a notebook, and thus the openchrome-driver needs to
use the LVDS digital output, which is connected to the integrated LCD-screen.
The other VIA-thin-clients work fine as nano-servers, graphic-output is dispensable, but
neoware m100 should probably be used as a mobile-thin-client, because it has an integrated
LCD-screen. 
Unfortunately the memory of the device is not really upgradable, because one memory-socket
is missing, and the other is connected only half-ways, one-sided. On top of this
limitation, the device lacks USB2-ports, so it is badly, badly below standard, and using
it is not really fun, except if you have some retro-computing interests maybe.
To put it at simple terms: I will happily test the Debian-package of openchrome-driver on
the device, as they come in, but compiling the driver source-code myself is clearly out
of my scope in the context. I would love to help with VIA-driver development,
but currently, I have other higher prioritized things to do, which promise better
effectiveness and more overall-impact, so I feel investing my time there just makes more
sense and is going to yield more useful, meaningful and relevant results.
Cheers!
