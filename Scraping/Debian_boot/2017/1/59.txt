Hi Andreas,
The issue you are having probably is outside of OpenChrome's control.
There appears to be an issue finding the correct library, and I am not really familiar dealing with this kind of a situation.
I guess this is called the dependencies issue, I suppose.
I almost exclusively use Xubuntu / Lubuntu LTS versions for development and validation, and obviously, I am able to compile and load OpenChrome without issues.
To "prove" that Neoware m100 mobile thin client's hardware is compatible with OpenChrome, you may want to download, compile, and install the latest OpenChrome code.
This post I made while back is very detailed, so you should not have issues installing the latest OpenChrome code.
