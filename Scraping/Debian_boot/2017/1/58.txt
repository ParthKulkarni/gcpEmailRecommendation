There is some improvement visible regarding openchrome video-diver, particularly, there
is no xorg.conf necessary any more in order to make use of the VESA-driver, but obviously
X falls back to VESA automatically, which is positive in my opinion, so people will have
some workable graphics-output, even if openchrome-video-driver is not workable properly on
their hardware, without fiddling with Xorg-configuration.
See attached logfile [Xorg.0.log]
As far as I can tell, this is the essential part of the log, showing, why openchrome is
not workable yet:

It would be even nicer, guys, if openchrome worked properly on my hardware instead of
falling back to VESA. Now this would really be super-great, get it?
