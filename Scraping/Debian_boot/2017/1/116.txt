The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the first release
candidate of the installer for Debian 9 "Stretch".
Important changes in this release of the installer
==================================================
 * The switch to merged-/usr as the default setting for debootstrap
   was reverted since it uncovered a number of important issues which
   might not be all fixed in time for stretch. This setting is
   expected to come back as the default at the beginning of the next
   release cycle.
 * As noted in the Stretch Alpha 6 release announcement, Debian Pure
   Blends appeared in the Software selection screen. Unfortunately,
   concerns voiced back then weren't worked on until after the freeze
   started, and a freeze isn't the time where critical screens should
   be revamped. Support was disabled accordingly.
