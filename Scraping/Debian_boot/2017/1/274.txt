This is great news! I was thinking about gtk2 vs. gtk3 just a few days
ago (a cron told me libgtk-3-0-udeb was installable again), and was a
bit annoyed with our recurring inability to move towards gtk3 without
the GL thing fixed (indeed, pulling libgl in d-i seemed a bit heavyâ€¦;
and there were quite a bunch of unmet dependencies in the past; patches
have existed for cdebconf + gtk3 for quite a while).
Maybe we'll be able to handle this at the beginning of the stretch
release cycle. :)
