Indeed, I haven't done any test, but looking at the code, it shows that
the changes assume that libresolv.so.2 and libnss_dns.so.2 stay in sync.

Indeed this has been done to avoid crashes when libc6-udeb is
re-installed at the beginning if the installer process, often causing
crashes in case of version mismatch (because the libnss* libraries were
in a different package).
Now libc6-udeb is unpacked while building the image, but given we still
have half a dozen of libraries without the corresponding udeb,
mklibs copy them on the image, as well as the dependencies, which
presumably includes libresolv.so.2.

The long term solution is to package all the libraries into udeb
packages. That way we can simply get rid of the mklibs pass.
The workaround are to make sure the chroots are up-to-date (which should
be the case now on the build daemons). An other alternative would be to
avoid copying a library in mklibs if it is already present in the image.
That might break if some very strict dependencies are used, though
I guess the way the udebs are downloaded, they should always have the
same or a newer version than in the chroot.
