Well, in the case of busybox as used in d-i, sync seems to ignore its
parameters.  The udeb busybox does so silently, whereas the normally
packaged version of busybox gives the more verbose:
  % busybox sync -f /tmp
  sync: ignoring all arguments
so, in that case it seems harmless ... but also useless ;-)
Is there really any significant amount of work being done by sync here
that is not going to involve to $TARGET? (or other partitions mounted
below target, which we probably also want to sync at this point).
Cheers, Phil.
