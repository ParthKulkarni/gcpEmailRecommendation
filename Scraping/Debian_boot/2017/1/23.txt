rescue-mode is in [0]. That presents you with a menu where you can
select local root filesystems. That should somehow DTRT instead of
mounting the top-level btrfs filesystem with the root filesystem being
below. I suppose it'd be also ok to mount it as-is, as long as the shell
is spawned in the right place. (Although that might be surprising.)
The mode is triggered by passing "rescue/enable=true" on the kernel
command-line. d-i ships with boot menu items that do this.
Kind regards
