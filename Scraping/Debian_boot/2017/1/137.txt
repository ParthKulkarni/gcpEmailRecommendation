I resumed tracking of pending changes in git for D-I packages, after
the release of RC1.
I'll upload kernel-wedge that has a tricial fix to a manpage.
The only other pending change is the following in netcfg:
bubulle@kheops:~/src/debian/debian-installer/trunk/packages/netcfg(master) $ git show 8cd816f384ac3066e5aa2652cb399cd814e98f2c

I tend to be confident in Samuel's changes, but as we are in the
release freeze, we should also be as conservative as we can wrt D-I
changes.
Other advices? Should I build/upload or not?
