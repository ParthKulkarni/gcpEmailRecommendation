I suspect it might be a case of using gpt when not running in UEFI mode
is not normally done.
Normally people are either running UEFI mode and hence use GPT, or
they are using legacy BIOS and hence stick to DOS MBR partition table.
Given you don't have to go to GPT until your disk is 2TB or larger,
it has been OK for most people on legacy systems.
Of course since lilo is also a boot loader option in the installer,
one could argue whether there ought to be grub specific checks in the
partitioning tool.  I believe the warning you saw only came when the
grub install part did its checks much later, which is of course when
the grub code would be run.  Yes that's certainly a bit late given you
have to go back and do it all again if you want to use grub.
