# dpkg -i keyboard-configuration_1.158_all.deb 
(Reading database ... 297104 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack keyboard-configuration_1.158_all.deb ...
update-rc.d: warning /etc/init.d/keyboard-setup still exist. Terminating
dpkg: error processing archive keyboard-configuration_1.158_all.deb (--install):
 subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
 keyboard-configuration_1.158_all.deb
I could force this by manually removing the file, but an earlier
version of keyboard-configuration created the file, and the later
version should cope with it.
The bug is that update-rc.d expects the script to have been deleted,
and will fail if not.  But the preinst script only removes the files
*after* running update-rc.d:
#!/bin/sh
set -e
if [ -x "/etc/init.d/keyboard-setup" ]; then
    update-rc.d keyboard-setup remove >/dev/null
fi
if [ -x "/etc/init.d/console-setup" ]; then
    update-rc.d console-setup remove >/dev/null
fi
dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile /etc/init.d/keyboard-setup 1.138~ -- "$@"
dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile /etc/init.d/console-setup 1.138~ -- "$@"
Either add -f to the update-rc.d invocation, or try something more like:
#!/bin/sh
set -e
for file in keyboard-setup console-setup; do
    if [ -x /etc/init.d/$file ]; then
	dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile /etc/init.d/$file 1.138~ -- "$@"
	update-rc.d $file remove >/dev/null
    fi
done
