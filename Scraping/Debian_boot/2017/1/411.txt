hmm.... From what little I understand, it always the slowest interface
that needs to be supported.
And IIUC , in ext4lazyinit's case it is probably some of the MMC cards
due to which the 16 MB/S transmission is kept - although some of them
are at 104 MB/S as well.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#Table
Whereas USB are at -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.1
USB 2.0 - 35 MB/S
USB 3.0 - 400 MB/S
USB 3.1 - Gen 1 - 400 MB/S
USB 3.2 - Gen 2 - 1280 MB/S
For HDD -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA
SATA 1 - starts at 150 MB/S
Another query - if instead ext4lazyinit IF -
mkfs.ext4 -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0 /dev/mapper/fc-root
is applied then would it would start formatting and making inodes at a
much faster rate - i.e. slowest between the USB Drive and HDD in a
typical workstation - which probably would be a jump 3-4 times the
speed that ext4lazyinit would employ.
WDYT ?
If yes, how as a user could I apply/use the above command while using
debian-installer ?
