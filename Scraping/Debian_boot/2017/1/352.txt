Please find attached a patch that's the minimum necessary to preseed away
the disk erase choice. While you could argue that it could be a full-blown
prompt, it is still possible to cancel the erase during interactive
installations as instructed by the wipe process by hitting [Cancel].
As the wiping occurs directly after selecting the encrypted LVM receipe
I think that should be fine for now.
Optimally this would also be made conditional on the fact if the device
is rotational or not, to avoid the expensive wiping step on SSDs. Note
that Ubuntu already defaults to skip the wipe in this case, although
without a way to preseed otherwise.
The patch does not introduce a translatable string, so I'd be hopeful
that we could still merge this for stretch. I tested the possible paths
through this in qemu and the patch only triggers if the option is
explicitly set to false.
Kind regards
