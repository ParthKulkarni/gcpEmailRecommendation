Package: installation-guide-amd64
Severity: wishlist
Hi,
there are some problems installing on laptops with broken EFI that can be
worked around by installing the EFI boot loader into a special area.
The installer has support for this in advanced or rescue mode, and I think
this should be documented for users that experience problems.
Related bug reports are #737719 and #708430.
