No. The image boot.img.gz has the table of partitions not as at the hard
drive. Partition mount without number (mount /dev/sdc /mnt/usb-boot)  
S5000PAL BIOS, USB Storage Emulation:
[Auto] - USB devices less than 530MB will be emulated as floppy.
[Forced FDD] - HDD formatted drive will be emulated as FDD (e.g.
ZIP drive).
I use "Forced FDD" and USB selected in BIOS Boot Manager
https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/apas02.html.en
"Some BIOSes can boot USB storage directly, and some cannot. You may
need to configure your BIOS to boot from a “removable drive” or even a
“USB-ZIP” to get it to boot from the USB device. For helpful hints and
details, see Section 5.1.5, “Booting from USB Memory Stick”. "
zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sdc 
Jessie boot correctly. 
Stretch boot correctly with boot.img.gz version 20160106
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/20160106/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz
Version from 20170112 print message "Boot error"
http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz
Maybe BUG?
