Hi,
if I add break=top as kernel parameter, I come instantly to the busybox
prompt.
If I add break=modules it takes 90 seconds.
I think it has something to do with the networkdriver igb.
After a break=top, I use modeprobe igb to load it.
Then I use ifconfig -a to show the interfaces:
eth0 eth1 and lo are available.
But no link at eth0 (cable is connected)
Then after ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.111 still no link.
I start a ping and it takes 10 seconds until the link led comes active
and the ping works.
But I told you that a dist-upgrade from 8.7 to 9.0 worked.
I also copied the initrd from this working version to the clean 9.0
installation, but still 90 seconds to boot.
I have no explanation for that (why it works on the upgraded 9.0).
Best regards,
Bernd
