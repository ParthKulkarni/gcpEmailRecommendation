Package: release.debian.org
Severity: normal
User: release.debian.org@packages.debian.org
Usertags: unblock
X-Debbugs-Cc: debian-boot@lists.debian.org, simple-cdd-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
Please unblock package simple-cdd
The source package simple-cdd appears to be blocked due to the
simple-cdd-profiles udeb. This udeb is not used by debian-installer by
default, and the udeb hasn't changed at all since the version
currently in testing.
The new version fixes an issue in boolean handling treating any
specified value, including "false", as if it were True. It also fixes
a compatibility issue with newer versions of debian-cd. And also
supports the BOOT_TIMEOUT variable for generated CD images that use
grub2.
Thanks!
debdiff attached.
