deb.debian.org is a DNS entry to CDN servers.
Long version: wget -qO - http://deb.debian.org | html2text
****** Welcome to deb.debian.org! ******
This is deb.debian.org. This service provides mirrors for the following Debian
archive repositories:
    * /debian/
    * /debian-debug/
    * /debian-ports/
    * /debian-security/
The server deb.debian.org does not have packages itself, but the name has SRV
records in DNS that let apt in stretch and later find places.
To use it with a sufficiently recent apt, you for instance can put
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian unstable main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-debug unstable-debug main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-ports unstable main
in your sources.list.
As of October 2016 the SRV record is
_http._tcp.deb.debian.org.	IN	SRV	10 1 80 prod.debian.map.fastly.net.
_http._tcp.deb.debian.org.	IN	SRV	10 1 80 dpvctowv9b08b.cloudfront.net.
If you hit the server behind deb.debian.org directly, either because you use an
older apt or because you use a HTTP proxy that does not support SRV records,
your requests will get HTTP redirected to one of the CDN instances. If you want
to avoid the redirects, you can pick one instance directly. For instance, this
also works in your sources.list:
deb http://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian stable main
deb http://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian-security stable/updates main
The redirection service is also available on HTTPS, so with the apt-transport-
https package installed, you can use:
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian stable main
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security stable/updates main
This service is sponsored by Fastly and Amazon_CloudFront.
