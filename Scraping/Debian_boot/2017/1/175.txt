I use the server on S5000PAL. For remote reinstallation of system to me
it is necessary to choose in BIOS for USB disks the Force FDD mode. It
will allow to consider USB the separate device and allows to choose him
at single loadings on this version of BIOS.
I use a loading image
stretch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz.
The image is copied on usb a disk through dd. The section 1Gb turns
out. 
When loading with USB the message of "Boot error" is given at once
I have tried to zapusat releases of boot.img.gz for the previous dates
and only the release from 20160106 was loaded without problems. 
The image of hd-media of the jessie distribution kit is loaded without
problems. 
BIOS servers it is updated to the latest version. 
Use of USB on this server works in the HDD mode, but demands
indications of an order of loading in the list of HDD devices. And to
use USB for single loading it is impossible.
