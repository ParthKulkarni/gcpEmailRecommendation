Package: os-prober
Version: 1.73
Severity: important
While purging an old kernel from my stretch machine today I saw a lot of
errors being output at the end when the Grub config was being updated:
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found background image: /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-grub.png
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-1-amd64
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-4.9.0-1-amd64
device-mapper: remove ioctl on osprober-linux-sda2 failed: Device or resource busy
Command failed
  WARNING: Not using lvmetad because duplicate PVs were found.
  WARNING: Use multipath or vgimportclone to resolve duplicate PVs?
  WARNING: After duplicates are resolved, run "pvscan --cache" to enable lvmetad.
  WARNING: PV cU7LfS-Hy15-lqhf-BBlB-b6HB-mxuG-Cij5Pu on /dev/mapper/osprober-linux-sda2 was already found on /dev/sda2.
  WARNING: PV cU7LfS-Hy15-lqhf-BBlB-b6HB-mxuG-Cij5Pu prefers device /dev/sda2 because device is used by LV.
(Warnings repeated many times)
lvm continued to be unhappy after the "apt purge" had finished until I
did a "dmsetup remove osprober-linux-sda2".
