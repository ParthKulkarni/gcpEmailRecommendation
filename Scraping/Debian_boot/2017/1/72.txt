Hi Andreas,
I am not sure of your intention when you changed the title of the technical support request to "How to say No!! in a polite though ridiculous way," but please understand that I do not get paid to work on developing OpenChrome.
I am not a paid developer of VIA Technologies, thin client vendors, or Linux vendors like RedHat, Canonical, etc.
I do not mind becoming a paid developer, although I will rather not want to do it as a contractor.
I work on this out of my own time, and I have spent my own funds (probably around $500 already) collecting VIA Technologies silicon products specifically for validation of OpenChrome code changes I have made.
I have already spent 1.5 years on developing OpenChrome, and if it was not for me, nobody would have done maintenance / further development of OpenChrome past the buggy Version 0.3.3 release.
    Please understand that developers often do not like being forced to adopt end user's particular OS release.
For now, I stick to Xubuntu / Lubuntu based OSes, and this is because I am most familiar with those OSes.
I do maintain source code backward compatibility all the way to X.Org Server 1.7 / Linux 2.6.32.
I do try to make sure that OpenChrome works with OSes other than Ubuntu based OSes, but the primary validation is done on Ubuntu based OSes since that's what I am most familiar with.
    Although I have done so for 2 to 3 months, I have tested OpenChrome Version 0.5 with Lubuntu 12.04 on Wyse Vx0 thin client.
This contains P4M800 Pro chipset; the same chipset your Neoware mobile thin client has.
Someone who owns several VIA Technologies based silicon products taught me how to install Lubuntu 12.04 on a USB flash memory stick that is recognized as a USB hard drive.
This is now I verified that OpenChrome works with Wyse Vx0 thin client.
Just to prove that OpenChrome works with your Neoware m100 mobile thin client, I recommend that you obtain a USB flash memory stick that can be recognized as a USB hard drive, install something like Lubuntu 12.04 to see if OpenChrome works or not.
Just to let you know, I do own several Wyse thin clients like Vx0, Cx0, and Xx0L (mobile thin client), and do some testing from time to time.
Obviously, more testing gets done during RC (Release Candidate) stage of the development.
    As far as I can tell, the issue you are observing with the VGA related helper module is a Debian specific issue, and it is beyond the scope of OpenChrome project.
I am a digital hardware engineering background person doing device driver development, and as a result, I am not an OS build environment expert.
I do not even know how to use Git beyond very basic stuff, and even that stuff was taught by one of the previous OpenChrome developer who probably could not believe that I knew so little about Git.
To get assistance with your issue, you will need to find someone who is far more familar with those issues, specifically with regards to Debian.
If you check the December 2016 openchrome-devel mailing list, you will find two Debian related developers who asked OpenChrome to accept changes to the build script.
You may want to contact those developers who may be able to assist you better than I can.
Again, I can see why you will not be happy with the way things are going or how I have responded with your issue, but this is basically the best I can do since I am mostly focused on coding side of the development.
Regards,
Kevin Brace
