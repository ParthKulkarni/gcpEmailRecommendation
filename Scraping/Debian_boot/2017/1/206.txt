os-prober uses 'grep' in an unportable way, in that it assumes that the regular 
expression "." matches the NUL byte (all zero bits).  POSIX doesn't guarantee 
this, and as of grep 2.21 this might not work.  If os-prober assumes GNU grep 
the fix should be fairly straightforward; please see the attached (untested) 
patch.  If os-prober is intended to be portable to non-GNU grep, more hacking 
will be needed, as POSIX says grep has undefined behavior when given binary 
input data.
Source: os-prober
Source-Version: 1.66

Thanks.  An identical patch seems to have been applied in os-prober 1.66
in response to a later bug report, so closing this bug.
os-prober (1.66) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Add -a flag to grep -qs for Windows Vista detection. It appears the
    file isn't always considered as a text file, so this should be more
    robust. Thanks to Gianluigi Tiesi for the report and the suggestion
    (Closes: #791383).
