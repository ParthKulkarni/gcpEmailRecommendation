Subject : Preseed crypto LVM on primary partition instead on an extended logical one

Hello,
while using the partman-auto method crypto in an preseed script, the LVM 
containing the swap and root LVs is created on an encrypted extended 
partition (sda5) per default. Boot is created on primary partition sda1. 
So there are no sda2/3/4 partitions.
Is it possible to let the LVM be created on an encrypted primary 
partition (sda2) instead so there is no extended partition (sda5) at 
all? Could you please show me an example preseed script?
