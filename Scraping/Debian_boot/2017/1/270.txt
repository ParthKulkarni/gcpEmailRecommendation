Package: debian-installer
Severity: grave
Tags: d-i
Justification: renders package unusable
Dear Maintainer,
yesterday I downloaded the current Netinstall iso image for stretch to 
install stretch on a new maschine (Laptop with wired ethernet and wifi)
everything worked fine including DHCP configuration. But whe I tried to select a debian
mirror i was prompted there was an error due to a network problem or to an mirror
lackingg the requested debian version or platform although it was available on that mirror. 
Tried to find a workaround: 
it became clear there was some problem with DNS resolition: ping www.google.com failed  because of 
failure to resolve the domain name.
On mirror selection I chose to enter the data manually and I entered the IP of my mirror server
instead of its FQDN and it worked than. 
/etc/resolve.conf had the DNS server my DHCP server announces - no idea what went wrong. 
Thank you very much, everything else worked flawless for me.
Sebastian
