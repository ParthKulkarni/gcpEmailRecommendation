Since that's basically the first time I'm touching os-prober, I first
went for special-casing the partition holding the root filesystem, and
tested an installation from a custom CD image successfully. Branch on
alioth: kibi-vs-lvm; and patches:
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/os-prober.git/commit/?id=16eae6151b713e4db2836b81e7958902544a5ecd
  https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/os-prober.git/commit/?id=d70f8416d3555a772666e105d13589416e6e5c0e
I wasn't too happy about it since there's a os-prober-udeb and lsblk
isn't available in a debian-installer context (it's available in /target
so it works properly for the use cases I had been testing).
Ivo joined the party and proposed a different approach: excluding
LVM2_member partitions (since they're physical volumes), and I liked
this approach a lot more.
Tests are looking fine so I went for it for 1.74.
Thinking about other use cases, Ivo noted that we might want to exclude
something else for which there's no codepath: linux_raid_member. But I
think I'll leave that for a later revision of this package, and try to
resume the D-I Stretch RC 2 release process with os-prober 1.74. The
linux_raid_member thing can be filed as a separate bug report (feel free
to; I'll be doing more testing).
