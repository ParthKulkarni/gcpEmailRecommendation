Package: os-prober
Version: 1.72
Severity: grave
Justification: renders package unusable; delays Stretch RC2

Hi,
Unfortunately my d-i tests didn't catch this issue before uploading d-i
and asking Steve to start builds for installation images.
When picking plain LVM (not encrypted), os-prober 1.73 hangs right after
having printed this to syslog, with slight variations:
| 50mount-tests: debug: creating device mapper device /dev/mapper/osprober-linux-sda3 [Steve]
| 50mount-tests: debug: creating device mapper device /dev/mapper/osprober-linux-vda5 [Cyril]
The issue seems to be the dmsetup create call (with -r and the partition
name) getting stuck in the kernel on the dm_ctl_ioctl call, possibly
because we're trying to play with something that's mounted already?
Looking at commits touching dmsetup stuff, I went back to the first one
between 1.71 and 1.72:
| commit 8a8f565b43fd126e97b2c390bd81868c6653cf2c
| Author: Ivo De Decker <ivo.dedecker@ugent.be>
| Date:   Sat Jul 13 21:15:41 2013 +0200
| 
|     using read-only device mapper entry
and using a version built from it is sufficient to reproduce the hang.
Going back one commit:
| commit 1f329ff80e5c473414d7c314777d0f667b4004c4
| Author: Ivo De Decker <ivo.dedecker@ugent.be>
| Date:   Sun Jul 14 13:26:43 2013 +0200
| 
|     log result from mount command
is sufficient to get back to a working installer; that is:
| Jan 31 04:52:43 os-prober: debug: running /usr/lib/os-probes/50mounted-tests on /dev/vda5
| Jan 31 04:52:43 50mounted-tests: debug: partition /dev/vda5 set to read-only
| Jan 31 04:52:43 50mounted-tests: debug: mounting /dev/vda5 as LVM2_member failed: mount: type de système de fichiers « LVM2_member » inconnu
| (unknown FS type: LVM2_member)
| Jan 31 04:52:43 50mounted-tests: debug: partition /dev/vda5 set to read-write
| …
| Jan 31 03:52:44 os-prober: debug: os detected by /usr/lib/os-probes/50mounted-tests

| Jan 31 03:52:44 50mounted-tests: debug: mounting /dev/mapper/osprober-linux-vda5 (/dev/vda5) as LVM2_member failed: mount: mounting /dev/mapper/osprober-linux-vda5 on /var/lib/os-prober/mount failed: No such device
| Jan 31 03:52:44 50mounted-tests: debug: remove device mapper device /dev/mapper/osprober-linux-vda5
If you want to test stuff, you can fetch images from:
  http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/.stretch_di_rc2/debian-cd/
(at least for the time being.)
I've used amd64 netinst, with a 3 GB disc under KVM, initially blank,
installing only standard tools.
To test locally built packages, I've transfered them when the grub
prompt pops up, chrooting to /target and installing them there before
resuming the installation.
I can (rather) easily test patches if runtime tests are a burden for you
folks. A timely fix or at least workaround would be appreciated as udebs
are frozen at the moment, and the freeze is only a few days away.
