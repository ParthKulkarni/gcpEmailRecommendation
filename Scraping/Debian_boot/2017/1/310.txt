I use ipmitool and Serial over Lan for control of installation till
launch ssh-server. 
In debian jessie the d-i was started in the black-and-white mode and 
it was possible to see process before start of ssh-server.
In stretch I set a conclusion in the console 
append... vga=off nofb nomodeset console=tty0 console=ttyS1,19200n8
But the d-i begins a conclusion of messages in the console in color.
Positioning of symbols is broken, removed many excess symbols. 
screen can't work with SoL, and ipmitool has no opportunities
screen.
I understand, at connection on ssh it is possible to switch now between
consoles. But, Ð½ow it is possible to solve my problem now?
