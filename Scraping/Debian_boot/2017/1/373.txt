Package: installation-reports
I installed RC1 of stretch via editing /etc/apt/sources.list to say 'stretch'
instead of 'wheezy'
`kdesudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list`
Then ran 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` from `gnome-terminal` (or at least I think
it was `gnome-terminal`)
When there were prompts to say to answer questions, I tried to resize the
terminal window so I can take a smaller screenshot of the window. When I resized
the terminal window the text inside would disappear, so I was saying yes/no/or
escape to a questions I couldn't see. I ended up doing this several times like I
thought it was going to be a one time thing that the text would disappear, but
the text inside disappeared with every resizing of the terminal window.
When rebooted, KDE plasma desktop quick-launch icons were gone. Compiz wasn't
working. I forgot what else may have been messed up. I've restored a back up of
what I had before this attempted upgrade.
KDE, Compiz, Intel i7-4720, 16GB ram
