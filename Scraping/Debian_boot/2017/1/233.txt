Why did you not just write the iso raw to the USB key?  It is already
a bootable image.
Using any of the other tools for converting iso's to bootable USB just
tends to break things.
Of course that might very well not have anything to do with the graphics
messing up.  I have recently hit one machine where 1280x1024 didn't work
because it tried to use vesa, and the ati card for some reason decided
to use 75HZ refresh with a monitor that said it could only do 60Hz.
1024x768 worked fine of course.  It was a rather old machine though.
Since it didn't work with the intel graphics, that does seem to rule
out the video card.  Maybe the monitor is the problem, although quite
how it could do that I am not sure.  Since ubuntu worked, clearly
something is wrong in software.
Does the grub menu appear fine with graphics?
