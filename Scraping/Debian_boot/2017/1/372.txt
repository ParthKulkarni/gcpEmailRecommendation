Package: partman-auto
Version: 137
Severity: normal
(Just debugged a problem with KiBi and weasel, installing an arm64
VM.)
If there is a problem with disk size that means auto-partitioning is
going to fail, be more informative: say what needs to be bigger. In
our particular case, the system has *lots* of RAM available, bigger
than the small-ish root disk that we're looking to partition. This led
to confusion - a clear error from choose_recipe() would help, at the
very least in the partman logfile.
Maybe we should be listing what recipes we're looking at while we're
checking them here? It's not like the partman logfile is exactly
quiet anyway!
Maybe also build a list of reasons why each of the auto-install
recipes doesn't work, that we can tell the user in the error message
dialog?
