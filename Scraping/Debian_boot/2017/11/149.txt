libdebian-installer fails to build from source when built with gcc-8. It
seems gcc-8 has become more strict in terms of multiple defined
constants. As it happens, libdebian-installer defines constants of type
di_parser_fieldinfo both in headers and C files. As the headers get
included into multiple translation units, the constants are duplicated.
I believe that the solution is to mark them extern in the headers. Since
they are still defined (with values) in the C files that'll not make
them go missing. Please consider applying the attached patch.
Once gcc-8 becomes the default, this bug will become serious.
I would like to thank James Clarke for helping me gain an understanding
of the issue at hand. Consider the patch joint work.
Helmut
