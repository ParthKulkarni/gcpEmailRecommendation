Hi,
Recent versions of usbutils (like the one in experimental) have stopped
using usb.ids, but rather access the udev hardware database through
libudev. While both udev and libudev have a udeb package, they don't
provide the hardware database, and I am not sure we want to add it.
Looking at debian-installer code, it seems that usbutils is not used
anymore and that a shell script called usb-list is used instead in
installation-report.
So in short, could we just drop the udeb from usbutils?
Thanks,
Aurelien
