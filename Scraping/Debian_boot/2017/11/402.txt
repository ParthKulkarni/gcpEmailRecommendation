I just did some further tests. In manual partitioning, it was correctly
refusing to remove the logical volume that was in use. It was also not
letting me change anything on the partition used as physical volume.
However in automatic partitioning, it would propose to wipe the LV, VG and
PV. You can accept it and you get not failure. However you get a failure
later on when you ask the kernel to reload the newly created partition
table... but at this point it's too late already.
I thus pushed a fix to partman-lvm:
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/partman-lvm.git/commit/?id=b628ca59695e549e5672b26919ba3aa9c3c371f0
With this fixed partman-lvm, it will still offer to wipe everything
but you get an instant failure and the partitioner is still in a
consistent state.

Done. I pushed my updated patch.
