Comments/Problems: the installation stalls just after asking you to choose a desktop environement. I chose to install nothing (no desktop and not even the standard utilities). Just after I answered this question it makes noise with the hard drive, but does nothing for hours. the problem was already present with the previous daily net installer for powerpc.(this machine was booting perfectly with the jessie powerpc net installer)
