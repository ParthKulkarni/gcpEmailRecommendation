Package: cdebconf-gtk-udeb
Version: 0.227
Severity: important
Hi,
The banner in the graphical installer doesn't get the “Rescue mode”
label at start-up. It seems the information message hasn't been received
yet when the first call to handle_exposed_banner (cdebconf gtk frontend)
happens, so one has to select a language or switch to another vt back
and forth to get the message displayed. That doesn't happen with the
text rescue mode, so it's likely a cdebconf gtk frontend bug, filing
accordingly.
This is seen in sid but also with 9.2 installation images.
KiBi.
