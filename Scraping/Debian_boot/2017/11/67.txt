"hello world, hello Debian – a few strategic questions"
..........................................................
hi, I would like to ask a few strategic questions… 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
before that, here's my "PROFILE": 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not a programmer, but a freelancer visual artist, I would say. I've known about Debian for long, ever since I use internet, since 1998, or so. I even use it as a server. Still, when I was – a few days ago – getting a “lightweight” linux on my tiny netbook, I avoided Debian, in favor of Ubuntu.
Not a programmer, but I had this idea to create an Ubuntu derivative distro, based on a very simple and very “marketable” concept, although, let me know, I hate commercialism, too, in any form of it. I watched some videos, including the ezeelinux guy's refreshing video-accounts on how he span off a distro in between doing two rounds of laundry – this got me totally excited!! of course…
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and HOW I got here: 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Very quickly I realized that something had changed in the Ubuntu world since 2015… starting with discontinuing the ubunto-distro-making-customizing-KIT… which coincided with the discontinuation of the remastersys project – about which a Hungarian guy put a link in his article, referring to the sad-sad circumstances why remastersys was dumped… and I was just sad at first… 
but then I became surprised and curious … 
I mean, how on earth does it happen that after such a happy moment of life that this ezeelinux guy did his laundry and span off a U-distro, the how-to of which he shared on Youtube, such harsh halt comes like all spinning-off software was freezed .. 
I couldn't view it but as an intervention… and since the morning, when I wanted to do my laundry, and attempt to make a ubuntu spin off, the whole perspective had changed.. cause the links to doing it were systematically CUT OFF …   
But I was willing to dissolve with this, thinking that it would just take longer than expected :) BUT then I bumped into a revitalization of the remastersys, where  ch1x0r  wrote some unexpectedly “confirming” thoughts about being exposed to a kind of attacks similar to which made the developer of remastersys dump hi (her?) very own project.. that s/he LOVED .-. That is, no further questions as to whether there is an intention behind the freezing up of the unfolding distro-remixing vogue…

QUESTION  #1
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
could there be some efforts made, and would they make sense, to… 
a) create repsins (with less software and modified settings, such as Firefox's pocket, and amazon's “favorite” in the top-menu)
b) keep the bridge up through which people can get to remixing an Ubuntu distro?

QUESTION  #2
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Could there be a discourse initiated about debian's re-positioning itself... 
(now that Ubuntu introduces  Snap..  – by which, as I understand, cuts off the links from Debian to Ubuntu – and now that Ubuntu is reaching a “critical mass” that will increase its gravity tremendously? :)) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
QUESTION  #3
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Could there be a discussion initiated about how (from a neither inexperienced nor expert, yes, a 3rd type.., which could be the subject of a separate debate) Debian could spread better? go trendy? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
QUESTION  #4
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
not separately from Q3, I just don't intend to pre-thematize it, is it, do you think, possible to…
 
a) talk about the installer?
(for example, I've made my notes last night as I was installing the latest stable release, and I made it because I remembered that it was mentioned that one can submit reports on the installer, and I thought it would be other than a bug-report of technical auto-feedback)
a) the website ? 
not the structure or the content, not even the style, which is SWEET! but -- the info-structure of a given “article”, using headings and different font-sizes...
sorry for the length
thanks for your work!
Peter
