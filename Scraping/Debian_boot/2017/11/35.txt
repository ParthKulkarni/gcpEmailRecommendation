Hi Russell,

> I just did an install from the image downloaded from the above URL using

> debootstrap, or both.

> When I installed it the /etc/nsswitch.conf file had the following entries:
> passwd:         compat
> group:          compat
> shadow:         compat
> 
> According to nsswitch.conf(5) the "compat" line is to enable entries that
> start with "+" or "-" for special NIS operations.

> The benefit in having compat as the default is minor even for the tiny minority
> of users who have NIS enabled.  Putting in compat entries in /etc/nsswitch.conf
> is a tiny part of the work required to enable NIS.  I don't think that people

> Currently we are having a discussion on the SE Linux policy mailing list about

> map them which means that most domains need map access to etc_t while
> /lib/libnss_files.so.X doesn't map them and doesn't need such access.

> By default I advocate for changing SE Linux policy rather than changing system

kibi@armor:~$ grep /etc/nsswitch.conf /var/lib/dpkg/info/*postinst
/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc-bin.postinst:  install_from_default /usr/share/libc-bin/nsswitch.conf /etc/nsswitch.conf
/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc-bin.postinst:  update_to_current_default /usr/share/libc-bin/nsswitch.conf /etc/nsswitch.conf
so either reassign your bug report against the proper glibc package, or
close this one, and open a new one there?
KiBi.
