Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.79
Severity: critical
Tags: d-i
Justification: breaks the whole system
Dear Maintainer,
I used debian installer to install debian on an Allwinner
A20-OLinuXino-Lime2 following the instructions at:
https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Allwinner
In the debian installer, I changed priority to medium so that I could
have control over the partitioning steps.  I have an attached SATA disk
and partitioned this as physical volume for encryption with a btrfs
filesystem on it.
I then proceeded to manually create subvolumes on the btrfs filesystem
and mounted the root subvolume as /target.
Essentially, my /target was mounted as:
# mount -t btrfs -o rw,ssd,noatime,nodiratime,compress=lzo,space_cache,subvol=@ /dev/mapper/sda3_crypt /target
(Also fixed /etc/fstab)
After finishing the install and rebooting, the system fails to boot and u-boot drops into an initramfs shell.
The problem is that u-boot does not pass the rootflags=subvol=@ to the
boot command.  The root btrfs filesystem is mounted on /root in the
initramfs rather than the subvolume @ being mounted as /root.
I was able to manually remount the subvolume @ onto /root and further
mount /boot (which is ext2 filesystem on micro SD card partition 1).
I looked in /boot/boot.scr and saw this line:
setenv bootargs ${bootargs} quiet
which assumes that bootargs may have already been set.
I rebooted the system and stopped u-boot to enter the u-boot shell.
I added some environment variables as follows:
=> setenv rootflags 'subvol=@'
=> setenv bootargs rootflags=${rootflags}
=> saveenv
=> reset
Now u-boot passes bootargs=rootflags=subvol=@
And the system boot properly.
Furthermore, if I run flash-kernel my settings are not overwritten and
the system continues to boot properly.
However, I don't think this is the correct way to fix the problem.
I couldn't see any configuration file for flash-kernel or
initramfs-tools for setting rootflags.
Is there a configuration option which will add rootflags somewhere so
that flash-kernel puts this in the boot.scr file?
