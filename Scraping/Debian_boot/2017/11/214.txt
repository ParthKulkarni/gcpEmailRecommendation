Hi KiBi,
Yes, that's clearly very broken indeed, but I can understand how this
might come about. You can, for example, export an environment variable
without a value.
Even in bash, you can "export foobar", and export will display it as
"declare -x foobar". Not exactly the same, and definitely broken in
busybox, but I can follow the logic.

I think I'd prefer not to just revert this given this is a security
thing. It reminds me quite a bit of shellshock, and that's not a path I
want to tread.
I'd like to spend a little time investigating this to correct the
behaviour without opening ourselves to security vulnerabilities. It's
not wrong that an environment variable probably shouldn't include a '/'
character: try to set one in bash!
$ declare -x foo/bar=foo
bash: declare: `foo/bar=foo': not a valid identifier
Please give me a few days, I'll see what I can come up with.
Cheers,
Chris
