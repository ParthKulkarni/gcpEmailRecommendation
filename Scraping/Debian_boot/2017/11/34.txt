Package: debian-installer
Severity: minor
https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/daily/arch-latest/amd64/iso-cd/
I just did an install from the image downloaded from the above URL using
debootstrap.  I'm not sure if this bug applies to debian-installed,
debootstrap, or both.
When I installed it the /etc/nsswitch.conf file had the following entries:
passwd:         compat
group:          compat
shadow:         compat
According to nsswitch.conf(5) the "compat" line is to enable entries that
start with "+" or "-" for special NIS operations.
The benefit in having compat as the default is minor even for the tiny minority
of users who have NIS enabled.  Putting in compat entries in /etc/nsswitch.conf
is a tiny part of the work required to enable NIS.  I don't think that people
who use NIS would find it an inconvenience to have "files" as the default.
Currently we are having a discussion on the SE Linux policy mailing list about
the permission for memory mapping files.  /lib/libnss_compat.so.X needs to
map them which means that most domains need map access to etc_t while
/lib/libnss_files.so.X doesn't map them and doesn't need such access.
By default I advocate for changing SE Linux policy rather than changing system
configuration.  But in this case I can't see any downside in making the default
to use "files".  Having less complex parsing of those files seems like a good
benefit too.  As a general rule less complex code will tend to have fewer
security issues.
