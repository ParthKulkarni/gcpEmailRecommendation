Dear Maintainer,
Hardware:
1. Barebones Clevo N130WU
        Purchased November 2017
        Barebones = does not have hard drive, ram, wifi card.
2. Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM)

4. Intel Wifi Wireless-AC 8265 8265.NGWMG Dual Band 2x2 AC + BlueTooth M.2
        This required manual driver installation. There may be some existing
packages containing these drivers. I did not look very hard.
        Wifi:
                Seached here first:

Important installation notes:
        1. I had to disable the UEFI boot option, otherwise the live usb stick
was never detected.
                1.a. Press F2 to enter the BIOS.
        2. Trackpad did not work during installation.
Features tested and functional:
        1. Trackpad. I only tested two finger scrolling, I'm not sure what else
to do.

        3. Keyboard screen backlight adjustment.
        4. Keyboard sleep button.
        5. Clamshell sleep (close laptop). Suspend/resume appears to work (has
not crashed yet).
        6. HDMI port.
        7. Webcam and microphone (tested/saved video with cheese).
        8. Keyboard volume/mute buttons.
