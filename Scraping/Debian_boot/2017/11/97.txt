Definitely.
The key here is being consistent with what is done elsewhere in the
free software l10n world.
You know about the reputation of the French l10n teams to translate
everything. It is indeed because this practice is now established all
over the free software ecosystem. 
For other languages, the established practice is to keep English words
for technical terms. Even though I do not agree with that (it
enforces the idea that technical terms are to be used by technical
people only while my localization work is made for the average random
person in the street), I think it's a matter of local culture.
But, please always always always remember what I used to put in all my
l10n talks : "not every sysadmin in the world speaks and understands
English......this is a very biased view to think that". And if not
every sysadmin is more comfortable in her own lmanguage, think about
the average user.
For Greek translaiton, I'd recommend talking to Kostas Margaritis. He
did the initial work and know what he's talking about.
