Actually activating it on weblate would be perfect - I wanted to give
some classes about Debian in my town's University (~20k students) and
most of them aren't of course software people but they could help
translate but po files and all instructions around it made it clearly a
no go here. So please do activate it on weblate :) (ideally all Debian
package translation would end up there).
