Indeed.
In case it wasn't clear, I'm not suggesting we copy the exact same
interface that Fedora uses. Their system has a few differences with
ours, and that's fine.
I was more talking about concepts than about implementation.

Sure.
The same is true in the Fedora installer; they require that you either
enter a root password or create a user. Which you of those options you
choose is up to you though.
We essentially do the same (although some of our options require that
you go to expert mode, which I don't think should be necessary).
My point though, is that if we create an alternate UI for the installer
that asks a bunch of questions in a single step rather than having them
one after the other as we do now, then no doubt we'll find ourselves
unable to implement some functionality in the end. But that's fine; as
long as we make it easier for "most" (for some useful definition of that
word) novice users, and as long as we don't deprecate or remove the full
installer, this will still be a win.

Right; for the avoidance of doubt, that's exactly what I was suggesting.
