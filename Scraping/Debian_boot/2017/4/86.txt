Hi,
I've some problems with os-prober not recognizing my nixos
installation on another harddrive. I've been tyring to debug this but
I have to edit files in-place rather than from the git directory,
i.e., I have to edit /usr/lib/os-probes/mounted/90linux-distro
directly. And the makefile has no "install" target: what's the advised
way to change/debug os-prober if any please ?
Best regards
Matt
