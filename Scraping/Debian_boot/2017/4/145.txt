Package: choose-mirror
Version: 2.78
Severity: normal
Hello,
Currently, the user is faced with having to choose a network mirror,
and AFAIK, the only way to skip using a network mirror is to choose
"go back" at the mirror country selection menu. That is really not
intuitive, couldn't there be a "no mirror" entry among that list?

That's a city in Bosnia.  Right?
