Can you send:
1. A sample command line for ckbcomp.
2. The output ckbcomp generates.

I think it is impossible to base the behaviour of ckbcomp on the 
contents of the type file.  The actual semantics of the types is 
undocumented and I think some details are unknown even to X developers.
Fortunately, this is not necessary because the type files define only a 
few types and it is not difficult to hardcode the proper behaviour in 
ckbcomp.
