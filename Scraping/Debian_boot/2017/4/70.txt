I'm not sure if enabling serial disables the local console.
So expect that local console is stil active in iPXE.

The 'desktop=xfce' looks strange.
I don't know what the effect of it is, so try without it.
And 'console=ttyS0,115200n8' after the ' -- ' might also help.
Please report back your further tests, thanks for doing so far.
