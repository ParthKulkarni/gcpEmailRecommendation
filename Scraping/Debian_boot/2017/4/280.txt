Hi,

I tried installing the Debian 8.7 on my iBOOK G4, both MacOSX 10.5.8
and Debian worked well after the installation. I press "x" to boot up
the MacOSX 10.5.8 in the yaboot menu.

Can you reproduce this issue by installing an Debian 8.7? If yes, we
can collect some data, for example: using dd to get some data from
partitions, on the newly installed Debian Linux.
