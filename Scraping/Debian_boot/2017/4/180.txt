Looks good (ish!) The code's fine, but I'll move it to the setup.git
repo. The code in debian-cd/contrib is just a convenience copy for
publishing what we do in the package.

Nope. For any given architecture build, we do ~all the parsing
up-front so it's going to be consistent. But from one arch to the next
it's possible that things will update.
