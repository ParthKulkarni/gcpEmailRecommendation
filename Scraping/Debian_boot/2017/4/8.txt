Jolly good.

Sorry for the delay -- the local Kindergarten had a day off yesterday,
so I was feeding bantams and rabbits with my daughter for most of the
day :-)

Absolutely, we should have a checklist (or automated test).
Although in this particular case I think that a failure to keep things
up to date is pretty fail-safe -- we would just end up with redundant
and harmless module options being set for modules that don't exist.
Also, new options that are added are quite likely to be things similar
to the fsck.* options, which are not really useful for d-i, so it
wouldn't surprise me if nobody would ever notice.
Should we have a bug to track the lack of a checklist/auto-checker for
now, or go immediately to adding stuff to the wiki?
Cheers, Phil.
