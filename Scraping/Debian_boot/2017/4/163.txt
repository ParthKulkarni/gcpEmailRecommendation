Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***
   * What led up to the situation?
	preseed specifying a local0 apt server, and setting allow-unauthenticated to true, 
	still results in the new server being disabled in the sources.list
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
	setting d-i debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated boolean true in preseed
	yields no change, it seems key needs to be set for repo.
   * What was the outcome of this action?
	my new repository was commented out in sources.list as being unauthenticated / insecure
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
	Expected my local repository to be enabled in sources.list
