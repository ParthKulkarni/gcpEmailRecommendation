Yesterday I upgraded 4.10.6 to 4.10.7 taken from experimental
	Linux hermes 4.10.0-trunk-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 4.10.7-1~exp1 (2017-03-30) i686 GNU/Linux
and had a bit of hope to see this issue fixed because of
	commit f9955dcaceae3a6d5c747b065e1d9da1be50b5ba
	Author: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

	    fbcon: Fix vc attr at deinit
	    commit 8aac7f34369726d1a158788ae8aff3002d5eb528 upstream.
	    fbcon can deal with vc_hi_font_mask (the upper 256 chars) and adjust
	    the vc attrs dynamically when vc_hi_font_mask is changed at
	    fbcon_init().  When the vc_hi_font_mask is set, it remaps the attrs in
	    the existing console buffer with one bit shift up (for 9 bits), while
	    it remaps with one bit shift down (for 8 bits) when the value is
	    cleared.  It works fine as long as the font gets updated after fbcon
	    was initialized.
	    However, we hit a bizarre problem when the console is switched to
	    another fb driver (typically from vesafb or efifb to drmfb).  At
	    switching to the new fb driver, we temporarily rebind the console to
	    the dummy console, then rebind to the new driver.  During the
	    switching, we leave the modified attrs as is.  Thus, the new fbcon
	    takes over the old buffer as if it were to contain 8 bits chars
	    (although the attrs are still shifted for 9 bits), and effectively
	    this results in the yellow color texts instead of the original white
	    color, as found in the bugzilla entry below.
	    An easy fix for this is to re-adjust the attrs before leaving the
	    fbcon at con_deinit callback.  Since the code to adjust the attrs is
	    already present in the current fbcon code, in this patch, we simply
	    factor out the relevant code, and call it from fbcon_deinit().

However, no such luck :-)
Perhaps, though, this inspires insight into more
knowledgeable people as to what might be the exact cause ?
