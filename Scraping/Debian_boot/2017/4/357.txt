Package: debian-installer
Version: From Netinst.iso: Binary-1 20170116-10:57
Severity: critical
Tags: d-i
Justification: breaks the whole system
Dear Maintainer,
Im installing debian jessie from netinstall iso amd64.
For example (you will understand later), I've chosen "espeak-udeb" package.
When it asks to configure it, it just go back to that step (after choose lang),
but it doesnt do anything, then jump up to the "previous" next step.
The issue start to be important during settings of hard disk. I've chosen dm-
crypt in pack to load. When I setup a partition, it allowes me to choose
encrypted, but it doesnt allow me to choose "the use" (boot, home, root, etc).
When I choose for example "swap", next partition I will go to create, and I
enter in "formating", the selector highlights still "swap". The same if I click
a partition created yet.
Once I end with partitioning, and I enter in encryption phase, if I make a
mistake, after password settings, I have to reboot, because "go back" do not
unmount dm-crypt and doesnt allow to make new changes. In theory using "go-
back" should allow me to "reset" actions taken after that step, but this doesnt
happend. It is probably an issue in indexing of variable, and/or refreshing of
stage in which user is going to enter. Even if I choose "detect disk". The same
at one step during first stages, network settings if I remember well: it asks
me if I can load from a usb the firmware of wifi; I chose "no". If I restart
that stage, it will not ask me again. It is there an issue in "go back"
function to reset to the defaults options and show up again the questions.
Im running the installer on another pc (uefi), but the same "not reset" issue I
find out in netinstall of jan 2016, when I installed this system(not uefi).
