When testing this patch I found, that my proposal for adding the header
to the example-preseed.txt cannot add the header in the _very_first_line_,
since the first line is then always
	#### Contents of the preconfiguration file (for stretch)
So, if we need to have the header in the very first line, then Geert's 
way of adding the header to example-preseed.txt is the better one. 
Say: we can leave it as it's now.
Thus closing this bug.
