Nope, there's nothing that says they "must" fall back to anything.  The very
docs you linked to:
> http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cd.html
> http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_06_01
explicitly say the results are unspecified.  $HOME should be set by the
login environment, but if it's not set, you get to keep the pieces.
You filed copies of this bug on three shells: busybox[sh], dash, bash.
Their policies are:
* busybox: no superfluous features are added, often even required but
  non-important features get skipped
* dash: POSIXLY_CORRECT, even when POSIX and common sense disagree
Upstreams of those two will thus almost certainly reject such a change.
* bash: no particular policy
Yet, because the two other shells don't invent a fallback for missing $HOME,
adding it bash would introduce a difference in behaviour that can be avoided
by keeping status quo.
Thus, while I understand your reason (extra robustness for user error), I'd
recommend WONTFIXing all three copies of this bug.
Please say if I missed something.
