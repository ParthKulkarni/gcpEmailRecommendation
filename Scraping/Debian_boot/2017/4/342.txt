Package: console-setup
Version: 1.160
Severity: normal
Tags: d-i
Debian (i386) was installed without tasksel's  extra software using the
RC3 Stretch installer. 'dpkg-reconfigure console-setup' was run after
the first boot to give
# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR SETUPCON
# Consult the console-setup(5) manual page.
ACTIVE_CONSOLES="/dev/tty[1-6]"
CHARMAP="UTF-8"
CODESET="Lat15"
FONTFACE="TerminusBold"
FONTSIZE="11x22"
VIDEOMODE=
# The following is an example how to use a braille font
# FONT='lat9w-08.psf.gz brl-8x8.psf'
in /etc/default/console-setup.
At every subsequent boot the usual tiny console font is used and setupcon
has to be used to obtain TerminusBold 11x22.
Regards,
Brian.
