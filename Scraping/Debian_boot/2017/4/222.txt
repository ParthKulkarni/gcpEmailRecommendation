Hi,
sorry, this somehow slipped my inbox.

https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/ is a prominent https mirror.
Sadly https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors does not list any https mirrors.
Neither does archive.ubuntu.com offer https.
But then again, I can't find official documentation that Debian offers https mirrors either ;)
Cheers
