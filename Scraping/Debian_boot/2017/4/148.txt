I can see how we ended up here, but it still does abstract something
away: access to sysfs, avoiding bugs in accessing it from C in the process.
Both this and s390-netdevice use libsysfs to iterate over devices on
a specified bus, extracting and writing some attributes (stuff like
"online" (r/w), "devtype" (r/o), "cutype" (r/o), setting the ccwgroup,
layer2 and portno settings on Ethernet adapters). Is that something
libudev would be suitable for? If so, it'd need to grow a udeb.
Interestingly enough glib does have a udeb. Would that mean that gudev
could be a potential option? Would that just require a udeb for udev and
one for gudev (which has 40k on my system)? That might be more pleasant
to work with.

Unfortunately for this and s390-netdevice there's no upstream to work with.

This link is broken.

And so is this one.
Kind regards
