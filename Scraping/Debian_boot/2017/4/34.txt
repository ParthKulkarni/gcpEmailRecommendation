Most likely to _graphical_ desktop.

What is the age those components? ( answer might be: "about 4 years old"
or "all new", so just a rough indicator )

It is information of the  hardware that is needed.
Boot the computer in rescue mode to avoid start up of graphical mode,
to prevent the nouveau errors.
In rescue mode get nvidia-detect from non-free installed and run it.
  wget http://stappers.it/do303/debian/jessie/non-free/amd64/nvidia-detect.deb 
  dpkg --install nvidia-detect.deb
  nvidia-detect
Then use the output of  nvidia-detect for the next step
