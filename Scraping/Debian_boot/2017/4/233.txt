Thanks for your input, just pushed a patch to master. I should have
mentioned this is the fallback when a mirror wasn't selected, in
this code path:
    if  [ -n "$protocol" ] && [ -n "$host" ]; then
            echo "deb $protocol://${host}${directory} ${codename}-updates $dists" >> $file
    else
            echo "# A network mirror was not selected during install.  The following entries" >> $file
            echo "# are provided as examples, but you should amend them as appropriate" >> $file
            echo "# for your mirror of choice." >> $file
            echo "#" >> $file
            echo "# deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ ${codename}-updates $dists" >> $file
    fi
