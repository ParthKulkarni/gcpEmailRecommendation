Dear Maintainer,
(no need to cc me on followups tks)

thanks
hello,
  i ran into a similar problem, but not with
DVDs, instead it was that i had two USB sticks 
which happened to have iso images on them and 
during the install d-i changed to considering 
the second device the one it was loading things 
from.
  i was able to open a shell and get it
corrected, but for someone else who may not
know how to do this it could be a surprise.
  the fun started when d-i wrote the new 
partition table information and then then 
was trying to load things from it...  :)
  of course, wiping the second device would
have made the problem not happen.
