I can confirm the bug: I just installed with default options except
french language (and thus France country and french keyboard layout)
(no real need for LVM encrypted volume), and let it install the
gnome desktop.
The installed system does have /etc/default/keyboard containing
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="fr"
XKBVARIANT="latin9"
XKBOPTIONS=""
BACKSPACE="guess"
The keyboard icon in the top right corner does propose between en and
fr, but it defaults to en...  Setting it to fr for the user fixes it for
the user, but each new user gets the en default.
Setting XKBVARIANT to "" instead of "latin9" does get fr enabled by
default, but gnome should not require that: there are quite a few
languages for which we do want to use the non-default variant, for
various reasons.
Other desktops (e.g. MATE) are not affected by the bug, thus
reassigning.
This is a very bad-looking bug for gnome...
