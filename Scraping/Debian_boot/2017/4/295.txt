I used the install disk in rescue mode to check the logs. The last

I copied the menu items from /boot/grub/grub.cfg to 
/boot/grub/custom.cfg and
Adding kernel boot parameters edid_strict=0 drm_edid_strict=0 
drm.edid_strict=0
had no effect. This option is for a proposed kernel patch at
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2011-January/006778.html.
I do not know if that proposed kernel patch was ever accepted into the
kernel, and do not know the exact syntax, but I figured it would not hurt
to try.
Adding kernel boot parameter drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1024x768.bin
had no effect. I think this kernel option is automatically activated by
edid problems, which is why giving it had no effect for me. If I use this
kernel boot parameter with a different display, stretch does not crash.
Adding kernel boot parameter drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1680x1050.bin
caused the text in the displayed error messags to become smaller, but
otherwise stretch crashed the same.
I tried kernel boot parameter drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid.bin.
/lib/firmware/edid.bin was a file created by the write edid to file function
of the nvidia utilities on fedora 13. This resulted in an error message
saying base block of edid firmware is invalid. I do not know if the edid
file generated by nvidia utilities is the correct format for the kernel. I
tried generating another edid file with get-edid, but get-edid failed.
I tried installing the nvidia driver with:
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt update
apt install nvidia-legacy-304xx-driver
cat << endcat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Section "Device"
    Identifier     "Device0"
    Driver         "nvidia"
    Option         "IgnoreEDIDChecksum" "CRT-0"
EndSection
endcat
Xwindows ran very slowly and crashed frequently. The same thing happened if
I used a different display.
I tried deleting the nvidia driver and switching to the vesa driver:
apt autoremove nvidia-legacy-304xx-driver
cat << endcat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Section "Device"
    Identifier     "Device0"
    Driver         "vesa"
EndSection
endcat
Messages displayed during apt autoremove said it was remaking the initramfs
and the grub configuration.  I vaguely recall that apt install said the
nvidia driver would use about 300M of disk space, and apt autoremove said
40M of disk space would be freed up.
I rebooted using kernel boot parameter systemd.unit=multi-user.target.
Stretch ran ok in multi-user mode, but in 80 columns x 25 rows.  I did
startx.  Xwindows failed to start.  One of the error messages said vesa:
Ignoring device with a bound kernel driver.  Maybe the nvidia driver did not
uninstall cleanly.  Maybe I should have tried the vesa driver before trying
the nvidia driver.
So stretch works in multi-user mode, but I cannot use xwindows.
I think the default /etc/apt/sources should include stretch-updates.
