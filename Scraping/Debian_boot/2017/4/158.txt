As the original poster said,
the default partition done by
choosing guided install with separate "/home" only reserves
about only 10- GB for the "/" partion.
This is way too small since, in this set up, "/" will hold
I recently encountered the similar problem after a quick install using  
netinstall ISO.
/var, /usr, and /lib, and all of them are known to bloat (when you need  
to run apt-get upgrade, etc.)
[It is true 10 GB root "/" is enough if "/usr", "/lib", "/var" and  
possibly others are on separate partition. But the auto-guided
partition when we instruct a separate "/home" directory does not  
separate all these bloated directories AND only reserve 10 GB "/".
This is crazy. I suspect with the easy-intall, ONLY using the entire  
partition (with the exception of swap) is really USABLE.
Pity since the easy install should give the simple and less time  
consuming step to do a REASONABLE install.
reserve at least 30-50 GB (depending on the size of the disk/ssd/etc.)  
for the root partition so that at least, during the initial cycles of  
"get-apt update upgrade install", we won't run out of "/" partition.
Some admins are in a hurry and they expect a reasonable minimum for root  
partition.
This problem of running out of "/" partions have happened a few times in  
the last few years (especially since TeX packages have become very large  
and the default desktop requires TeX packages as part of  dependency.)
[Another issue, of course, is the non-intuitive manner to reach the  
desired FULL manual partition from the installer. I think the installer  
has DEGRADED in this regard over the years. I could not find the full  
manual partition easily this time. But I will file a different bug entry  
for the non-intuitive UI.]
I am attaching a partition list as a screen dump on a test install when  
the problem was noticed. Since the system I had was unusable when during  
the upgrade (apt-get upgrade) it ran out of "/" and nothing could be  
done further.
I could not even run debianbug command, etc. since it failed to execute  
properly.
I had to erase the crippled installation and start over. I captured the  
listing of "flist -l" before erasing the installation.
PS: if this particular bug entry is not the proper bug entry to complain  
about this grave usability issue (from the perspective busy sysadmins,  
let me know if I should file a new bug entry.
