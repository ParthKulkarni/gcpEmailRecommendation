Hi Daniel,

Right now, the only setting available is apt-setup/security_host, and there's
no apt-setup/security_path (‚Äúdebian-security‚Äù is hardcoded).
Adding support for both shouldn't be too hard but:
 - we're trying to release stretch, so at some point it would be nice to
   stop making changes;
 - https support would be a nice addition but lacking it isn't a
   regression at this point (as I mentioned on IRC, https support is
   rather new); also, should it be automatically set to https if the
   main mirror was selected as https?
At this point, I think it would be fair to ask interested people to work
on this in a buster branch, not to be uploaded to unstable until the
release of stretch?
