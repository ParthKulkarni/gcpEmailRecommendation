Debian distributes the codecs needed for DVDs, but most discs are
restricted by a DRM system (DVD-CSS).  Debian does not have a licence
to implement DVD-CSS, which would in any case have to be non-free. 
There is an unofficial implementation, but this is treated as a
copyright violation in many jurisdictions so we can't distribute that
either.
