If you try anything like “chroot /foo; bar”, you create a shell in the
/foo environment, wait for it to return, THEN start the bar command.
You're not actually starting the bar command in the /foo chroot.
See synopsis in manpage: chroot [OPTION] NEWROOT [COMMAND [ARG]...]
It seems cupsd might be daemonizing itself automatically (based on a
quick look at its own manpage), but that could have been another issue
with starting services during the installation process.

No, you typed chroot /target, which gave you a different shell, in which
you typed cupsd.

That seems incorrect based on documentation:
    Template: preseed/late_command
    Type: string
    Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
     Shell command or commands to run in the d-i environment as late as possible
and based on code, see preseed_command and finish-install.d/07preseed in
src:preseed.
