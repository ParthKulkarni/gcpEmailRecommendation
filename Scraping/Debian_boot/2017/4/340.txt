Package: installation-reports
Boot method: Stretch Installer on USB stick, created from hybrid ISO-DVD 
image
Image version: 
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/stretch_di_rc3/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-stretch-DI-rc3-amd64-DVD-3.iso
<Description of the install, in prose, and any thoughts, comments and 
ideas you had during the initial install.>
The installation gets stuck with a black screen (no cursor, backlight 
on, only Ctrl-Alt-Del sometimes restarts the system)
and an unresponsive system reproducibly when trying to boot the linux 
kernel from the USB stick. This happens both with the DVD-ISO of RC3 and 
the “unofficial” Installer Image that contains non-free firmware from 
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-dvd/firmware-testing-amd64-DVD-1.iso
More precisely, once GRUB2 tries to boot the kernel, the screen becomes 
entirely black and stays so; after a short time (perhaps 2-3s), the LEDs 
indicate that the SSD is accessed (for a very short time). After that, 
the system is sometimes completely unresponsive, at other times, one can 
reboot using Ctrl-Alt-Del (which makes the LEDs indicate another access 
to the SSD). I was unable to produce any graphics or textual output that 
would allow me to provide further debugging information.
GRUB2 succeeds in starting up using UEFI and displays the initial dialog 
which presents the “Graphical”, “Install”, etc. boot options. On the 
GRUB2 command line, one can successfully access the partitions on the 
USB stick that contain the Linux kernel. Therefore, the problem is 
probably not related to the creation of the USB stick or the UEFI boot 
method.
Apart from the standard configuration for a graphical and a text-mode 
installation, I tried to boot with several combinations of kernel boot 
parameters (rather randomly, I admit), but none of them worked:
The Ubuntu 17.04 installer images manage to boot successfully; they are 
using a more recent kernel (4.10 on Ubuntu vs. 4.9 on Debian Stretch’s 
installer).
