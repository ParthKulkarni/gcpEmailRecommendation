Subject: installation-reports: boot fail error gr ctor failed (-2)
Package: installation-reports
Justification: breaks the whole system
Severity: critical
Dear Maintainer,
*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where 
appropriate ***
nouveau:lots of numbers: firmware: failed to load 
nvidia/gm206/gr/sw_nonctx.bin (-2)
Then screen flashes (with errors still visible) for several seconds, 
then stops flashing, then hangs forever.
Only one partition until I get normal system installation and 
operation.  (stepwise installation test)
See above.  I don't know where this problem exists in the installation 
package.
Partitioning setup interface is particularly clumsy and always has 
been.  Not intuitive.  We have to "guess" at the correct answers and run 
it through until it fails (after trying to boot), then go back and try 
the next "guess" hoping that will work.  Maybe use a graphical partition 
setup with choices selected from the (visible) option tree and allow a 
description of each choice and sub-choice when the user hovers the 
mouse.  Most everything else is self-explanatory and you guys have done 
a wonderful job with it!
Installation was performed on a completely different computer from the 
one below. This is used as it is working!  The other one does not at all.
uname -a: Linux Minnie 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 
3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u2 (2016-01-02) x86_64 GNU/Linux
(hundreds of irrelevant lines deleted as they are not the machine used 
for the attempted installations.)
