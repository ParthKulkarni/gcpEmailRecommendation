The installation was a standard one with encrypted LLVM and the French
keyboard layout selected. The installation ended successfully. When
booting, the French keyboard layout was used  to type the passphrase to
unlock the disk and the password to login.
After login, the keyboard layout is QWERTY instead of the French layout,
How to reproduce:
During the Debian install:
-Choose the French keyboard layout

layout.
