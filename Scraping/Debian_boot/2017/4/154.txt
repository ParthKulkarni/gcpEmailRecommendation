The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the third release
candidate of the installer for Debian 9 "Stretch".
Improvements in this release
============================
 * anna:
    - Use SHA256 for verification (#856211).
 * base-installer:
    - Log all debootstrap arguments.
    - Try harder to install apt-transport-https and ca-certificates
      when they're needed (#855035).
    - Propagate local certificates using the same logic.
 * brltty:
    - Fix baum driver restarting when typing too fast on Vario Ultra
      device (#857558).
 * choose-mirror:
    - Fix FTBFS with UTF-8 entities in mirror list, e.g. RE/Réunion
      (#857545).
 * clock-setup:
    - Only call sed on /etc/default/rcS to adjust UTC setting when
      this file exists (#854924).
 * debian-installer:
    - Bump Linux kernel version from 4.9.0-1 to 4.9.0-2.
    - Fix missing speech synthesis menu entries on some i386 images.
    - Make syslinux and EFI boot menus uniform, emphasizing graphical
      entries.
    - Add speech synthesis entries for expert, rescue, and automated
      install; and make shortcuts point to them.
 * debian-installer-utils:
    - Propagate dot-containing options to target kernel command line
      (#853855).
    - Set User-Agent to "debian-installer" when calling wget
      (#850800).
 * debootstrap:
    - Strip the arch-qualifier (#836525).
    - Instead of creating a /dev/ptmx → pts/ptmx symlink
      unconditionally, try "mknod c 5 2" first, and fall back to a
      symlink only if it fails. This should help with various tools
      like pbuilder, sbuild, and schroot (#817236).
 * fonts-android:
    - Fix support for Korean glyphs by shipping DroidSansFallback.ttf
      instead of DroidSansFallbackFull.ttf in the fonts-android-udeb
      package (#853921).
 * grub2:
    - Make grub-install check for errors from efibootmgr (#853234).
 * installation-locale:
    - C.UTF-8.in: change LC_IDENTIFICATION to i18n:2012 (#837004).
 * libdebian-installer:
    - Parse SHA256 fields in Packages files (#856210).
    - Parse SHA256 fields in Release files.
    - Update versions for changed symbols. Please note that packages
      impacted by this change were checked within Debian. Derivative
      distributions might want to double check their packages.
 * lilo-installer:
    - Fix sfdisk arguments (#855489).
 * partman-auto-crypto:
    - Implement a preseedable way to skip disk erase (#476388).
 * rootskel:
    - Avoid registering options for non-modules (#853855). The
      non-modules list is based on the kernel-command-line(7) manpage.
    - Update gtk lowmem limits.
 * screen:
    - Fix terminal garbage in Debian Installer over serial line
      (#857808).
Hardware support changes
========================
 * debian-installer:
    - Add support for ports which aren't scheduled to be released by
      looking at an extra unreleased suite where patched or
      port-specific components are made available, and use unstable
      instead of testing as a base suite. This fixes the long standing
      FTBFS on non-released ports (#852215). Please note that other
      changes related to non-released ports are usually not covered in
      release announcements.
    - Add fb-modules to some loongson-3 configurations (#854553).
    - powerpc: Add virtio modules to cdrom/netboot images (#767487).
 * flash-kernel:
    - Add machine db entry for TI OMAP4 PandaBoard-ES (#857205).
    - Add machine db entry for NETGEAR ReadyNAS Duo v2 (#855960).
    - Add machine db entry for Hardkernel ODROID-C2 (#845818).
 * grub-installer:
    - Fix grub-xen installation in Xen environments (#854082).
    - Use 'p' (not '-part') as multipath disk-partition separator.
      This fixes the check of whether the boot file system is on
      multipath.
    - Better handling of PReP partitions on ppc64el: prefer PReP
      partition on the same disk as the boot file system partition.
 * hw-detect:
    - disk-detect: stop trying to load dm-emc (#852285).
    - disk-detect: match 'mpath[a-z]+' instead of 'mpath[0-9]+' since
      multipath-tools changed behaviour regarding mpath device names
      (#806713, #854565).
    - disk-detect: run update-dev before probing for devices (#843895).
 * libdebian-installer:
    - Add support for NETGEAR ReadyNAS Duo v2 (#855965).
 * linux:
    - udeb: Add more USB host and dual-role drivers to usb-modules
      (#856111).
    - udeb/arm64: Add ast to fb-modules (#820168).
    - udeb: Add bcache to md-modules (#718548).
 * partman-base:
    - Update support for more recent output of 'multipath -l'.
    - Accept spaces in multipath WWID.
 * partman-partitioning:
    - Fix resizing an NVMe device (#820818).
 * systemd:
    - udev: Fix by-id symlinks for devices whose IDs contain
      whitespace (#851164).
    - udev: Fix /dev/disk/by-path aliases for virtio disks (#856558).
    - udev/s390x: Create persistent net names for virtio CCW devices
      (#856559).
 * u-boot:
    - armel: Support for openrd targets has been fixed and enabled
      again (#856441). Please note that this needs to be enabled again
      in debian-installer as well.
