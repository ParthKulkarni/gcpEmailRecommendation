Package: apt-setup
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
This observation resulted from working on a preseed configuration for a Ubuntu install, while attempting to use an internal security mirror we have for security.ubuntu.com.  This mirror uses https, which after much debugging/digging is not a supported protocol by apt-setup for security_host and security_path.
Currently in generators/91security there is a bit of hardcoding that forces this to use the http protocol.  There is no way to override this like with mirror/protocol.  Unfortunately we had to create a non-https mirror of security.ubuntu.com as a stop-gap result.
It would be nice if there was an equivalent way to set this protocol as mirror/protocol.  Preferably, this could be apt-setup/security_protocol to coincide with the existing parameters (secuirty_host and security_path).
Example proposed preseed:
    d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect security
    d-i apt-setup/security_protocol string https
    d-i apt-setup/security_host string internal.mirror.net
    d-i apt-setup/security_path string /current/security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
Example resulting security mirror:
    https://internal.mirror.net/current/security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
This was also requested additionally per a conversation in #ubuntu-devel:
    [17:15] <xnox_> DPK_, there is one more key for protocol i think
    [17:15] <xnox_> but i can't remember if we ask that for security too, let me check quickly
    [17:16] <xnox_> (cause we support http, ftp, https)
    [17:17] == sergiusens [~sergiusen@181.111.178.194] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
    [17:17] <xnox_> DPK_, ha, we do not it is hardcoded to http
    [17:17] <xnox_> for the security
    [17:18] <xnox_> DPK_, i think you may need to apply sed to either generators/91security during install; or in the install hook; or post install.
    [17:18] <xnox_> DPK_, could you please open a bug report against apt-setup requesting to support apt-setup/security_protocol key?
