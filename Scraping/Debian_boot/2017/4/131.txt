Hello.
I'm trying to install Debian-Armel/Kirkwood on a Qnap TS-119P+. I've
been following this guide:
     http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/qnap/ts-119/install/
Following that guide, I tried the images from:
    http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/installer-armel/current/images/kirkwood/network-console/qnap/ts-119
but I also tried these:
    https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/armel/daily/kirkwood/network-console/qnap/ts-11x/
After flashing and rebooting, the installer gets stuck at the step where
I have to select the mirror. When I press <return> to select a mirror,
for a very short time, like some milliseconds, the next step appears,
but then it goes back to the same step of selecting the mirror. As a
consequence I'm currently not able to install Debian on that device.
These are two /var/log/syslog's:
      http://sprunge.us/FdOX
      http://sprunge.us/BYXM
I guess this is the interesting part:
    main-menu[1395]: DEBUG: resolver (libgcc1): package doesn't exist (ignored)
    main-menu[1395]: INFO: Menu item 'choose-mirror' selected
    anna-install: Queueing udeb apt-mirror-setup for later installation
    main-menu[1395]: INFO: Menu item 'choose-mirror' succeeded but requested to be left unconfigured.

    main-menu[1395]: DEBUG: resolver (libgcc1): package doesn't exist (ignored)
    main-menu[1395]: INFO: Menu item 'di-utils-shell' selected
I'm guessing this issue could be related to the old bugs #834383 and
#833432.
Do you have any suggestions? I'd love to install Debian on my NAS.
