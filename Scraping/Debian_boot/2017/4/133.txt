FWIW, I'm seeing exactly the same problem on the hppa architecture.

I didn't heard about other arches showing this problem, so my initial
thought up to now was that it's a bug in the c-code of choose-mirror
in which a variable from the stack is returned to the callers and thus
triggers a crash (hppa is very sensitive to such bugs because the stack
grows upwards).
But since Mekeor sees the same bug on armel I think it's not the problem.
I'm happy to test any patches/ideas.
