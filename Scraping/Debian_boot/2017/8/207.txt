Forgot to add a version number to this report.
While trying to apply this patch to the latest version, I discovered
that there already is a RPi entry in version 3.79, and the reason this
did not work for me was that the wrong kernel (the one from the
collabora repo) was installed and not recognized.
I thus suspect this issue is a bit besides what can and should be fixed
in a Debian package, and flag it as not found in version 3.79.
