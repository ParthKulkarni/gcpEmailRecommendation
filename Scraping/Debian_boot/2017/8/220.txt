Subject : Bug#872725: installation-reports: When installing with a encrypted swap, device was saved as /dev/sda2 in /etc/crypttab, but on first boot devices had been switched (sda became sdb, and vice versa).

I've only toyed with guided encrypted LVM setups, and there swap is on an
LV, so I haven't seen this yet.
Storing /dev/sda2 there looks buggy indeed, esp. since the root partition
is pointed to by UUID insteadâ€¦
I'm not familiar with the relevant code yet though.
