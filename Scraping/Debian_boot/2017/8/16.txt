Hi Robert,
After digging a bit, I think my issue lies with the APT source I used.
At work (ESXi host), netboot works because it points to a proper apt-
mirror.
On the other hand, at home I frankenbuilt mine using the DVD iso and 
specifying debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated=true. I retried after 
pointing the APT mirror to, say, deb.debian.org, and everything went back 
to normal.
So my advice is, can you check if your source http://spacewalk-
test.swr.ard/ks/dist/org/1/Debian_Stretch/ was done properly?
For reference, here were results for booting from borrowed initrd from DVD.
In those tests, /dev/sda is successfully listed.
in dmesg, after bsg has loaded:
- lsilogic: 
Fusion MPT base driver 3.04.20
Fusion MPT SPI Host driver 3.04.20
- lsisas1068:
Fusion MPT base driver 3.04.20
Fusion MPT SAS Host driver 3.04.20
- pvscsi:
VMware PVSCSI driver - version 1.0.7.0-k
/proc/modules yields a few ata modules, and depending on scsi controller in 
vmx:
- lsilogic: mptspi, scsi_transport_spi, mptscsih, mptbase, scsi_mod
- lsisas1068: mptsas, scsi_transport_sas, mptscsih, mptbase, scsi_mod
- pvscsi: vmw_pcscsi, scsi_mod
- ide0 vmdk attachment (removed SCSI controller): scsi_mod
Mit freundlichen gruessen,
Marc

Those do ship with the correct modules.
