Hi all,
> debian-installer: BusyBox's wget doesn't preseed from HTTPS
Whilst this was originally reported in 2013, in late 2017 finding
*any* internet location that doesn't redirect to HTTPS is extremely
difficult and will only get more so.
(Indeed, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to justify removing
*non*-HTTP support!)
> Marga's been looking into this lately, see #802591 & #802596.
These have now been closed :)
