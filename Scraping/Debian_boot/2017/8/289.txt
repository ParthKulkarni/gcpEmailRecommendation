I've built apt with -O0 (it seems a more acceptable workaround than
going back to gcc-6), and setting PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to its
debian/tmp directory, I've managed to get rid of the issue I was getting
when trying to build debian-installer, and even managed to get a full
build.
Of course this generates a lot of noise in dpkg-gensymbols (end of the
build log attached), but since it didn't bail on me, I guess that's OK?
Trivial patch for debian/rules attached; of course this can be limited
to mips64el, but I'd like to get a maintainer's opinion as to whether
that's an acceptable workaround for the time being. If it is, I can NMU.
KiBi.
