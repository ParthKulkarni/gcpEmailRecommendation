I think it's prettier with colored icons (see the screenshot).
If you prefer this version, simply replace the icons from the previous
archive by the icons provided by the attached archive (the picture in
the png/ directory).
The directory svg/ in the attached archive provides the icons in svg
format, as provided by Adwaita but the modification to set up the
colors. The filenames in the svg/ directoy are unchanged from Adwaita theme.
