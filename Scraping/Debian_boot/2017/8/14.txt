Hello all,
Steve, what is the suggested resolution then?
For testing, I booted the initrd's and kernels extracted from standard DVD 
and netboot iso's via PXE. While they cannot progress further for obvious 
reasons, by switching to tty2, /dev/sda does appear in the listing. Those 
do ship with the correct modules.
1/ What would be the negative aspect of removing the scsi modules from the 
exclude-udeb-* lists, following the package mergers mentioned before?
2/ Also, I'm not too familiar with how the netboot is constructed, is there 
another way to have these drivers bundled in the netboot tar.gz (CONF.sh?)?
Best regards,
Marc
