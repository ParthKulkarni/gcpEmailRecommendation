Indeed!

The main outstanding issue is that, depending on the version of u-boot,
it may include or not include the subdir in the fdtfile variable,
regardless of what's in the flash-kernel db. So, I think the simplest
thing to do is copy (or symlink) the .dtb in both locations in
/boot/dtbs/VERSION/ and /boot/dtbs/VERSION/SUBDIR/.
My local workaround is usually something like:
  ln -s /boot/dtbs/VERSION/. /boot/dtbs/VERSION/SUBDIR
While it's on my TODO list, I'm not sure when I'll get to it, so if
someone comes up with an updated patch that addresses the above concern,
it'd be easier to review! :)
live well,
