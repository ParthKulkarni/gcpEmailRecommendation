Hi,
I am tring to install debian 9 using the offline DVDS, which is the most
convenient for me. The menu comes up but none of the options work. It
just pauses for a few seconds with none of the keys working and then
comes back to life.
When I go into the command prompt through the help menu (the only option
which works) and try to enter the options there, it says "invalide
argument", for each one I try.
I have a dell latitude laptop.
Please help!
Thanks,
God bless,
Matthew Bruton
