Hello,
many thanks for the patch. I will apply it to the d-i repository,
but I would prefer to wait until we have have kernel 4.13 in
unstable and can change the d-i kernel ABI setting accordingly. 
Currently we build d-i based on kernel 4.12 which doesn't support
the H3 EMAC, so a 4.12-based netboot image wouldn't be usable on a
"plain" NanoPi Neo (i.e. without adding a USB-ethernet-adaptor).
Regards,
Karsten
