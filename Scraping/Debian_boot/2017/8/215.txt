Hi,
glibc/2.24-14 has been blocked for long in unstable due to the linux
package not migrating. Unfortunately it failed to migrate at the same
time due to bug#871275, which has nothing to glibc besides the fact that
"libc-bin" appears in the log.
In short, after waiting for more than 2 weeks, it missed the freeze only
by a few hours. It would be nice to have it in testing asap, as the
current version in testing is not buildable with binutils 2.19 which is
now in testing. Besides that nothing to worry about for d-i.
Thanks,
Aurelien
