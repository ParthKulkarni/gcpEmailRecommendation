Agreed.
Perhaps the 'diff' arguments were in an unusual order?
My suggestion is to change the one line:
  SCRIPT="$4"
to this:
  SCRIPT="$DEBOOTSTRAP_DIR/scripts/$4"

Sorry about the absence of -u.  I had been checking the more recent
source code, and opted to send a minimal amount of 'diff' output.
Here is a diff from my system - devuan-jessie.
The diff is between the distributed 'debootstrap' and my editted
'debootstrap'.  (The paste below is much butchered by my attempts to
undo the effect of the electric indents of emacs, which I tried, and
failed, to turn off.)
Please let me know if there is anything lacking, and thank you for
looking at the bug report.
Regards,
Douglas.
