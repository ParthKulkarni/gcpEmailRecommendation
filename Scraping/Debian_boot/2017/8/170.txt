Hi Gilles,

This is strange, it seems the sata-modules udeb is fetched just fine,
I'm not sure why ahci wouldn't be loaded.
linux.git has this as its configuration:
    debian/installer/modules/sata-modules:drivers/ata/ahci* ?
so ahci* modules should end up in that udeb, and that's indeed the
case for what I can see.
Are you using brand new hardware for which support might be missing?
Is the non-preseed installation loading appropriate modulesâ€¦ on the
same HW as the failing preseed installation?
