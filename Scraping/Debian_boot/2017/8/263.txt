I am trying to configure a preseed image using RAID + encryption. I 
originally wanted to do this without LVM, however it does not seem (at 
least with encryption) that this is possible. I simply want to know if 
this is even possible via preseed -- that is, to have both RAID and 
encryption partitioned. All the documentation I'm seeing states (from 
what I can tell) that you can only have either RAID _or_ encryption. I'm 
not seeing any way to preseed both.
I've attached the disk configuration portions of the preseeds I've used 
to provision LVM+RAID (with some success, seem to have an issue booting 
after that but I'm sure that's something I can overcome -- the RAID and 
LVM are configured when I boot into rescue mode after an install using 
the attached preseed conf) and LVM+encryption (with this conf, grub has 
a hard time installing but I'm sure I could work around that as well).
I suppose, I'm trying to meld the two, and I've tried a few different 
combinations but not have worked out. Essentially, I believe you can 
have only either partman-auto/method string crypt or partman-auto/method 
string raid but not both. Can anyone confirm or deny this for me? Thanks 
in advance.
