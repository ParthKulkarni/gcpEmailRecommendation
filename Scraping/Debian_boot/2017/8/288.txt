Hi,
Daily builds of the Debian Installer on mips64el have started erroring
out on 2017-08-19 with what I believed was some kind of network issue;
but we've just hit the very same issue on the buildd when trying to
build the actual debian-installer release:
  https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=debian-installer&arch=mips64el&ver=20170828&stamp=1503891562&raw=0

| E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
AFAICT, everything looks good and matches what happens on e.g. amd64:

Given apt 1.5~beta2 was uploaded on the evening of the 17th, it probably
reached the archive on the 18th, and was first used in the build chroot
for the 0030Z build on the 19th. I'm filing this against apt since it
seems clear to me there were no actual download errors, but it also
seems likely that apt might be encountering gcc-7 related
miscompilations, see #871514.
In any case, a speedy fix would be much appreciated, as this is a
blocker for the D-I Buster Alpha 1 release (which has already been
delayed way too much for other reasons).
Thanks for your time.
KiBi.
