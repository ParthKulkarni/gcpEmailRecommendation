Hello:
I'm also experiencing this problem. I've checked the content of the file
~/.config/kcminputrc and the settings are effectively changed in it.
However, neither the mouse cursor speed nor its acceleration seem to
take any effect. I've also tried to change the number of lines scrolled
by the mouse wheel, but it hasn't worked either.
Thank you.
