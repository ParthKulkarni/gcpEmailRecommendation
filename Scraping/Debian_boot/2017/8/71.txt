Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.91
Severity: normal
Hi,
this is related to #838388.
In my filter bubble, it is a rather common idiom to pre-load the
debootstrap directory with some contents, for example a
/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d file or the eatmydata lib if one wants eatmydata
to be effective already during the deboostrap process. This is no longer
possible when the set of pre-loaded contents contains files that are
also in a package, since the unpacking step bombs out instead of
overwriting the file.
The eatmydata case is particularly annoying since not having eatmydata
in the chroot from the very beginning will increase the run time of
debootstrap noticeably.
Please consider implementing the usrmerge process a bit less invasive.
Greetings
Marc
