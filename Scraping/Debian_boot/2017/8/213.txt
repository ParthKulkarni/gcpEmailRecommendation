Hi again everybody,
I finally got around to trying this out myself using a freshly
debootstrapped stretch, and 2017.07-rc3 u-boot and these are my findings
with the early posted db entry:
The device-tree gets copied as expected
boot.scr gets generated
root= argument is not added to cmdline: That is actually fine!
I still had some trouble with mounting the rootfs, because it turns out
I used /dev/root short-hand in my fstab.
This is a problem because flash-kernel picks that value up and stores it
as conf/conf.d/default_root.
Obviously passing root=/dev/root makes no sense to the kernel.
I might even go as far as suggesting to not populate default_root if it
is set to this magical value!
Anyway after putting a UUID=... line in my fstab its all good!
And now to question the Kernel-Flavors Line:
Does anybody know if the Armada 388 supports lpae? I did not manage
finding sufficient information.
However I can tell you that the current linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp-lpae
does *not* boot!
That means the serial console stays quiet after "Starting kernel ..."
So I now have this database entry:
Machine: SolidRun Clearfog A1
Kernel-Flavors: armmp
Boot-Script-Path: /boot/boot.scr
DTB-Id: armada-388-clearfog.dtb
U-Boot-Script-Name: bootscr.uboot-generic
Required-Packages: u-boot-tools
