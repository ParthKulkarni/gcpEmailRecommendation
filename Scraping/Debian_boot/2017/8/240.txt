The fact that these were rich countries doesn't matter, particularly.
Internet TLDs are IETF, I think. There's also a UN list for things like
car registrations and country codes. It's not quite as simple as it
looks.

Please go back and review the lists for mails round Taiwan / Hong Kong
/ China / Taiwan (R.O.C) status - this sort of thing is incredibly
tricky. Also, some countries / states / regions have two or three valid
keyboard layouts, some groups span nation boundaries - Kurds spring to
mind - and the installer is already complicated and arcane. Debian is
apolitical and largely border-agnostic but we lost developers because of
this sort of thing - ?? Herbert ?? Xu springs to mind.

Then when you find that there's two or three conflicting codes? See also
the Russian / Ukrainian character set messes of long ago. [Windows
character sets, koi8r and similar]
All best, however,
