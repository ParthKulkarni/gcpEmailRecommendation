I had a similar problem for shiboken and Adrian Bunk pointed out on
#debian-mips that this also works around the failure:
DEB_CXXFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND = -mno-lra
DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND = -mno-lra
Apparently that's the broken feature in gcc-7 on mips64el.
For the record, when updating systemd, I also had other tests failures on
armel in Kali due to test-hash failing... but that test is skipped in
Debian due to the kernel not supporting the feature apparently. But with a
kernel provided by my hosting provider (scaleway.com), it did fail. I
built my package somewhere else to work around this.
Cheers,
