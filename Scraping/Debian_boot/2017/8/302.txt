Hi,
According to Britney there is a block-udeb request which will prevent
e2fsprogs 1.43.6-1 from migrating to Testing when it has reached the
appropriate amount of aging.  Was this left over from the Stretch
release or is it SOP that the maintianer for packages in the Installer
needs to request migration?  And if so, is this the right list to make
such a request?
Thanks,
