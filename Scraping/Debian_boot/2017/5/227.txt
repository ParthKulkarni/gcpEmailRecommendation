Hi,
I am testing the updated ([1],[2]) version attached of a 
debootstrap script to accomodate the peculiarities of non 
released port architectures from www.debian-ports.org : 
- the keyring is debian-ports-archive-keyring (instead of
debian-archive-keyring). This keyring package is
scheduled for installation too.
- the needed packages are found in both suites 'unstable' 
and 'unreleased'.
See [2] for usage.
I would be thankful for feedback if someone has the opportunity 
to test it.
Regards,
JH Chatenet
