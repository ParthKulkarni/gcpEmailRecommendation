Hi,
And thanks for the ping on that topic.

I think we want to do this instead:
-/dev/[hsv]d[a-z0-9]|
+/dev/[hsv]d[a-z0-9][a-z0-9]*|
since the proposed patch would allow hd,sd,vd by making the
letter/number entirely optional, instead of mandatory once and
optionally present a few other times?
EIther way, this looks reasonable for r0, until we scratch this entirely
in buster and rely on simpler code for this.
