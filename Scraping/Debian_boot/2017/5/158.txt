Package: virt-viewer
Version: 1.0-1
Severity: normal
[ x-d-cc: debian-boot@lists.debian.org ]
Hi,
I've tried configuring resizing as automatic/always, and it seems
virt-viewer can't do that. I've got a simple setup with a local qemu
server and the switch from 640x480 to 800x600 when Debian Installer
switches from syslinux boot prompt to X11 doesn't happen. Even worse,
it's quite common that forcing a resize doesn't work.
Also, when resetting the VM to get back to the boot screen, the inverse
resize doesn't happen either. And I can't resize the window by dragging
its borders.
Reproduced with 1.0-1 on stable and with 5.0-1 in a sid chroot,
connecting to the same libvirt.
I've also tried switching from default spice to vnc, still no luck.
Any help/suggestion welcome, it prevents me from automating d-i tests
with libvirt. (While they do run fine with a “bare” kvm.)
KiBi.
