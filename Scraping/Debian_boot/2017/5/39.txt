I still have not found the discussion, but I have found a helpful
summary by Neil McGovern. In a comment thread there, Neil summarises
the reason to put the ZFS DKMS into "main", even though it is
distributed as source:[1]

I would still like to see the original discussion, but for the time
being, this comment of Neil's adequately answer my question about
Debian's rationale re: source vs binary and "contrib" vs "main".
However, there is another comment thread on Neil's summary that seems
very pertinent to this bug (Bug#861263):[2]

In other words, Bill McGrath's request matches my suggestion above[3],
and Neil McGovern's reply suggests it is already on Debian's roadmap.
Why, then, is this bug (Bug#861263) marked as wontfix? Did something
change Neil's mind after that comment was posted? Or was Neil wrong at
the time to suggest that the Debian Installer will include a script to
download and compile ZFS?
