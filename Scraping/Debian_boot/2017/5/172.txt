I think if you use debian-installer to install the system, it will also
create /etc/mtab (as an absolute symlink to /proc/mounts). The
debian.conf tmpfiles config will "correct" that on first boot to make it
a relative symlink.

I guess you mean stretch, but yeah, we had this fixup rule for two
release cycles (via debian-fixup.service in jessie and via the tmpfiles
snippet in stretch). Maybe it's time to drop that in buster.
Should we get d-i (and FAI) updated to drop the creation of /etc/mtab as
well then?
