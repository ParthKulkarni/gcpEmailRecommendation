The Debian Installer team[1] is pleased to announce the fourth release
candidate of the installer for Debian 9 "Stretch".
Improvements in this release
============================
 * apt-setup:
    - Switch default hostname from ftp.debian.org to deb.debian.org in
      the 92updates and 93backports generators (#860472).
 * debian-installer:
    - Fix speech-enabled boot menu entries for advanced options.
    - Fix extraneous 32bit speech entry on multiarch images.
    - Bump Linux kernel version from 4.9.0-2 to 4.9.0-3.
 * netcfg:
    - IPv6 autoconfiguration: fix NTP server name handling, which
      would be stored as the DHCP-provided hostname (#862745).
 * os-prober:
    - Remove code using device mapper (#860833, #853927, #853163) as
      it doesn't seem to work properly in a Debian Installer context,
      and rely on grub-mount instead (which was already the default
      anyway).
Hardware support changes
========================
 * debian-installer:
    - armel/orion5x: Use DTB for Buffalo Linkstation LiveV3 (LS-CHL).
    - Re-enable u-boot images for OpenRD.
 * flash-kernel:
    - Add support for Xunlong Orange Pi Plus / Plus 2.
    - Switch to DTB for Buffalo Linkstation LiveV3 (LS-CHL).
 * linux:
    - udeb: Include all AHCI drivers in sata-modules (#860335).
    - udeb: Add tifm_7xx1 to mmc-modules (#861195).
    - udeb: Move mfd-core to kernel-image, as both input-modules and
      mmc-modules need it.
Localization status
===================
 * 75 languages are supported in this release.
 * Full translation for 21 of them.
Known bugs in this release
==========================
 * An extraneous open-iscsi step is performed right before the end of
   each installation, even if there are no iSCSI devices (#863435).
See the errata[2] for details and a full list of known issues.

so please try it. Installer CDs, other media and everything else you
will need are available at our web site[3].
