This time, I did not commit your file.
I would propose, you ask for write permissions to the debian-installer repository.
When that's done, you can commit the file yourself, and this way test if all 
works fine with your write access :-)
To make this happen (if you have not done so already), you need to request for 
being added to the debian-installer project group:
- go to https://alioth.debian.org/my/
- log-in
- go to https://alioth.debian.org/project/request.php?group_id=30260
  and add a small note for the admins, who you are and why you need write access.
@debian-boot / alioth_d-i admins:
I would second a request of Innocent de Marchi to be added to the Debian 
installer project at Alioth.
He made hugh effort to translate the installer manual into Catalan in a very 
short time frame, and he intends to keep the manual up-to-date in the future
for Catalan.
Please gain him write access to the d-i repository.
Thanks
Holger
