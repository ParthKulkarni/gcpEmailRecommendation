IMGP2919.JPGThanks for having taken the time to report this issue with hardware
support in Debian 7 ("Wheezy").
During last years, hardware support has improved and we believe this bug
is likely to be solved in the current stable version of Debian 8
("Jessie") or in the upcoming Debian Stretch.
I'm thus closing this bug report. If you can reproduce this issue with
Debian 8 installer[1] or better with the release candidate installer for
the upcoming Debian Stretch[2], please file a new bug report.
Thanks again for your contribution!
