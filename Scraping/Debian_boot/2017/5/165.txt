Dear members,
I have the Aspire ES1-533 laptop, originelly with Bootup Linux. I 
installed Debian 9 RC 3, but after installation, I can't boot to it. 
When I mont /dev/sda1, which is boot and esb, I can see uefi folder, 
with Debian subfolder and with some grub.efi file. I know, this laptop 
model is very limited, no legaci support and only Windows 10 works here, 
but I bought this laptop, because here was Linux os, so I uess, LInux 
distros must work here, but not. Can you help me please? I installed 
Debian with speech mode, I am screen reader users. I can boot other 
distros with usb flash normally, so I don't know, why laptop can't see 
Debian installed.
Thanks,
Pavel Vlček
