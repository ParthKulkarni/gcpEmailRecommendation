Well, it's not really re-created on every boot, just if /etc/mtab is
*not* a relative symlink to ../proc/self/mounts.
debootstrap from sid creates /etc/mtab as relative symlink to
../proc/mounts afaics (the version from jessie seems to create it as an
absolute symlink to /proc/mounts)
So I guess the problem here is that there is a mismatch between what
debootstrap creates and what systemd-tmpfiles (i.e. debian.conf) expects.
In jessie we handled this slightly differently [1]. We had a dedicated
service unit which checked if /etc/mtab was a symlink. So we didn't run
into the issue there, that the symlink can be absolute or relative and
point to either /proc/mounts or /proc/self/mounts.
We chose ../proc/self/mounts in debian.conf since that's also what's
used by systemd upstream [2], i.e. we are consistent with other distros
in that aspect.
Maybe we can change debootstrap to use ../proc/self/mounts or is there a
good reason why it should point to ../proc/mounts?
CCed the debootstrap maintainers for their input.

Michael
