Package: open-iscsi-udeb
Version: 2.0.874-2
Severity: important
Affects: debian-installer
X-Debbugs-Cc: debian-boot@lists.debian.org, kibi@debian.org
Control: tags -1 + stretch sid
Dear Maintainer,
As reported on debian-release@/debian-boot@ recently, a
recent change in how the initiator name was generated in
the package causes finish-install to assume iSCSI is
always used.
This has two consequences:
 - update-initramfs -k all -u is needlessly called on
   all Debian installations, even those without iSCSI
   (looses a couple of seconds time, on _really_ slow
   systems possibly even a minute)
 - clutters every new installation with
   /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi, even those that don't
   use iSCSI
This is harmless (nothing breaks), but can be annoying.
Also, for Buster this risks that other installer components
start relying on the fact that the initramfs is regenerated
late in the installation process - which they shouldn't.
It probably hasn't affected anything in Stretch yet, but
this should be fixed really early in the Buster cycle to
avoid any such problems.
KiBi said that for Stretch this should be fixed in the
first point release, so the plan is to open a p-u bug
once this is fixed in sid after the Stretch release.
Regards,
Christian
