Comments/Problems: Unlike all previous releases, this time it seems it
truly needed the firmware for the Realtek NIC.  As that has never made
any difference in the past, did not install... and it had no trouble
configuring and completing the install over the network without that
driver.  So it was a shock to find that there was no working network
after rebooting.
Downloaded Realtek firmware and installed it via flash drive, and then
the network came up just as you'd expect.  But after installing a few
other things and rebooting - once again, no network.  Also, network
devices are renamed from traditional eth0 to some BSD-like unreadable
code name.  From what Google found for me, this is apparently another
"it wasn't broke, so everyone's changing it" and Debian is just running
late, but wtf?
Added section to interfaces for the unmemorable new name and that
worked after an explicit ifup... oh yeah, reboot again and see what
happens. ...  Okay, that's got it, apparently.  So perhaps it failed to
setup correctly because the firmware wasn't present during the install,
even though that (1) has never been necessary, at least for the 8168
(or similar?), and (2) the NIC worked fine all through the install.
