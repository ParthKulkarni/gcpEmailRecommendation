I don't see why not. We already need the ability to run debootstrap;
this would just change that to a need to do so twice.
It wouldn't be terribly efficient for a netinstall, since it requires
that you download the base system twice; but it could imagine a special
"non-free netinstall" image which would contain zfs-dkms and its
dependencies on top of the base system, so that you don't need to
download things more than once.
I don't know whether anyone on this list would be actually interested in
adding the necessary support to d-i, but hey, if you are, I'm sure
patches are welcome. As a side note, I'll add that there is already a
partman-zfs, due to Debian-kFreeBSD; this should mean that you'd only
need to extend that to also do the compilation at first.
