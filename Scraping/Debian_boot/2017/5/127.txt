Comments/Problems:
Hi, 
I tried to install my debian (Jessie 8, I tried all kind of images, always with firmware included), but it doesn't recognise my /dev/mmcblk, it only propose me to install on the USB key (which I don't want of course).
I installed a xubuntu and it works out of the box (this is where the command above comes from)
Regards,
Loïc Coenen
