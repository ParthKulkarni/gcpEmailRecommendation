Hi!
I'm triaging some bugs, and this one has no answer since 2010. The
installer has changed quite a bit since then, so I'm tempted to think
that it's probably fixed, especially since nobody gave more info to have
it worked on.
Does anyone of you, or on the polish user mailing list, still encounter
it? If not, please close or ask me to do it :)
Cheers,
 Solveig
