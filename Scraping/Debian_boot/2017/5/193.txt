Hi,
FTPmasters, I've just uploaded d-i 20170525 to the archive, and need to
leave for the day, so it would be nice if you could please sync the
installer from sid to testing when all builds are ready:
  dak copy-installer 20170525
Release team, I've hinted it into testing already:
  unblock debian-installer/20170525
  urgent debian-installer/20170525
Steve, feel free to start building if all this happens before I'm back.
:)
KiBi.
