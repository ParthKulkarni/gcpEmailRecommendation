Package: debian-installer
Version: 20170608
Severity: normal
Hi,
I tested firmware-stretch-DI-rc5-amd64-netinst.iso yesterday and it
didn't allow me to continue installation without swap partition on an
encrypted disk if a swap partition on another unencrypted disk was
previously selected. Deselecting it before setting up encrypted disk
fixes it, but I had to restart the whole installation and deselect old
disk's swap partition before configuring the new disk.
to reproduce:
* start the installation on a system with a working, unencrypted swap partition
* let partman (?) autoselect old swap partition (I had it on an old hdd)
* setup encrypted disk without swap
* deselect swap partition from the old disk (after a warning from DI)
* try to continue (a message that swap is on an non-encrypted partition
  will show up even after deselecting it)
PS my first try was with firmware-stretch-DI-rc5-amd64-DVD-1.iso
(via DriveDroid on Android phone) but it didn't start: there's only a
grub prompt, without any menu. netinst version mentioned above worked
fine with DriveDroid.
