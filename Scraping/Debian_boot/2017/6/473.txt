If you *will* be connected to the internet you *will* need to install
security updates;
Internet is not the only source for packages (&updates). If someone
installs Debian on 3 computers (or repeats installation 3 times), it
shouldn't mean to use 3x internet traffic repeating installer downloads.
A) This user can save and reuse packages cache and apply updates at the
convenient moment.
B) When repeating install at the same computer (e.g. changing install
decisions such as partitioning, architecture, etc.) the user only needs
updates on final one.
Most of internet uses on the world have really low bandwidth accessing
to the internet, and making (some) unnecessary downloads can be a money
& time problem.

I've participated on an "install party" where only half of Debian
installs could be done because of this issue.
