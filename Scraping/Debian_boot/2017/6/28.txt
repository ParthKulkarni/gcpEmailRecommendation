If everything had worked fine, it should have been updated 1-2 weeks ago,
when 20170525 version was uploaded, right?
The content at
https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/amd64/index.html.ja
for example is from a much older version.
So there seems to be some problem somewhere ...
I had similar problems with the manual build at 
http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/:
some files were not rsynced to alioth; I had to clean out all those problematic
files from the path, and then they were newly and correctly created via rsync.
Maybe someone could try that? (I'm lacking permissions for that.)
