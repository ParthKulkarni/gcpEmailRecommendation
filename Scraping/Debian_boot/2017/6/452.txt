Looks like adding:
ExecStartPost=/sbin/mdadm --assemble /dev/md/0
to /etc/systemd/system/multipath-tools.service, and also pushing
lvm2-lvmetad to after multipath-tools seems to work via:
cat /etc/systemd/system/lvm2-lvmetad.service.d/ordering.conf
[Unit]
After=multipath-tools.service
Doesn't seem great editing the multipath-tools service file, but it's
working ATM. Suggestions on a better way would be great, thanks.
