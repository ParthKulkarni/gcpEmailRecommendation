I appreciate that you're keen to give us feedback - thanks! But
*please* use "reportbug installation-reports" or be careful to give us
all the information. In particular, you've not said immediately which
DVD image you've used.
Reading between the lines, it seems that you're using the Cinnamon
live image and trying to use the installer included with that, rather
than using installation media directly.
The bug you're describing is a known issue that's been found today,
and I'm testing a fix right now.

In the hope that this will get to you, I'm giving you the courtesy of
a response. If I get a bounce message, I'm afraid I will ignore you in
future. Reporting bugs without any chance to respond sensibly is not
helpful to those of us trying to fix them...
