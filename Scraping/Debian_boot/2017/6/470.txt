If any network card is active, installer downloads (updates?) packages
from internet anyway.
Some people need to make and complete offline installs, for example for
bandwidth reasons (and having an usable computer soon).
The alternative of selecting no network card results into another
problem: no NIC is registered at /etc/network/interfaces and the lack
needs to be fixed manually.
And in some scenarios (virtual machines too) it's not easy to unplug
cable being NIC present.
