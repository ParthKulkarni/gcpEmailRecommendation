Package: debian-installer
Hello,
I'm the new owner of my second Olimex A20-Olinuxino Micro (Rev J) board.
I tested the board with a pre-installed Micro-SD card 
(A20-OLinuXino-MICRO Debian Jessie with kernel 3.4.103+ release 14) and 
it runs fine .
My challenge is to install Debian on this board and, better if possible, 
to run it from the attached hard disk (without Micro SD card).
I choosed to run the installer from a micro-sd card image, made with 
zcat (with Jessie and Stretch releases, same result).
The installer boots fine even if I saw that it is not as complete as a 
X86/X64 Debian installer. Not a problem.
I use a serial port to manage the installation.
As it is a network installation, first I plugged the system on my 
domestic network then directly on my ISP Box.
After investigation with my son (who is also qualified on the subject), 
I think that the problem is about the network interface of the board. 
Maybe a faulty initialisation or bad handshake with the network port.Â  
both NI led blink and the switch port too.
Here are the facts : the installer can neither configure itself from 
DHCP neither communicate with Internet when the network configuration is 
manualy entered. I did explore the logs from my DHCP server and I didn't 
find any log about the DHCP request from the installer (I saw some when 
testing with the pre-installed card).
Did you meet this issue before ?
Thank you in advance
Best regards
Jean-Louis
