Package: keyboard-configuration
Version: 1.164
Followup-For: Bug #792823
Dear Maintainer,
problem still persists in Stretch. To reproduce, add the following
option to the kernel command line while booting the
<http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/9.0.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso>
installer: keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap=de(nodeadkeys)
This will result in both the installer and the installed system using a
default us keyboard layout.
A deeper investigation found that it is the call to db_go in line 1346
of the debian/keyboard-configuration.config file that erases the
unrecognized setting.
It is also not possible to preseed the installer with a "basic" setting
for keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap and the installed system with a
more advanced setup via the internal keyboard-configuration/layoutcode
and keyboard-configuration/variantcode settings: their values overwrite
xkb-keymap in line 1235 of the script.
My current workaround is to configure the installed system via
preseed/late_command, using sed to edit /etc/default/keyboard in the
target. But that is less than ideal...
Thank you,
Olaf Mandel
