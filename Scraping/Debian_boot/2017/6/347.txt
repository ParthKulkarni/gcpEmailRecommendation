Yes. We have seen this happen. Although it being a race condition,
it's hard to reproduce, and we've only seen it happen on at least 8
core servers.

Putting systemd-tmpfiles-setup in the "After" stanza of the
console-setup unit file would fix the bug. At least since we've done
this on our internal fork, we haven't seen the bug.
