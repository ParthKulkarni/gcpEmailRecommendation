Package: debian-installer
Version: stretch
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
the Lamobo R1 is an Arm system based on the Amlogic A20.
The network interface of the A20 is connected to a switch.
If the switch is not configured there is no external
network access and subsequently a network install fails.
On an installed system it is sufficient to have a line
in /etc/modules:
b53_mdio
I suggest the following corrections to the installer:
The initrd.img should include the b53_mdio module and its
prerequisites b53_common and dsa_core plus aforementioned
file /etc/modules.
The installer should compare the content of
/proc/device-tree/model
to the string
Lamobo R1
If this string is found, the file /etc/modules should be
appended with b53_mdio on the installed system.
Best regards
Heinrich Schuchardt
