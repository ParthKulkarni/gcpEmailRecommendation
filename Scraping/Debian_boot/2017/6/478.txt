Could this be solved with a proxy server installation task?  With the
move to https-only apt I worry that configuring one will become too
difficult...  Additionally I wonder how difficult it would be to add
some sort of mdns magic so that something like apt-mirror.local could
be used for the mirror?  After that, update sources.list on all the
new systems so that they function without the install party mirror and
Bob's your uncle.
Cheers,
Nicholas
