No, I couldn't.
Each one of these discs will download packages from internet.
And if network card is not configured, people will have no iface
registered at /etc/network/interfaces and no mirror to use later at
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/base.list
All this combination is a labyrinth to do what a user WANTS to do.
Recommendations, defaults, warnings, etc. are a way, but prohibitions
and obligations are a very different way about relation between FOSS and
users.
