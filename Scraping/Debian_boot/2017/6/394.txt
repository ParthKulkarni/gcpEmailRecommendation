Wow, the blast from the past. :)

A global grep on debconf-copydb in d-i packages returned two results:
,---[ pkgsel/debian/postinst ]---
| # d-i debconf variables used by packages
| debconf-copydb -p \
|         "^(debian-installer/language|debian-installer/country|debian-installer/keymap|passwd/username)$" \
|         configdb target_configdb
`---
,---[ console-setup/debian/console-setup-udeb.base-installer ]---
|     # create the required templates
|     debconf-copydb -p "^keyboard-configuration/.*$" configdb target_configdb
`---
I'm not aware of other mechanisms, but then I hadn't been confronted
with this problem until just now.
