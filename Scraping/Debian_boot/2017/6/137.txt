It looks like neither axp20x_regulator nor axp20x_usb_power is
the sole source of the problem.  I have built new kernel udebs
including these modules and have tested d-i with them - adding
them doesn't change anything.  They can be modprobed successfully
and show up in lsmod, but nothing new shows up in the kernel log
after loading them.
 
While checking the list of modules again, I found that these
modules themselves use the i2c subsystem to communicate with the
powermanagement controller, but we don't seem to have an
appropriate i2c controller driver (i2c_mv64xxx) inside d-i. I'll
try building kernel udebs with i2c_mv64xxx included and see
whether that changes anything.
