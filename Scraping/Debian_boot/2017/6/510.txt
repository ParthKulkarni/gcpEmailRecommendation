There was resource starvation as far as armhf buildds go, and src:linux
needed almost 10 days as needs-build before being picked up. Whenever
you see linux kernel/module related failures, it's always a good idea to
check this page:
  https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=linux&suite=sid
and/or that one:
  https://d-i.debian.org/kernel-summary.html
I usually wait until a new version of the kernel is built everywhere,
but we can have old binaries going away before all new ones are ready,
that's why I pushed the change to git before linux was built everywhere.
KiBi.
