Package: installation-guide-amd64
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
While reading the installation manual trying to understand if I should use
/run or /var/run for temporary file creation, I run into the following page:
https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/apcs02.html
There it says:
"Debian GNU/Linux adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for directory
and file naming" and links to http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ as the reference
for such standard. This confused me because the previous debian page used
/run, but there was no reference to it on the external link.
It turns out that that is an old reference, and that the newer version of the
standard, 3.0, is now hosted at:
http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml
which correctly contains and documents /run.
Please update the above page and all references where a link to the old spec
is and change it to the new page of the Linux Foundation, or to the home page:
https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/en/FHS
Thank you,
--
Jaime Crespo
