Thanks for the report.
I'm a bit conflicted. It would be easy to s/ext3/ext4/g over the file
but it might be good to update the whole thing entirely, and we're
currently busy getting ready for the stretch release.
In the meanwhile, the installation guide should have the most uptodate
documentation, as opposed to ‚Äúdevel‚Äù doc hidden in the source package.
Excerpt from <https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/ch06s03.html.en#di-partition>:
| The following file systems are supported.
| 
| ext2, ext3, ext4
| 
| The default file system selected in most cases is ext4; for /boot
| partitions ext2 will be selected by default when guided partitioning
| is used.
Hope this helps.
KiBi.
