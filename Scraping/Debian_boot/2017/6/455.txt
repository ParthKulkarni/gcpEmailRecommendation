Hello,
I'm wondering if Debian Boot will have a Debcamp this year.  My
small project would be 1) making a couple of improvements to Rescue
Mode  2) adding btrfs subvolume support to the installer
2 is currently blocked by 1.  My plan for 2 is to model it off of
existing LVM support.
Cheers,
Nicholas
