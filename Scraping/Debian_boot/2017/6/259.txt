I'm very excited to see Debian 9 arrive!  I downloaded the Cinnamon iso, but found the installer failed. I tried a few options, even re-downloaded the whole thing.  Checked the SHA512 checksums, all fine.  Downloaded the Gnome and the KDE ... my ISP's bandwidth meter must have broken. :)  I encountered the same problem!
I have tested all 3 with the same result.  (1) the live session works, perfectly.  (2) the graphic installer, normal installer and speech synth installers all fail at exactly the same place.  Yes, I have tested ALL the options across the 3 DVDs. The speech synth one displayed the most useful info to illustrate the point at which things break:

There was a problem reading data from the CD-ROM. Please make sure it is in the drive. If retrying does not work, you should check the integrity of your CD-ROM.
Failed to copy file from CD-ROM. Retry?

and you can go around in circles forever...
The strangest part is that the live sessions work fine and checksums are good and media integrity check out fine too.  Yet the installer fails.  When mounted, my host OS displays the DVD icon as "ISOIMAGE" where the network install CD, which works Ok, displays "Debian 9.0.0 amd64 n".  (May be unrelated)
No wierd hardware, this ran Debian 8.8 and many other distros no problem.  I did get the network installer CD and that worked, albeit very very slowly.
Sorry, not from my real email addr as these lists "leak" and I don't have any missiles at my beck and call to thank anyone...
