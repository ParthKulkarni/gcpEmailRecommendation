Hi Allan,
You definitely should be able to do that. I'm suspecting a module/kernel
mismatch since we didn't update d-i-n-i since January. Can you please
check your syslog?
In the meanwhile, you can fetch a mini.iso from a mirror:
  http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/dists/stretch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
or another one based on unstable udebs:
  https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/amd64/daily/netboot/mini.iso
