Some folks on debian-doc have debwww access IIRC.

I've added the ability to run the installation-guide script as debwww
for the d-i group, but that would not have helped in this case because
the script checks that a new upload of the installation-guide was done
since the last build. I manually removed the log and rebuilt it to
work around that.
At this point I think the right solution here is to be doing builds
during package build time and shipping the results into packages,
which are then unpacked on www-master.d.o. IIRC this is how other
documents on the website are built, so I'm not sure why the
installation-guide is different.
