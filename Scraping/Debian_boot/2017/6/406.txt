I think you just did: I gave Karsten a green light then forgot about
this specific bug reportâ€¦ I'm adding a note for 9.x.
I think I'll commit the proposed patch, and upload to unstable. As usual
(not specific to d-i), this is a prerequisite for getting a package
updated in stable. Once that has happened, a confirmation (that the fix
uploaded to unstable works as expected) would be most welcome.
Thanks!
KiBi.
