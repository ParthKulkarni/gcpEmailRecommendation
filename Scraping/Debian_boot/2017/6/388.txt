As far as I understand it, this would only protect the contents of a
given directory instead of the whole filesystem, so that doesn't look
like a suitable replacement for LUKS?
If my quick research is correct (you didn't much information in your bug
report), then I think the admin is supposed to be setting this up; and
that's not really a job for the Debian Installer.
