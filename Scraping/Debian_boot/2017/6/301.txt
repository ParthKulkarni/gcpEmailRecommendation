glibc version 2.24-12 includes an important security fix 
(CVE-2017-1000366) that should probably fixed asap in buster. It
contains other changes which should have no impact on
debian-installer. Here is the full changelog:

|   [ Aurelien Jarno ]
|   * debian/patches/git-updates.diff: update from upstream stable branch:

|     - Remove wrong assertion on parent PID in fork.
|     - Fix 64-bit atomics on m68k.  Closes: #855692.

|     mention that the support limitation comes from Debian and not from
|     upstream.  Closes: #864720.
