One way to make and complete an offline installation is to select "No
network card", but this produces a non-sense warning talking about
loading drivers, etc. and inviting to change the selection.
If user selects "No network card" it means that there is no network card.
The warning message maybe is dedicated to another case to add to the
NICs list: My network card is not at this list / Load driver from
another source.
