Yeah.  Had a look at the still open bugs I've reported.

Thank you.  Originially this request was for debconf-copydb in cdebconf
to behave the same way as the one from debconf, and according to the
manual page of debconf-copydb in debconf, but as this was expressed to
not be a goal of cdebconf, I guess that part is not relevant any more.
So I close this bug.  No idea which version to attribute to its
resolution. :)
