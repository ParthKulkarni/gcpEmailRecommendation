Hi,
Wanted to use a multiboot USB key with Debian 9 and found this wish. I
second this. Maybe for Debian 10? :)
A workaround is to use the hd-media initrd, possibly with d-i "shared"
options, which is kind of neat for a multiboot (but beware that modules
you load from ISOs have to be compatible with you running kernel).
Best,
