Package: installation-reports
Severity: normal
X-Debbugs-Cc: kibi@debian.org
Hi,
Booting the current 9.0 netinst (on UEFI) into the graphical installer
and switching to the console reveals that something is trying to start X
twice[1]. This was on VirtualBox (macOS host), but KiBi (Cc'ed) reports
that it also happens under KVM. The error can be seen as soon as the
installer is started; no interaction is necessary beyond boot menus.
Regards,
James
