Given we're already building docs to ship in binary packages, it seems
reasonable to re-use those build results on www-master indeed. There's
maybe some history behind building it there but I'm not aware of it. So
working on an update of the ‚Äúbuild‚Äù process looks good to me. Any takers
on the debian-boot side?
