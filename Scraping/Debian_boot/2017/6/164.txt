Hello,
could you perhaps provide the output of dmesg and the syslog? The
easiest way will probably be enabling logging to a file in your
serial terminal, switching to a shell inside the installer
(CTRL-A 2) and running the following commands:
  dmesg
  cat /var/log/syslog
Your description sounds like a problem with the ethernet
autonegotiation.  Are you using a gigabit ethernet switch? If
yes, could you try a 100MBit switch instead?  There was a
hardware bug in a specific revision of a Realtek Ethernet PHY
that was used on some Olinuxino models, which only showed up on
gigabit links and not on all switches.  Uboot contains a
workaround for that bug, so that shouldn't be a problem anymore,
but testing a 100MBit switch might be useful nonetheless.
Due to the problems with that specific Realtek PHY, Olimex has
AFAIK changed some of the Olinuxino models to PHY chips from
another manufacturer.  If your board is one of those, we might
perhaps have a driver problem.
Without the logs it is unfortunately nearly impossible to debug
this further.
Regards,
Karsten
