Oh, I failed to notice your mail when I wrote the one I've just sent.
Since you're fine with 100, let's go for it; I just needed a fix to be
committed before the upload (which should happen in a few hours), that's
why I was going for a temporary decision. All the better if you're fine
with the suggested new value. :)
Thanks!
