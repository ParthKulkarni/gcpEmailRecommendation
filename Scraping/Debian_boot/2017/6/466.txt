You haven't been using d-i for the last few years? The bug report is
self-explanatory.
From grub-installer's changelog:
| grub-installer (1.99) unstable; urgency=medium
| 
|   * Revert using default_bootdev as the default when bootdev is unset (see
|     1.98 upload) since it brings back the infamous default-to-/dev/sda
|     issue (Closes: #763580). Always asking seems safer until someone does
|     the needed work to improve detection.

| grub-installer (1.98) unstable; urgency=medium
| 
|   [ Philip Hands ]
|   * use default_bootdev as the default when bootdev is unset,
|     with the side-effect of enabling auto-installs to use the
|     default without prompting.  Probably closes: #712907
|   * move repeated $DEBCONF_DEBUG tests into a debug() function
