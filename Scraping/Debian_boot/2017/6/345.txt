Hi,
We also encountered the bug, and to me, it seems to be caused by the
systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service, shown as "Create Volatile Files and
Directories". This is because /tmp is listed as "D" in
/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf, which means its contents gets removed
when /bin/systemd-tmpfiles --remove is called, and the service files
does exactly that.
You might see it in your journal that the bug only happens if
console-setup is started before systemd-tmpfiles-setup.
I think not having "DefaultDependencies=no" in setup-console's unit
file or explicitly having systemd-tmpfiles-setup in After would solve
the problem.
Also, isn't Bug#818065 a duplicate of this?
Regards,
Alex Badics
