I have testeddebian-live-9.0.1-amd64-kde+nonfree.iso 
<https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/9.0.1-live+nonfree/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-9.0.1-amd64-kde+nonfree.iso>  too, but I get here only a black screen again with show me only DisplayPort, Signal Error, nothing more.
I have found an other problem too. I use german layout, and the '_' sign is not on the right place of my keyboard, it is on 'ÃŸ' that sign.
It would be great, if you can update this page for debian 9 stretch"https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo";
I love debian, and I will use it further.
Yours sincerely
a debian user, who loves debian.
