Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.90
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
I am observing this when debootstrapping stretch from grml 2017.05,
which includes 1.0.89 and is rather similiar to Debian stretch.
I am regularly debootstrapping Debian into a directory wehich has
already pre-filled with conffiles that should already be in place for
the freshly-installed packages. This does not work in stretch any more:
[pid 13542] write(2, "tar: ", 5)        = 5
[pid 13542] write(2, "./etc/logrotate.d/dpkg: Cannot open", 35) = 35
[pid 13542] write(2, ": File exists", 13) = 13
The cause for this is that tar is invoked with -k, which results in this
error message when a file does already exist. I am not sure what's the
intention in using -k, but I think that it was there to leave files
intact that were put there prior to debootstrapping.
Instead of that intention, it makes debootstrap fail. To make things
worse, #728344 (from 2013, with no maintainer reaction at all) makes
debootstrap fail _silently_, without any diagnostit message whatsoever,
leaving the user in the dark about _why_ it failed.
removing the -k from the tar call in EXTRACT_DEB_TAR_OPTIONS in
/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/stretch fixes things for me.
Greetings
Marc
