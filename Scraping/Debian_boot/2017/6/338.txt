ACK, I've seen this too and I can see what's needed to fix it. There
are (at least) two parts to this:
 1. Add more metadata to the live image, to tell d-i that it contains
    the "base" system. That will fix *this* issue and let the
    installation go further but it fails further on. Because of that
    missing metadata now, d-i needs to access a network mirror.
 2. Add some extra .deb packages to the live image, specifically boot
    loaders and their dependencies. I've just worked out what's needed
    and I'm hoping to get code written and tested in the next few days.
There may be other things to fix after these 2 steps; I won't know
until we get there/

Definitely, but it's not going to happen immediately I'm afraid.
