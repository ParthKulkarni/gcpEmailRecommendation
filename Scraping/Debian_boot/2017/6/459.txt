It says:
"Failed to partition the selected disk"
"This probably happened because the selected disk or free space is too
small to be automatically partitioned"
Manual partitioning a sigle primary partition (using whole disk) does
not produce any space nor installation problem (tasks:
desktop+printing+ssh+standard) - leaves more than 4GiB free.
When trying same procedure with 16GiB hard disk ("single"* partition) is
not complaining, and it seems to need only ~4GiB for whole system.
(*) Choosing only 1 partition produces 2 partitions (root & swap). Words
aren't selected well for that question.
