Based on Karsten's input, I'm now rather convinced that adding a udeb
before r0 would be the best way to deal with it. Even if some other
modules are missing inside, we still have a chance of fixing this in a
point release by just adding a few .ko files to an already existing
udeb, instead of introducing it during a point release.
I've just checked with Niels, and this looks like a sane approach from a
release team point of view.
Do you know if you'll be able to perform a new linux upload from the
stretch branch in a relatively near future? The sooner we get fixes, the
more we can run tests, and the saner release people will be. ;)
Please let me know if I can help.
KiBi.
