1.1. What is Debian?
"has grown over the years into an organization of around 1062 Debian Developers."
This sounds odd to me, "around 1000" would be better.
Debian developers are also involved in a number of other projects; some specific to Debian, others involving some or all of the Linux community. Some examples include:
  - The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is a project aimed at standardizing the basic GNU/Linux system, which will enable third-party software and hardware developers to easily design programs and device drivers for Linux-in-general, rather than for a specific GNU/Linux distribution.
Bad example, Debian no longer supports the LSB.
