Package: debian-installer
Version: 20170615
It says:
"Bad archive mirror
An error has been detected while trying to use the specified Debian
archive mirror.
Possible reasons for the error are: incorrect mirror specified; mirror
is not available (possibly due to an unreliable network connection);
mirror is broken (for example because an invalid Release file was
found); mirror does not support the correct Debian version.
Additional details may be available in /var/log/syslog or on virtual
console 4
Please check the specified mirror or try a different one"
I reproduced the problem with an offline virtual machine (no network
card at first session).
Some people need to make and complete offline installs, for example for
bandwidth reasons (and having an usable computer soon), and have a
mirror registered at sources.list for later actions or needings.
