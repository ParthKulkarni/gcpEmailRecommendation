Does such a breakage happen or is this rather a theoretical scenario?
Or: Is this an issue to be fixed in (old)stable as well?

Things are not that easy unfortunately. It's saner to fix the
underlying problem which took a while to understand: busybox --install
places the readlink link in /usr/bin/, a directory that has precedence
in $PATH over /bin/  where coreutils version resides. And things go
downhill from there.
The patch attached changes busybox' install path for readlink to /bin/
as well - since busybox never replaces existing files, everything
should be fine.
Please give it a try and report whether this helps in your situation.
