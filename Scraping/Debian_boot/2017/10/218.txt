I picked up today's netboot:
https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/amd64/daily/netboot/netboot.tar.gz
This is my pxeboot process via the dnsmasq tftp boot daemon:
Oct 16 15:28:53 dnsmasq dnsmasq-dhcp[2032]: PXE(ens160) 10.1.0.24

This is the pxeboot parameter file:
===========
p# cat /srv/tftp/pxelinux.cfg/01-00-50-56-ae-8d-15
 D-I config version 2.0
default debian-installer/amd64/boot-screens/vesamenu.c32
DEFAULT auto
  SAY Booting new build ....
LABEL auto
        menu label ^Auto
# provides an expert style manual installation menu for creating seed files
        kernel debian-installer/amd64/linux TERM=linux
boot-installer/install-recommends=false debconf/priority=low BOOT_DEBUG=3
# common append for all
        append initrd=debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz
prompt 0
timeout 3
=====================
With the debug=3, I get two or three command lines, but once I hit the
screen of selecting a language, no more Debug screens come available.
I am using files via port 3142 from a server providing apt-cacher-ng
service.  Maybe I need to purge packages there.
When I get to the partioner screen, I choose the default of everything on
one partition.
Once partitioning is done, the installation is automatic.  I don't even get
the screen that asks me if I want security packages or not (which blocks the
rest of the install, because when it ocmes time to install the security
packages, the installer can't reach that site, as it is blocked on our
network).
So are these known issues being worked through?
Looks like I may need to revert to using stretch until these netboot issues
are resolved, as I posted
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=878553. Which is
preventing a fully automated boot.  
Thanx.
