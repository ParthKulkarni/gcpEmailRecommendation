FYI (debian-boot@): I've checked after filing this bug report that daily
builds are brokenâ€¦ and that release builds are broken as well, so fixing
the issue by taking this proposed change should work for all use cases.
I've filed #879554 to make sure we don't forget about updating d-i
before debhelper gets updated again. I'll probably double check this
for the next buster alpha release.

ACK.
Also: Thanks for the quick reply.
