I am sorry to hear that this broke a build for you.

Unfortunately, I cannot even fix this by guarding it with a compat bump
(because that will die as it cannot find debian/compat).  For now, I
will have it issue a warning and continue (plus make some assumptions
about what the d/control file would have contained).  But eventually, I
will remove that fallback and that *cannot* happen with a compat bump.
For you, an easy fix appears be to re-arrange the lines:
	dh_testroot
	@[ -d ../debian ] || { echo "directory '../debian' [...] }
Into:
	@[ -d ../debian ] || { echo "directory '../debian' [...] }
	cd .. && dh_testroot
(Only occurs two places AFAICT in the Makefile).  This change would also
be backwards compatible for you.

The scope of dh_testroot has changed and I have committed an update of
the documentation of dh_testroot targeting 10.10.1.  Furthermore, I have
added a note in debhelper.7 that all debhelper tools must be run from
the unpacked source root (except where otherwise noted).
Thanks,
