Hi,
Following the bump from alpha1 to alpha2, the situation improved quite a
bit for the d-i daily builds (see #879662 for context). I've triggered a
manual build for all archs, and if my copying/pasting is correct, the
results are as follows:
    armel:    alpha2, OK
    armhf:    alpha1, KO ‚Üê the apt alpha2 build came in late, wasn't available yet.
    arm64:    alpha2, OK
    amd64:    alpha2, OK
    i386:     alpha2, OK
    mips:     alpha2, **** Seccomp prevented execution of syscall 0000004117 on architecture mips ****
    mipsel:   alpha2, **** Seccomp prevented execution of syscall 0000004117 on architecture mipsel ****
    mips64el: alpha2, OK
    powerpc:  alpha2, OK
    ppc64el:  alpha2, **** Seccomp prevented execution of syscall 0000000117 on architecture ppc64el ****
    s390x:    alpha2, OK
Porters: Julian mentioned it would be best if one could look at allowing
extra syscalls through a config file[1], so as to detect other syscalls
that might be needed as well (as it stands, the first offender triggers
a failure, so we don't get a full list).
