Package: debian-installer
Version: Buster Alpha 1
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
I downloaded from
https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/armhf/daily/netboot/SD-card-images/
created a boot image
root@blackbox:/home/rd/Downloads# zcat firmware.MX6_Cubox-i.img.gz partition.img.gz > complete_image.img
root@blackbox:/home/rd/Downloads# cat complete_image.img > /dev/sdb
This is the same way as it works for stretch for the same hardware.
The installer boots but is not able to mount the root filesystem. Before there are unusual messages, which I do not see in the stretch installer:

   x No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch      x    
   x between the kernel used by this version of the installer and the      x

   x If you're installing from a mirror, you can work around this problem  x    
   x by choosing to install a different version of Debian. The install     x    
   x will probably fail to work if you continue without kernel modules.    x
