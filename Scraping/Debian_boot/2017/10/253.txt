Just to be clear - I tried adding /tmp to the unit file and it did NOT fix the problem.  I had to re-generate the cache files to resolve the issue and I restored the system unit file to not require a mount for /tmp as before.  
The bug is that there was a reference to a non-existent file in /tmp in the previous version of /etc/console-setup/cached_setup_keyboard.sh which disappeared when it was re-generated.  I imagine the /tmp file was there when it was originally generated, but it was of course not there on a subsequent reboot.  When I regenerated the cache files /etc/console-setup/cached_setup_keyboard.sh changed as follows:
-loadkeys '/tmp/tmpkbd.iDWdSi' > '/dev/null'
+loadkeys '/etc/console-setup/cached_UTF-8_del.kmap.gz' > '/dev/null'
Rupert.
