That's not going to work right now for two reasons:
 1. Busybox still FTBFS on these (I have a patch series submitted upstream that
    needs minor revisions, so this should resolve itself soon).
 2. udhcp's Config.src has "select PLATFORM_LINUX", so building udhcp{c,d}
    isn't even attempted (it includes linux/filter.h and linux/if_packet.h).
I'm sure it could be ported, but someone would need to do that work.
