Makes sense, I've cloned the above bug against debian-cd for that
purpose since it contains a lot of useful information on the issue:

Makes sense.  I have built the package as I currently think it should
be uploaded to stretch (in a stretch chroot) and tested all the cases
again. Everything still went fine in my tests :) .  I've pushed it into
the debian/stretch branch of the git repository in case someone else
wants to already start testing it as well:

I've also checked that it's same file in the package built for stretch
as well (with patches applied).
I'll wait with the pu request until I've also gotten feedback from the
CD team as you suggested.
Thanks again
