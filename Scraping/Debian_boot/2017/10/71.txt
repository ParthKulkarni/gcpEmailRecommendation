Hi Kaplan,
I'm currently trying to get translations updated for our debian-installer for
Buster.
For Greek you got some translation update recently from Sotirios Vrachas.
There is some more translation work to be done for Greek.
Could you ask for some update? Or give me a mail address?
Thanks
Holger
