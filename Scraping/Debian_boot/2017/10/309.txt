Dear release team and other involved parties,
I hereby ask for permission to update the syslinux package in stretch.
There has been a short discussion about this on debian-cd already [1].
The request is about fixing the following three problems:
1. Booting from ext4 filesystems created with Debian stretch does not
   work, because ext4's 64bit feature is enabled by default (since
   Debian stretch) and not supported by syslinux [2].
2. Booting from btrfs does not work either for a similar reason [3].
3. A bug in the isolinux isohybrid MBR causing boot failures with some
   old BIOS [4].

[3] https://bugs.debian.org/865462
[4] https://bugs.debian.org/879004
Problems 1 and 2 are regressions from jessie (due to changes in default
options when creating ext4/btrfs filesystems), while problem 3 affects
jessie as well.  The fix for each of the three bugs has been
cherry-picked from upstream and has a reasonably sized diff.  Debian
testing and unstable already have the fixes.
I've tested the proposed version.  In those tests, the problems 1 and 2
were solved as expected.  As for problem 3, I've verified that the
isohdpfx.bin image built is identical to a known good and tested
version.  Additionally we got a report that the debian-cd images for
testing (which are built using the fixed isohdpfx.bin) boot correctly on
affected hardware [5].
A debdiff of the proposed update is attached.  Alternatively it's also
available from the debian/stretch branch of the git repository [6].
Thank you for your time and consideration
Lukas
PS: If this request gets ACKed, I also intend to fix the isohybrid MBR
    in jessie (as advised by Steve McIntyre).
