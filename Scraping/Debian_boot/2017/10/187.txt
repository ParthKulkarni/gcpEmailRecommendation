Source: installation-guide
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
In the installation guide ch06s04 the process of loading firmware is
described. Now, it mentions that one posibility is including the firmware in
a second media or partition, but by looking at the contents of the installer
image one can see that there's a folder named /firmware in there, which
contains the firmware-linux-free package. If a user loads the image onto a USB
stick, that user could potentially just put any additional formware packages 
into that folder and the system should then just use those.
Looking at the unofficial build of the iso from here:
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/
it looks like that all that they've really done.
