Hi,
debian-installer uses compat 7, a build/ directory, and its daily-build
script is started from this directory. Makefiles use dh_testroot from
that directory, and starting with 10.10, the build is broken because of:
| dh_testroot: "debian/control" not found. Are you sure you are in the correct directory?
The changes were obvious since 10.9.2 (known good), but I've confirmed
anyway (through bisection) that it's caused by:
| commit 087be1a300581b989aa38227693a8a6f112408f9 (refs/bisect/bad)

|     Add minimal RÂ³ support for debhelper

|     Signed-off-by: Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net>
It seems to me that's due to the getpackages call addition, but I don't
think it's reasonable for debhelper to break compat 7 this way. Also,
even if one might object d-i is abusing dh_testroot (or using it
incorrectly), its documented purpose is:
| dh_testroot simply checks to see if you are root. If not, it exits
| with an error. Debian packages must be built as root, though you can
| use fakeroot(1)
