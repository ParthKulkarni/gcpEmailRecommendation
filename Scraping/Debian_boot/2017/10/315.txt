Hi,
We've been missing d-i daily build uploads for kfreebsd-* since
2017-10-13:

At first I wasn't sure what caused this because I didn't change anything
on dillon regarding authorized_keys (just checked: /etc/ssh/userkeys/d-i
was last modified 2017-10-01), and dillon wasn't upgraded to stretch
until a few days ago (2017-10-23).
On further investigation, it seems IPv6 addresses changed for both
machines. I've just modified dillon's configuration accordingly to
account for the native IPv6 addresses, and next builds should show
up again.
