PC still works fine for me, with Stretch the only problem is, that the resume from suspend
does not work with GDM3.
I normally do not want the system to suspend, when the power putton is pressed, but to
shut down, and resuming is not workable either, to be honest. I guess the
power-button-behaviour would be configurable.
