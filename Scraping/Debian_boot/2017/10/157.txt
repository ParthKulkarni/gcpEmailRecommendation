This is slightly tricky - not completely impossible but you need to be
very clear which USB stick is which at all times :)
DD a netinst to one USB stick.
Plug in the other USB - make it a large one - greater than 16GB would be
my prreference.
Do an expert install which will ask questions at low priority.
Standard installation includes enough to bring up a command line
environment well.
No tasks installed at all will result in only installing about 300
packages altogether.
Installing GRUB ought to be asked as a question.
[And no, I haven't get two USB sticks to try it now to see how well it
works for you.]
All the best,
Andy
