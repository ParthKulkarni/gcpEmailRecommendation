Constraints when accomplishing this goal:
  1. the installer will be on a USB flash drive.
  2. the installation target will also be a USB flash drive.
     The underlying purpose is having a Debian system available
     to any machine capable of booting from a USB flash drive.
     This implies installing Grub to MBR of the flash drive.
Two Questions:
My long term goal is a "minimal" install -- my precise definition of 
"minimal" to be specified.
Section B.4.10. "Package selection" says in part "You can also choose to 
install no tasks, ...  We recommend always including the standard task." 
I need to know what is installed when no tasks are specified
Section B.4.11. "Boot loader installation" covers when/where Grub is 
installed. I'll always install to _*A*_ MBR. I need to force the 
installer to ask which device is target. It is unclear to me.
I note that

says "d-i grub-installer/choose_bootdev select manual". But I do not see 
anything similar in Section B.4.11.
