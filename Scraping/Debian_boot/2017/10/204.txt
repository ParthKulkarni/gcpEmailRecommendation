The idea is to have one GPG file per codename and then let 50mirror
deduce the codename from the Release file and use
/usr/share/keyrings/${codename}.gpg for this? Right now a lot of this
information isn't really available to the scripts because it isn't
needed, after all the chroot that has just been bootstrapped will
contain the trusted keys in a single keyring.

Any idea where these should then actually live? It should be /etc
because it's local configuration, I think. This mechanism loses the key
agility we have with debian-archive-keyring and the reference of a file
updatable by a package instead of a single key but that's maybe fair in
the context of local configuration[*].
Kind regards

[*] But nevertheless I guess also inventing some way to transition from
key to key on a repo metadata basis would be nice to have eventually.
