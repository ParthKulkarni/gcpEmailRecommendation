The reason for apt complaining here now is that the Release file says:
| Components: main contrib non-free
The later of the two components mentioned in the sources.list is hence
not officially supported by the repository (at least as far as apt is
reasoning now â€“ the same guess it makes for Architectures and co).
So, what we could do is asking ftpmasters to change that field to:
Components: main contrib non-free main/debian-installer contrib/debian-installer non-free/debian-installer
and be done.
Then this was mentioned last week on IRC I got the impression that it
might make sense to not do this through as these d-i components, while
they are part of the release, are not really for human consumption, so
that keeping them on a needs-to-know basis might be better â€“ but I am
not sure how that should be implemented and what the point would be in
the end as the Release isn't for human consumption eitherâ€¦

[Does the installer need Translation-en for "main"? If not perhaps write:
| deb [lang=none] http://localhost/debian buster main main/debian-installer
Which is supported for a few releases now (and previously silently ignored).]

Yes, the Contents files for 'main' where fetched, but apt couldn't get
them for 'main/debian-installer'. The same logic applies to all files
apt is told to download â€“ it doesn't discriminate between files it needs
itself and files others have told them to get as well all too much.

The thing is that apt suspects a misconfiguration with these warnings;
if it wouldn't suspect it, it would be as silent as before (as those
files are "optional" in indextarget-config speak). That it isn't
complaining about Packages/Sources is just because it happens to look
for the files in the Release file first and finds them, so it never
wonders why it couldn't find them identifying a misconfiguration as
potential reason. It isn't really guaranteed that apt is configured to
fetch Packages/Sources for all sources.list entries through and even if
it is the files might be empty (and hence allowed to be missing from the
Release file, which apt supports e.g. for Packages files if the arch is
mentioned in Architectures. Debian doesn't make use of this yet through
and I don't know how other tools might react if it would).
So we can't really go with a logic of "if any file from this component
can be downloaded" as that set might very well be empty. We also can't
look if the Release file contains any file for this component as we
don't really know what is the component in the filepath:
"main/debian-installer/some/file" might be from the component "main",
"main/debian-installer" or "main/debian-installer/some".
As said, I am not sure. In the end reassigning to ftpmaster might be the
best option, but I am open for other opinions.
