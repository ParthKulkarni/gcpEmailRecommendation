Thanks for the heads-up, we'll try to get this fixed as soon as
possible. For the moment, I'm somewhat confused about the affected
distributions as listed in the security tracker. Could you please check?

The reproducer works for all distributions here, back to and including
wheezy.

This one works for sid and buster only. Otherwise, it just returns
"lzma: unexpected EOF".
Also, I noticed upstream did not provide a fix yet. I'll try to help,
details in the upstream bug tracker soon-ish.
