Package: task-gnome-desktop
Version: 3.41
Tags: patch
I am attaching a patch (in my next email) to drop some recommends from
task-gnome-desktop. A few of these are already recommended by 'gnome'
so they are unnecessary here.
A few others were intentionally dropped by the Debian GNOME team in
preparation for Stretch so it was a bit of a surprise to discover
somewhat late in the Stretch Freeze that those package decisions were
being overriden for new installs: specifically synaptic and the
libreoffice metapackage (specific LibreOffice apps are still pulled in
by 'gnome').
On behalf of the Debian GNOME team,
Jeremy Bicha
