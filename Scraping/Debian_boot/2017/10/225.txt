Hi Lukas,
And thanks for your mail. I'm adding debian-boot@ for their information.

It might be a good idea to have a bug report against syslinux as well,
which can be used for version tracking purposes, which is most
appreciated by people handling stable-proposed-updates requests (we
usually consider this mandatory, even if we sometimes let a few
exceptions go through).

On top of the stretch package? It's always reassuring for stable release
managers to have people actually test packages for stable.

That seems reassuring enough as far as I'm concerned.

That seems like an appropriate course of action indeed.

Your proposed changes fit the stable-proposed-updates criteria exactly,
with fixes in unstable, backports/cherry-picks to stretch already tested
and confirmed good, and reasonably-sized diffs. Really nice!

I think debian-cd@ is most qualified on this topic, I'm not sure d-i
uses syslinux for many things except for booting from an ISO anyway.
Consequently, what follows is just generic advice:
If you get a green light from debian-cd@, I think you only need to:
 - open a bug report for bug #3 (see my first paragraph);
 - open a pu request with a source debdiff against the package in
   stretch with an appropriate version number (probably
   3:6.03+dfsg-14.1+deb9u1); including as many details as in this
   mail would probably do the trick.
