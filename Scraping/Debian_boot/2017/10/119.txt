Hi,
I'm currently trying to get translations updated for our debian-installer for
Buster.
For your language the translation has some work to do.
Since you are the last translator, I want to ask if you could take some time
to update it?
That would be really great!
Repository is here: https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/d-i/trunk/packages/po/
Translation statistics can be found here: https://d-i.debian.org/l10n-stats/
Feel free to ask, if you have any questions!
Thanks
Holger
