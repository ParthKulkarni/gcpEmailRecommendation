I think this is basically a reasonable thing to do, but it seems to me
that it's going to cause rescue-mode to list LVs twice (see the
choose_root function).  Could you fix that?  A sensible approach would
probably be to exclude entries from LVMPARTS that are already in
PARTITIONS, and we can simplify that later once the new list-devices is
in place.

"mr grep" is useful here, as there aren't all that many.

I could go either way on this, but I think it would probably make most
sense to exclude partitions already in use by VGs.  "list-devices
partition" is generally used to offer menus of partitions to find
various files on, for which in-use PVs aren't going to be eligible; and
the LVM assembly code uses its own code to find partitions.
