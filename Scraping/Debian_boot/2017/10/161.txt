Well, the HP t5325 u-boot configuration sets root=/dev/sda1, which we
cannot rely on.  Historically, flash-kernel sets
Bootloader-Sets-Incorrect-Root if the default config sets a root=
parameter.
Maybe the HP t5325 situation is different because the default config
doesn't work anyway with Debian and you have to modify it, so you may
just as well modify root= too.
In any case, this device was never supported by HP t5325 anyway so I
don't mind either way.
