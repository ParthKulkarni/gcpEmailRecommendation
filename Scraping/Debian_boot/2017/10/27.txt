Since my ticket is 2 years old in 10 days, I'm not sure exactly what I 
was doing to trigger this (call it a bad bug report on my part :) but I 
think what was going on (and writing it down again freshens my memory) 
we have an "embedded" jessie rootfs filesystem, and after post-install, 
we run a busybox --install to 'fill in the blanks'.
Because busybox's readlink has as you say precedence, flash-kernel in 
this case, fails to work as busybox's readlink is not as complete (or 
not fully compatible).
Which would be kind of an ugly workaround imo. As you first run busybox 
--install to 'fill in the blank' and still have to go fix things 
manually afterwards.
This sounds quite reasonable and should work rather well, even better 
(but that's beyond a simple patch like this) would be if busybox 
--install would check if something exists, and not install the duplicate 
(unless --force is supplied (without overwriting))
Since we haven't switched to flash-kernel, we haven't had the issue yet, 
but once it does; I'll definitely check this if it works now!
