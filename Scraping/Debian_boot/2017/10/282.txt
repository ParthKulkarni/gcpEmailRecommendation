Hi,
Finally reporting this, which started a while ago:
| root@wodi:/# apt-get update
| Get:1 http://localhost/debian buster InRelease [136 kB]
| Get:2 http://localhost/debian buster/main Translation-en [5530 kB]
| Get:3 http://localhost/debian buster/main/debian-installer amd64
| Packages [50.5 kB]
| Fetched 5716 kB in 1s (5065 kB/s)                                
| Reading package lists... Done
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/i18n/Translation-en' as repository 'http://localhost/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
which is obtained by adding main/debian-installer to sources.list:
| deb http://localhost/debian buster main main/debian-installer
There's no reason for translations to be present in the archive for the
main/debian-installer component, so it's perfectly OK not to find this
file.
James Clarke traced this to the following commit, that's why I'm filing
this against 1.5~alpha1:
| commit d7c92411dc1f4c6be098d1425f9c1c075e0c2154
| Author: David Kalnischkies <david@kalnischkies.de>
| Date:   Sun May 28 19:18:30 2017 +0200
| 
|     warn if an expected file can't be acquired
|     
|     If we couldn't find an entry for a Sources file we would generate an
|     error while for a Packages file we would silently skip it due to
|     assuming it is missing because it is empty. We can do better by checking
|     if the repository declares that it supports a component we want to get
|     the file from and if not say so and hint at the user making a typo.
|     
|     An example were this helps is mozilla.debian.net which dropped the
|     firefox-aurora component (as upstream did) meaning no upgrades until the
|     user notices manually that the repository doesn't provide packages
|     anymore. With this commit warnings are raised hopefully causing the user
|     to investigate what is wrong (sooner).
I understand the sentiment behind this warning but it's slightly painful
to stumble upon this in any chroot used for d-i development purposes.
It can get worse depending on locales and installed packages, e.g.:
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/i18n/Translation-en' as repository 'http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/i18n/Translation-en_GB' as repository 'http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/Contents-amd64' as repository 'http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
The latter being likely due to having apt-file installed in that chroot.
It seems buggy anyway: installing apt-file in a clean buster chroot,
enabling the Contents-udeb stanza in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt-file.conf
then running apt-get update leads to:
| root@wodi:/# apt-get update
| Hit:1 http://localhost/debian buster InRelease
| Get:2 http://localhost/debian buster/main amd64 Contents (deb) [32.2 MB]
| Get:3 http://localhost/debian buster/main amd64 Contents (udeb) [38.0 kB]
| Fetched 32.2 MB in 4s (6659 kB/s)                                           
| Reading package lists... Done
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/i18n/Translation-en' as repository 'http://localhost/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/Contents-amd64' as repository 'http://localhost/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
| W: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/debian-installer/Contents-udeb-amd64' as repository 'http://localhost/debian buster InRelease' doesn't have the component 'main/debian-installer' (component misspelt in sources.list?)
so Contents files were fetched anyway, from the correct locations.
I'm not sure what could be done. Handling debian-installer specifically
doesn't sound too good. Maybe you could look whether a matching Packages
or Sources file (depending on what you're fetching) exists, and disable
warnings for extra files (Translations, Contents) if files were found in
the first place. You would still catch obvious typos without generating
noise when those extra files aren't found?
Thanks for considering.
