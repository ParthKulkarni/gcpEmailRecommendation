Comments/Problems:
Based on the inwstructions at
http://josefsipek.net/docs/s390-linux/hercules-s390.html (which really
should find a home on the Debian wiki, but that as an aside) I created a
file "debian.cnf" with the following contents:
----------

----------
Next, I created a file "dasd/3390.LINUX.0120" with the following command:
  dasdinit -lfs -linux dasd/3390.LINUX.0120 3390-3 LIN120 8000
Next, I downloaded the "initrd.debian", "kernel.debian", and
"parmfile.debian" from the most recent successful d-i daily build.
Finally, I started hercules like so:
  sudo hercules -f debian.cnf
and entered the (hercules) command "ipl c".
When the initrd, kernel, and parmfile are from a jessie install, this
works. When they are from stretch or later(!) however, it does not. The
kernel boots, and it seems to be doing a bit of initialization, but then
it stops at:

After this "Configure the network device", d-i *should* show the
template for me to select the network device type. It does not, however;
it just sits at the "Configure the network device" line.
For comparison, on jessie that looks like this:
