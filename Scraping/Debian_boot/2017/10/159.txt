Package: flash-kernel
Version: 3.79
The machine configuration for "HP t5325 Thin Client" defined in /usr/share/flash-kernel/db/all.db has Bootloader-Sets-Incorrect-Root field set to 'yes'. It is best if that field (Bootloader-Sets-Incorrect-Root) is not set for HP t5325 Thin Client.
The U-BOOT environment of the device supports passing boot arguments which can be used to specify the device holding the rootfs. Having the said field set to 'yes' hides the capability of the device - so that the convenience of changing the boot argument via U-BOOT environment to specify a different rootfs is lost.
I have verified that the corresponding setting can be negated via the /etc/flash-kernel/db file by having the following two lines:
Machine: HP t5325 Thin Client
Bootloader-Sets-Incorrect-Root: no
However, it would be much better to have the defaults as defined in the database included in the flash-kernel package reflect the capability of the device.
