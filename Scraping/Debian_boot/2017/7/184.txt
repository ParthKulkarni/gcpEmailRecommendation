Hi,
I'd like to fix a grub-installer issue: support for systems with a large
number of disks was added late in the stretch release cycle, broke a
more general use case, but my regression fix broke the many-discs JBOD
feature we tried to add. Despite long lines, this patch is just fixing a
missing /dev prefix.
Changelog entry:
| grub-installer (1.140+deb9u1) stretch; urgency=medium
| 
|   * Apply another patch by Hideki Yamane to fix support for systems with a
|     large number of disks, since the regression fix in the previous upload
|     was incomplete (Closes: #839894).
|

(Not applicable for jessie.)
Thanks for considering.
KiBi.
