I've found the problem now.
vmdebootstrap explicitly locks the password for root in /etc/shadow
using "passwd -l". That changes the crypted root passwd from "*" to
"!*". Later on, user-setup-udeb in the installer only looks for a
locked root account containing "*". It doesn't recognise the "!*" and
assumes that's a valid password so doesn't change it.
I'll get user-setup-udeb fixed, but for now I have a quick-hack fix in
live-customise.sh to replace '!*' with '*'. All works after that
point.  \o/
