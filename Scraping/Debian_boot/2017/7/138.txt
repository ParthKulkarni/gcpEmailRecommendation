The installation on /dev/sda did run normally without problems. On /dev/sdb, and sdc was not possible. The grub installation finished and I rebooted the system. Have made this 5 times with allways deferent errors. First time comes:
Gave up waiting for root device. Common problems:
  — Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
    — Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)
    — Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)
  — Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/6a057f29-6867-4493-af58-3d21587d22ff does not exist.   
Dropping to a shell!
BusyBox v.1.21.1 (Debian 1:1.22.0-9+deb8u1) built-in shell (ash)   
Enter 'help' for list of built-in commands.  
(initramfs)
----------------------------------
After the second install:
error: no such partition
Entering rescue mode...
grub rescue›
------------------------
And last time:
error: file ´/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod´ not found.
Entering rescue mode...
grub rescue›
This on a PC with Intel i5.
If I go to repair with rescue mode, in all of the /dev/sdX can`t install grub. Comes a red windows with “fatal error" The same if I test with Install-CD on USB-Stick. Also have tested after installations, repair with “Super Grub” This can´t find any way to repair also. 
Best regards
