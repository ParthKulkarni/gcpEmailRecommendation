Package: debhelper
Version: 10.2.5
Severity: normal
Following up on an observation I made in #868674:
udebs are currently compressed with "xz -1 -extreme",
while normal packages are compressed with "xz -6".
"xz -1" requires 2 MiB memory for decompression and
"xz -6" requires 9 MiB memory for decompression.
Is there any situation left where these 7 MiB difference still matter?
Is there is no situation left where 9 MiB memory usage for
decompression are a problem, then "xz -6 -extreme" would
be a better choice.
