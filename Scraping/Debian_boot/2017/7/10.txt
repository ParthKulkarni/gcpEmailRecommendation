I have a bug found on this medium: debian-live-9.0.0-amd64-kde.iso
I use german layout, and the '_' sign is not on the right place of my keyboard, it is on 'ÃŸ' that sign.
This bug is only on the live system. On my installed system which is: debian-9.0.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso, allthing is all right with the german keyboard layout.
Yours sincerely
a debian user, who loves debian.
