Yes, I tried using the installer image with the nonfree repository. The
wifi adapter is neither detected nor identified as unknown.
The original (Debian 8.7 installation) behavior was that the installer
would stop and wait for me to choose the network interface across which to
install.  It would then prompt for me to choose the wifi network, prompt
for the WPA key, connect, and continue with the install.  This was normal.
Then a problem came up where it looped.  It would stop so I could choose
the network adapter, then the wifi network, and then set the key.   Then it
would loop to asking me again to choose the wifi network and set the key.
This was the behavior starting around Debian 8.8.
Now it doesn't identify the wifi adapter at all.
The online research I've done so far indicates that the kernel version may
have an impact on rather a number of RealTek 802.11n adapters.  A fix is in
the works, but kernel.org reports it's in staging process at the moment.
