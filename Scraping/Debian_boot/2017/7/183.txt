Package: debian-installer
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
I select danish keyboard layout and select to install GNOME during Debian 9
installation.
But after the system boots and i log in to GNOME it says "en" in the toppanel.
I can click the "en" to switch to "da".
I would like "da" to be selected as default when that is what i choose during
installation and i dont know "en" to be there.
