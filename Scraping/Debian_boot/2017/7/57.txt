Comments/Problems: The screen goes black, Do not carry any of the options, neither graphic, nor expert, Only the 32 bit version can be installed, But debian 9 does not allow 64bit version installation, But debian jessie 8 64bits if allowed
in debian 9 I had to add files the EFI 32bit , in debian 9 the EFI 64 bit does not recognize it as it does with the debian 8,The screen goes black, Do not function any of the options, neither graphic mode, nor install, or expert.
After selecting some, the screen tries to load, then turns black, in ocaciones loads the expert mode and is allowed to install but unfortunately the light went out and did not recognize it again
64-bit live cd also does not load
