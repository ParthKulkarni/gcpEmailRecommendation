Package: debian-installer
Version: 20170615
Severity: wishlist
Dear Maintainer,
This bug is for live-installer, please push it there. It's not found
in an updated buster index.
[$] aptitude search live-installer
[$]
Currently there doesn't seem to be any difference in the UI while
either using the regular D-I or Debian Live as can be seen from the
screenshot. I do not know how feasible it might be, but would be nice
if we could have the live-installer name it Debian Live either in the
upper right or left-hand corner. This probably would need services of
live-wrapper and our resident art expert Valessio Brito (hence also
CCing the wishlist bug to him) .
Look forward to know if it's feasible.
