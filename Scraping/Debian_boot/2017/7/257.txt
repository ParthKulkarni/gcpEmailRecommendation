Hi Anton,
First off: please avoid sending html-only mails, this makes people want
to kill them with fire instead of replying.

That's fine, even if debian-user or so would get your a wider audience.

There are a number of components in d-i which can touch policy-rc.d, but
notably running in-target will get you chroot_setup and chroot_cleanup
called, which are exposed through chroot-setup.sh. The former function
is responsible for making sure there's a policy-rc.d script in place,
the latter for cleaning it up.
Then, apt-install leverages in-target, so that's quite normal to have
the behaviour you're describing. I'd probably go for running a compound
command starting by removing the policy-rc.d file, then only installing
your packages; all of this wrapped by in-target.

Please contact the relevant maintainers, maybe through a bug report.
That's not for debian-boot@.

Same as above.
