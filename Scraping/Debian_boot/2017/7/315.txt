It looks like clearfog supports distro_bootcmd in mainline u-boot
2017.07 shipped in buster, including CONFIG_SUPPORT_RAW_INITRD, which is
required to boot an initrd without u-boot headers.
On a related note, nobody has requested the clearfog target be enabled
in the u-boot packages in Debian:
  https://wiki.debian.org/U-boot/
If someone can offer to regularly test that, I'd be happy to enable it
in u-boot.
I don't think that should be a blocker for including it into
flash-kernel, though.
