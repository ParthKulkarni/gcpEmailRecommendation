The (proposed) attached patch seems to fix this issue in "standalone"
mode.  However, it needs to be tested when tasksel is run from d-i to
ensure it doesn't regress anything.  I have only tested it in
"standalone" mode.
Note: when testing it standalone, use "tasksel -t" to avoid changes to
an installed system.

Yeah.  The attached patch does not address either the blocking of SIGINT
and SIGQUIT, nor does it address the lack of a "confirm action" dialog
before tasksel will do its thing.
But with the patch, at least there is now an "exit" button when it is
run in standalone mode...
