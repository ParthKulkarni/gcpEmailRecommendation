As far as I know, git is only for unstable Debian-Installer (d-i)

If you are building on *and* for (stable) Stretch on HPPA,
apt-get update
apt-get source -d debian-installer

Please look in
d-i/build/config/common
OR (dirty but works)
If you are only downloading your kernel & modules you may do a hack in
source of:
< https://packages.debian.org/stretch/base-installer >
and rebuild the udeb(s) and place them under
d-i/build/localudebs/
Might also work (have not tested) by
doing a hack in source -- by adding your mirror to be listed:
< https://packages.debian.org/stretch/choose-mirror >
and rebuild the udeb(s) and place them under
d-i/build/localudebs/
*Add* name of created UDEBs in proper format into list:
d-i/build/pkg-lists/[directory image]/*cfg
