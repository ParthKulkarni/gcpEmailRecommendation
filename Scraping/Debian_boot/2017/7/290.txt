Comments/Problems:
If I install Debian and GRUB2 on my 80 GB HD with my other disk connected, then it will end with black screen and no error message.
Do I install Debian and GRUB2 on my 80 GB HD without my other drives connected, then boot is OK. If I turn off the machine and connect my other disks, start the maskinen and in the bios selects the boot to my 80 GB HD, then I get this message:

mount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory

No init found. Try passing init=bootorg.
The problem has been the same on all Debian ver. 9 which I've tried.
There are no problems with Debian ver. 8.x..
