Yes, this is ok, but many desktop computers are not capable of booting from an 
usb-stick. However, there should be the possibilty added to boot from a cdrom 
and then somehow use the usb-stick. Or is this already possible?

So the 32-bit stuff is always needed for the LTSP? I see. And of course, I 
understand it is much work to split 32-bit and 64-bit. My idea was, if you 
just need to enter one single variable in a script, to get 2 seperated isos, 
then you shopuld have done it. But a it is more work than this, let it as it 
is.

Well I am using a small system for my testing purposes. Just a 64-bit system 
with 1 GB RAM, 2,6GHz CPU, 64-bit, 2 network cards and a 120GB sata drive. It 
is not a productive system, just for myself to lear about the installation 
process. 120GB should be enough, and debian-edu 8 was working well.
I tried text installation and graphical installation, just as customers would 
do. But I came in trouble, as I wrote. Strangewise I have the feeling, that 
graphics- and textinstallation differ. Partitioning looks different, somehow, 
but could not prove it yet.
As I have a very slow bandwith at the moment (50kB/sec) , it is PITA to 
install via CDROM, and usb-stick is not bootable. Thus I have to download all 
the stuff from the internet, and there I went in trouble with the space on 
/var, I wrote about.

Not much more needed, on my tests there were just 3-5 MB missing, but you 
should spend more, as packages may grow from time to time.
How about jigdo? I like jigdo for creating installation DVDs, as they were 
also easy updatable. And jigdo is already configured for debian DVDs, just an 
idea!

Youre welcome! It might last some time, as I am not always have time to test 
things.
