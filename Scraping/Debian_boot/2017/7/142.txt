Package: debian-installer
Severity: normal
Dear Maintainer,
I'm performing an expert-mode non-graphical install from the stretch d-i
netinst ISO. I've got as far as the task selection screen. I deselected
everything (including standard system utilities) and selected "Back" rather
than "continue" (trying to provoke d-i to bring me back to the list of
options/stages, rather than continuing to install software)
Instead, d-i has now begun to install packages... 1497 of them, including
lots of X-related packages according to the log. so it would appear that,
having not confirmed my deselection of the tasks, the default selection of
tasks are selected and d-i has embarked on installing them, despite me not
pressing "continue".
This is very counterintuitive!
