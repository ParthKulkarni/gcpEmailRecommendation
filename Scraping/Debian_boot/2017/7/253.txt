Package: src:debian-installer
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
Trying to install Debian 9.0 x86_64 from CD via qemu with virtio
device for cdrom results in installer unable to find the CD drive.
The expected behaviour is that virtio drivers are present in the
initramfs as these are common when installing Debian in a VM.
Workaround is to use ide-cd or similar emulation.
