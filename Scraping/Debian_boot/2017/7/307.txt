Package: partman-partitioning
Severity: normal
Just found an edge case when doing installation testing. If you start
with a GPT-partitioned disk (after doing a UEFI test installation),
then go for manual partman setup on a BIOS boot (e.g. to do a RAID
test), the system will happily keep the existing partition type.
That's fine, but right at the end of my installation I couldn't
install grub-pc due to the GPT setup. It's partly my own fault here
with the manual partitioning, but there are no visual cues to remind
anyone what the partition type is on the disks. That should probably
be fixed.
