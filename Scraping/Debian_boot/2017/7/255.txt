Yes Windows requires UEFI to match in bit level.

At least in Debian 8, I believe the only media to support 32bit UEFI
was the i386/amd64 multiarch net install image.  I know I have used that
one successfully on an intel system with 32bit UEFI.
I didn't check if Debian 9 has similar limits on 32bit UEFI support in
the installer.  It is a pretty rare system type to encounter fortunately.
