Package: rescue
Version: 1.64
Tags: patch
Severity: important
Dear Maintainer,
   * What led up to the situation?
        Trying to recover a debian machine using rescue, after mounting the
target disk, trying to open a shell in the target
   * What was the outcome of this action?
        Informed no shell could be found (or dropped to a shell, but not bash)
   * What outcome did you expect instead?
        Correctlly end up in a shell with bash
In the chroot_has function, the PATH variable is set to $CHROOT_PATH which does
not contain the script search-path (as this only exists in the installer env).
Therefore this call fails.
Changing this to the absolute path resolves the issue
