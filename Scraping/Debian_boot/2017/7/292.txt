I need to copy some files off of an old system that users reiserfs 3.6

Fortunately when I pulled out my favorite tool Debian's installer 
recognized the raid and correctly identified all the partitions, but 
the reiserfs would not mount and I did not see the udebs 
(https://packages.debian.org/jessie/reiserfsprogs) listed as 
available. Does anyone have any guidance on how to proceed.
I believe there are udebs for both ssh client and server, so you could 
use one or the other to just copy the raw block device off, then work on 
the image from whatever system you want. Working with copies only is 
generally a good idea for data recovery anyway.
ought to work. You can confirm the copy succeeded by comparing SHA256 
(etc.) checksums; I think there is a checksum utility available.
PS: Debian-boot is a development list, you probably want debian-user.
