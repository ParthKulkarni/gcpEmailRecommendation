Hi,
since SSDs are becoming more and more common it would be great to see support 
for TRIM command enabled in the debian-installer. It took me quite some time 
to figure out how to do this (again, because the last time I had to look up the 
commands was four years ago).
Since not everyone likes to have TRIM support enabled, it would be apropriate 
to have this as an option if an SSD is detected, maybe even only in the expert 
install option. (In my opinion TRIM should be enabled by default, because 
regular users don't know what TRIM is, but still want it enabled)
To figure out if a device has TRIM capability you can use hdparm:
hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep 'TRIM'
If the user is using LVM then TRIM has also enabled in the lvm.conf by adding 
issue_discards = 1 to the devices section.
If the user is using dmcrypt (and this is be the point where it might be 
problematic to use TRIM, see [0]) then it has to be enabled in the crypttab 
file by adding "discard" to the target options.
As final step it is necessary to enable the discard feature for the filesystem 
or run fstrim regularly, if the filesystem supports it.
It is recommend to run fstrim regularly, because the discard feature is said 
to be slow, because it runs a trim on every file deletion. It should be better 
to run fstrim daily or weekly by a script.
Please see [1] for more detailed information about how to enable TRIM. There's 
also a script shown that does fstrim. It does it's job, although I recommed to 
whitelist the supported filesystems, since fstrim fails for vfat, which is used 
for EFI partitions everywhere now and lsblk lists them as valid targets to 
fstrim.
Best regards
Matthias
