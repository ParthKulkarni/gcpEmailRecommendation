Package: win32-loader
Followup-For: Bug #824648
I tried to install Debian (9.0) on a Tablet with Windows 10 Home. 
* SSD-Harddrive with GPT
* 2 GB RAM
* 64 bit CPU
* UEFI-BIOS
After restart I got the error 0xc000007b and error message for g2ldr.mbr
As it turned out, the UEFI (and Windows) was only 32 bit(!)
Eventuelly I managed to create a bootable USB key. It needed a EFI/BOOT/bootia32.efi file to work.
The problem might be related to the 32 bit system instead of 64 bit.
