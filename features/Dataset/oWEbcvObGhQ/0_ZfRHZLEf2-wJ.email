Subject: String concatenation evaluates Right to Left, not Left to Right.

I was a little surprised to find that string concatenation (using the
+ operator) evaluates right-left, as the Go language spec says that
all binary operators evaluate left-right. Have I missed some subtlety,
or is this an undocumented language feature?

I am using the 8g compiler on Ubuntu 9.10, and I am seeing this with
s := f() + f() + f(); where f() returns a string. I apologize if this
is well known, as I have tried to search for it.
