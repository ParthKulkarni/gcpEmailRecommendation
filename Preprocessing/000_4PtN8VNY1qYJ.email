Subject: Searchability of "go"

I've been looking at go for the past week or two, and it looks
promising.  I plan to replace one of our high-volume services
(currently in Java) with a go-based server to see how it handles the
load.  One question I had was, which compiler is better for production
- gccgo or 6g/6l?

My other question was about searchability of Go in job postings.   I
tried searching for job postings mentioning Go, and found
(unsurprisingly) that searching for [Go] brings up lots of irrelevant
job postings.  See e.g. http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=go  I also
searched for [golang] and ["google go"], which didn't bring up any
postings (there simply may not be any, yet).  Has anyone thought about
which term job postings should use so people searching for Go jobs can
find them?  "Golang" is unique enough, but "Go" probably isn't.  (I
work at the job search engine indeed.com).   Thanks,
